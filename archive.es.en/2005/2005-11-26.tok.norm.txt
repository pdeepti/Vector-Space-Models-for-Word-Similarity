the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .
" the issue has been brought to our attention , " commission competition spokesman jonathan todd told reporters .
" we do n't yet have any conclusions .
we are actively pursuing the matter . "
abuse of ticket monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every soccer fan has gotten a kick out of the ticket ordering process potential spectators to games at the 12 venues around germany must pay the non-refundable fee as well as the full price of the tickets months ahead of the february 2006 draw .
should they lose the lottery , the ticket money will be refunded .
nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister otto schily implemented strict security measures for the world cup in order to guarantee the safety of the 64 games that will be played from june 9 to july 9 next year , fifa demanded basic personal information be included on tickets .
the measures were slammed by data protection groups .
the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .
some critics have said the 2006 world cup was turning into a stage for corporate sponsors rather than for the teams or the supporters .
in may , the european commission forced the organizers to change their ticket sales system , which had previously granted holders of mastercard , a world cup sponsor , lower ticket fees if they paid with the red and yellow plastic card . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu upholds world cup ticket complaint the much-maligned world cup ticketing system took another blow on monday when the european commission upheld a complaint from a consumer group which claimed the system was discriminative .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .
" the issue has been brought to our attention , " commission competition spokesman jonathan todd told reporters .
" we do n't yet have any conclusions .
we are actively pursuing the matter . "
abuse of ticket monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every soccer fan has gotten a kick out of the ticket ordering process potential spectators to games at the 12 venues around germany must pay the non-refundable fee as well as the full price of the tickets months ahead of the february 2006 draw .
should they lose the lottery , the ticket money will be refunded .
nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister otto schily implemented strict security measures for the world cup in order to guarantee the safety of the 64 games that will be played from june 9 to july 9 next year , fifa demanded basic personal information be included on tickets .
the measures were slammed by data protection groups .
the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .
some critics have said the 2006 world cup was turning into a stage for corporate sponsors rather than for the teams or the supporters .
in may , the european commission forced the organizers to change their ticket sales system , which had previously granted holders of mastercard , a world cup sponsor , lower ticket fees if they paid with the red and yellow plastic card . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu upholds world cup ticket complaint the much-maligned world cup ticketing system took another blow on monday when the european commission upheld a complaint from a consumer group which claimed the system was discriminative .

some critics have said the 2006 world cup was turning into a stage for corporate sponsors rather than for the teams or the supporters .

"
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "
washington under pressure the denial came as washington felt mounting european pressure to reveal the routes and activities of its cia prisoner flights amid concerns about human rights abuses and torture on european territory .
reports of cia plane touch-downs have come from countries as far apart as macedonia , finland and portugal in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe often acts as a human rights watchdog the council of europe opened a probe this week , but top investigator dick marty , of switzerland , conceded saturday that he had " practically no methods of constraint " to stop the flights to change cia methods . the council 's member states have until feb .
21 to provide information to the inquiry , which will examine governments ' compliance with european human rights law and whether officials have been involved in " unacknowledged " detentions or transport of detainees . " the council of europe can not adopt specific measures against the united states , " marty told the times newspaper in geneva .
but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .
" those responsible must pay " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana told spanish radio on saturday that europeans found any suggestion of torture " intolerable " and insisted that such reports be investigated . " i have no doubt that this will be the object of an investigation ...
it must be investigated and those responsible must pay , " he told cadena ser radio . meanwhile , turkish transport minister binali yildirim confirmed that a cia plane had " put down " at the sabiha gokcen airport in istanbul last week in order to refuel . " there was a landing requested for technical reasons .
its landing was authorized .
it was not carrying any passengers - only equipment was on board , " the minister was quoted as saying by the anatolia news agency .
" it filled its tanks with fuel and continued in its way , " he said , adding that when planes requested landings to refuel it was difficult to refuse them . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability . " he wants to set a date for starting talks with macedonia during the eu summit in december . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells romania , bulgaria to step up reforms romania and bulgaria greeted tuesday an eu report on their eventual membership of the 25-nation bloc as fair , even though it called on both countries to push ahead with reforms and threatened both with accession delays .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability . " he wants to set a date for starting talks with macedonia during the eu summit in december . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells romania , bulgaria to step up reforms romania and bulgaria greeted tuesday an eu report on their eventual membership of the 25-nation bloc as fair , even though it called on both countries to push ahead with reforms and threatened both with accession delays .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "
washington under pressure the denial came as washington felt mounting european pressure to reveal the routes and activities of its cia prisoner flights amid concerns about human rights abuses and torture on european territory .
reports of cia plane touch-downs have come from countries as far apart as macedonia , finland and portugal in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe often acts as a human rights watchdog the council of europe opened a probe this week , but top investigator dick marty , of switzerland , conceded saturday that he had " practically no methods of constraint " to stop the flights to change cia methods . the council 's member states have until feb .
21 to provide information to the inquiry , which will examine governments ' compliance with european human rights law and whether officials have been involved in " unacknowledged " detentions or transport of detainees . " the council of europe can not adopt specific measures against the united states , " marty told the times newspaper in geneva .
but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .
" those responsible must pay " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana told spanish radio on saturday that europeans found any suggestion of torture " intolerable " and insisted that such reports be investigated . " i have no doubt that this will be the object of an investigation ...
it must be investigated and those responsible must pay , " he told cadena ser radio . meanwhile , turkish transport minister binali yildirim confirmed that a cia plane had " put down " at the sabiha gokcen airport in istanbul last week in order to refuel . " there was a landing requested for technical reasons .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability . " he wants to set a date for starting talks with macedonia during the eu summit in december . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells romania , bulgaria to step up reforms romania and bulgaria greeted tuesday an eu report on their eventual membership of the 25-nation bloc as fair , even though it called on both countries to push ahead with reforms and threatened both with accession delays .

gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "
washington under pressure the denial came as washington felt mounting european pressure to reveal the routes and activities of its cia prisoner flights amid concerns about human rights abuses and torture on european territory .

but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .
" those responsible must pay " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana told spanish radio on saturday that europeans found any suggestion of torture " intolerable " and insisted that such reports be investigated .

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .

" we do n't yet have any conclusions .

nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .

that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters .

" we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability . " he wants to set a date for starting talks with macedonia during the eu summit in december . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells romania , bulgaria to step up reforms romania and bulgaria greeted tuesday an eu report on their eventual membership of the 25-nation bloc as fair , even though it called on both countries to push ahead with reforms and threatened both with accession delays .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .

how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .

" four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability . " he wants to set a date for starting talks with macedonia during the eu summit in december . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells romania , bulgaria to step up reforms romania and bulgaria greeted tuesday an eu report on their eventual membership of the 25-nation bloc as fair , even though it called on both countries to push ahead with reforms and threatened both with accession delays .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .

that 's four more stars than in 2005 .

a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cooks impress too in addition to giving out new stars , michelin also instituted a sort of " watch this space " notation for chefs who seem on the track to improvement .

star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .
it ties the rise in restaurant stars to an attempt to pump up the waning financial fortunes of the german restaurant industry .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .
the food , wine , decor and service will be exceptional and you should expect to pay highly for it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , germany 's " best cook " has a nearly perfect score with gault millau two more restaurants got two-star designation - meaning the the restaurant deserves a detour , everything will be top-notch , if not perfect , and again you should not expect a bargain - bringing the number in germany up to 15 .
and 161 restaurants carry one star - if it 's on your way , you should stop , and the restaurant should serve very good food in a pleasant environment .
that 's four more stars than in 2005 .
' red bible ' the red-colored michelin guide is considered the bible for those obsessed with fine cuisine , and it tends to favor french classic cooking over modern styles .
as much as it is revered , the system has come under criticism for carrying disproportional weight .
the awarding - or removal - of a star can make or break an establishment .
a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .
along with schloss berg 's christian bau , who got his third star , the country 's new two-star cooks are juan amador of amador in hessen and sven elverfeld from the restaurant aqua in wolfsburg , the town in lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarter is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cooks impress too in addition to giving out new stars , michelin also instituted a sort of " watch this space " notation for chefs who seem on the track to improvement .
some of them are awaiting their first stars ; others , like eric menchon of cologne 's le moissonier , are hoping for a second .
for food lovers , this precipitous rise in star gastronomy begs the question : what the heck is going on here ?
how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .
it ties the rise in restaurant stars to an attempt to pump up the waning financial fortunes of the german restaurant industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bühner 's la table has two michelin stars and 19 gault millau points for the past four years , german restaurants have published massive drops in sales , according to a recent story on foodie web site best-of-wine.com.

only hamburg 's win helps keep some semblance of excitement in the bundesliga . bayern munich manager felix magath need n't worry so much about the scoring drought of his top striker roy makaay .
claudio pizarro has taken up the slack more than enough of late .
after single-handedly beating bielefeld last week , he repeated his performance this week against an equally weak opponent -lrb- on paper -rrb- and scored twice in bayern 's 2-1 victory over mainz at the allianz arena .
the peruvian attacker , who has scored five times in the last three bundesliga fixtures , has become a dependable source of goals for munich since the injury to striker roque santa cruz has given him a permanent starting slot .
he put his side up in the 28th minute , but cheeky mainz pulled back even in the 33rd minute .
pizarro ended mainz ' dream of being the first team to take a point from munich at the allianz arena with a strike early in the second half .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz goalie dimo wache held this shot from claudio pizarro but the peruvian scored twice " it was not a vintage performance and mainz made us tremble until the final minute , " admitted magath .
" we should have scored more goals in the first half and wrapped the game up . "
only one team in the league is equally potent up front as bayern munich : werder bermen .
on saturday , manager thomas schaaf was without the services of his two star strikers - german international miroslav klose -lrb- 14 goals -rrb- and croatian attacker ivan klasnic -lrb- 8 goals -rrb- - and it hurt his side as the northern germans lost 2-1 at schalke .
" despite the injuries , we played attacking soccer and stayed true to our style of play .
but of course you ca n't replace klose and klasnic , " was schaaf 's assessment .
bremen now lie eight points back of munich .
hamburg now in second hamburg pulled ahead of their northern rival bremen by sneaking off with a 1-0 victory at leverkusen .
just as it looked like the match would end in a scoreless draw , david jarolim was in the right place at the right time and put home the gamewinner eight minutes from time .
manager thomas doll 's side kept pace with bayern and are six points back , but with each passing week , many are wondering who can put the brakes on the munich express .

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .
" the issue has been brought to our attention , " commission competition spokesman jonathan todd told reporters .
" we do n't yet have any conclusions .
we are actively pursuing the matter . "
abuse of ticket monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every soccer fan has gotten a kick out of the ticket ordering process potential spectators to games at the 12 venues around germany must pay the non-refundable fee as well as the full price of the tickets months ahead of the february 2006 draw .
should they lose the lottery , the ticket money will be refunded .
nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister otto schily implemented strict security measures for the world cup in order to guarantee the safety of the 64 games that will be played from june 9 to july 9 next year , fifa demanded basic personal information be included on tickets .
the measures were slammed by data protection groups .
the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .
some critics have said the 2006 world cup was turning into a stage for corporate sponsors rather than for the teams or the supporters .
in may , the european commission forced the organizers to change their ticket sales system , which had previously granted holders of mastercard , a world cup sponsor , lower ticket fees if they paid with the red and yellow plastic card . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu upholds world cup ticket complaint the much-maligned world cup ticketing system took another blow on monday when the european commission upheld a complaint from a consumer group which claimed the system was discriminative .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "
washington under pressure the denial came as washington felt mounting european pressure to reveal the routes and activities of its cia prisoner flights amid concerns about human rights abuses and torture on european territory .
reports of cia plane touch-downs have come from countries as far apart as macedonia , finland and portugal in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe often acts as a human rights watchdog the council of europe opened a probe this week , but top investigator dick marty , of switzerland , conceded saturday that he had " practically no methods of constraint " to stop the flights to change cia methods . the council 's member states have until feb .
21 to provide information to the inquiry , which will examine governments ' compliance with european human rights law and whether officials have been involved in " unacknowledged " detentions or transport of detainees . " the council of europe can not adopt specific measures against the united states , " marty told the times newspaper in geneva .
but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .
" those responsible must pay " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana told spanish radio on saturday that europeans found any suggestion of torture " intolerable " and insisted that such reports be investigated . " i have no doubt that this will be the object of an investigation ...
it must be investigated and those responsible must pay , " he told cadena ser radio . meanwhile , turkish transport minister binali yildirim confirmed that a cia plane had " put down " at the sabiha gokcen airport in istanbul last week in order to refuel . " there was a landing requested for technical reasons .
its landing was authorized .
it was not carrying any passengers - only equipment was on board , " the minister was quoted as saying by the anatolia news agency .
" it filled its tanks with fuel and continued in its way , " he said , adding that when planes requested landings to refuel it was difficult to refuse them . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe .

"
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .

but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .
" the issue has been brought to our attention , " commission competition spokesman jonathan todd told reporters .
" we do n't yet have any conclusions .
we are actively pursuing the matter . "
abuse of ticket monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every soccer fan has gotten a kick out of the ticket ordering process potential spectators to games at the 12 venues around germany must pay the non-refundable fee as well as the full price of the tickets months ahead of the february 2006 draw .
should they lose the lottery , the ticket money will be refunded .
nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister otto schily implemented strict security measures for the world cup in order to guarantee the safety of the 64 games that will be played from june 9 to july 9 next year , fifa demanded basic personal information be included on tickets .
the measures were slammed by data protection groups .
the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .
some critics have said the 2006 world cup was turning into a stage for corporate sponsors rather than for the teams or the supporters .
in may , the european commission forced the organizers to change their ticket sales system , which had previously granted holders of mastercard , a world cup sponsor , lower ticket fees if they paid with the red and yellow plastic card . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu upholds world cup ticket complaint the much-maligned world cup ticketing system took another blow on monday when the european commission upheld a complaint from a consumer group which claimed the system was discriminative .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .
the food , wine , decor and service will be exceptional and you should expect to pay highly for it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , germany 's " best cook " has a nearly perfect score with gault millau two more restaurants got two-star designation - meaning the the restaurant deserves a detour , everything will be top-notch , if not perfect , and again you should not expect a bargain - bringing the number in germany up to 15 .
and 161 restaurants carry one star - if it 's on your way , you should stop , and the restaurant should serve very good food in a pleasant environment .
that 's four more stars than in 2005 .
' red bible ' the red-colored michelin guide is considered the bible for those obsessed with fine cuisine , and it tends to favor french classic cooking over modern styles .
as much as it is revered , the system has come under criticism for carrying disproportional weight .
the awarding - or removal - of a star can make or break an establishment .
a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .
along with schloss berg 's christian bau , who got his third star , the country 's new two-star cooks are juan amador of amador in hessen and sven elverfeld from the restaurant aqua in wolfsburg , the town in lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarter is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cooks impress too in addition to giving out new stars , michelin also instituted a sort of " watch this space " notation for chefs who seem on the track to improvement .
some of them are awaiting their first stars ; others , like eric menchon of cologne 's le moissonier , are hoping for a second .
for food lovers , this precipitous rise in star gastronomy begs the question : what the heck is going on here ?
how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .
it ties the rise in restaurant stars to an attempt to pump up the waning financial fortunes of the german restaurant industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bühner 's la table has two michelin stars and 19 gault millau points for the past four years , german restaurants have published massive drops in sales , according to a recent story on foodie web site best-of-wine.com.
inflating the stars awarded is one way of generating interest .
the press release michelin gave out with its newest guide notes " new optimism after many businesses closed their doors and following hard years of competition in gastronomy and hotellery . "
yet , according to best-of-wine , the clearest sign of new optimism is the surge in star chefs .
" current polls show that christmas bookings are only a shadow of what they typically used to be , " the site wrote .
even if best-of-wine is right , and the proliferation of stars is a bit artificial , the news is n't all bad .

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .
" the issue has been brought to our attention , " commission competition spokesman jonathan todd told reporters .
" we do n't yet have any conclusions .
we are actively pursuing the matter . "
abuse of ticket monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every soccer fan has gotten a kick out of the ticket ordering process potential spectators to games at the 12 venues around germany must pay the non-refundable fee as well as the full price of the tickets months ahead of the february 2006 draw .
should they lose the lottery , the ticket money will be refunded .
nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister otto schily implemented strict security measures for the world cup in order to guarantee the safety of the 64 games that will be played from june 9 to july 9 next year , fifa demanded basic personal information be included on tickets .
the measures were slammed by data protection groups .
the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability . " he wants to set a date for starting talks with macedonia during the eu summit in december . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells romania , bulgaria to step up reforms romania and bulgaria greeted tuesday an eu report on their eventual membership of the 25-nation bloc as fair , even though it called on both countries to push ahead with reforms and threatened both with accession delays .

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .
" the issue has been brought to our attention , " commission competition spokesman jonathan todd told reporters .
" we do n't yet have any conclusions .
we are actively pursuing the matter . "
abuse of ticket monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every soccer fan has gotten a kick out of the ticket ordering process potential spectators to games at the 12 venues around germany must pay the non-refundable fee as well as the full price of the tickets months ahead of the february 2006 draw .
should they lose the lottery , the ticket money will be refunded .
nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister otto schily implemented strict security measures for the world cup in order to guarantee the safety of the 64 games that will be played from june 9 to july 9 next year , fifa demanded basic personal information be included on tickets .
the measures were slammed by data protection groups .
the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .
some critics have said the 2006 world cup was turning into a stage for corporate sponsors rather than for the teams or the supporters .
in may , the european commission forced the organizers to change their ticket sales system , which had previously granted holders of mastercard , a world cup sponsor , lower ticket fees if they paid with the red and yellow plastic card . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu upholds world cup ticket complaint the much-maligned world cup ticketing system took another blow on monday when the european commission upheld a complaint from a consumer group which claimed the system was discriminative .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .
the food , wine , decor and service will be exceptional and you should expect to pay highly for it .

and 161 restaurants carry one star - if it 's on your way , you should stop , and the restaurant should serve very good food in a pleasant environment .
that 's four more stars than in 2005 .
' red bible ' the red-colored michelin guide is considered the bible for those obsessed with fine cuisine , and it tends to favor french classic cooking over modern styles .
as much as it is revered , the system has come under criticism for carrying disproportional weight .
the awarding - or removal - of a star can make or break an establishment .
a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cooks impress too in addition to giving out new stars , michelin also instituted a sort of " watch this space " notation for chefs who seem on the track to improvement .
some of them are awaiting their first stars ; others , like eric menchon of cologne 's le moissonier , are hoping for a second .
for food lovers , this precipitous rise in star gastronomy begs the question : what the heck is going on here ?
how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .
it ties the rise in restaurant stars to an attempt to pump up the waning financial fortunes of the german restaurant industry .

the press release michelin gave out with its newest guide notes " new optimism after many businesses closed their doors and following hard years of competition in gastronomy and hotellery . "
yet , according to best-of-wine , the clearest sign of new optimism is the surge in star chefs .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .
the food , wine , decor and service will be exceptional and you should expect to pay highly for it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , germany 's " best cook " has a nearly perfect score with gault millau two more restaurants got two-star designation - meaning the the restaurant deserves a detour , everything will be top-notch , if not perfect , and again you should not expect a bargain - bringing the number in germany up to 15 .
and 161 restaurants carry one star - if it 's on your way , you should stop , and the restaurant should serve very good food in a pleasant environment .
that 's four more stars than in 2005 .
' red bible ' the red-colored michelin guide is considered the bible for those obsessed with fine cuisine , and it tends to favor french classic cooking over modern styles .
as much as it is revered , the system has come under criticism for carrying disproportional weight .
the awarding - or removal - of a star can make or break an establishment .
a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .
along with schloss berg 's christian bau , who got his third star , the country 's new two-star cooks are juan amador of amador in hessen and sven elverfeld from the restaurant aqua in wolfsburg , the town in lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarter is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cooks impress too in addition to giving out new stars , michelin also instituted a sort of " watch this space " notation for chefs who seem on the track to improvement .
some of them are awaiting their first stars ; others , like eric menchon of cologne 's le moissonier , are hoping for a second .
for food lovers , this precipitous rise in star gastronomy begs the question : what the heck is going on here ?
how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .
it ties the rise in restaurant stars to an attempt to pump up the waning financial fortunes of the german restaurant industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bühner 's la table has two michelin stars and 19 gault millau points for the past four years , german restaurants have published massive drops in sales , according to a recent story on foodie web site best-of-wine.com.
inflating the stars awarded is one way of generating interest .
the press release michelin gave out with its newest guide notes " new optimism after many businesses closed their doors and following hard years of competition in gastronomy and hotellery . "
yet , according to best-of-wine , the clearest sign of new optimism is the surge in star chefs .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe .

"
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "
washington under pressure the denial came as washington felt mounting european pressure to reveal the routes and activities of its cia prisoner flights amid concerns about human rights abuses and torture on european territory .
reports of cia plane touch-downs have come from countries as far apart as macedonia , finland and portugal in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe often acts as a human rights watchdog the council of europe opened a probe this week , but top investigator dick marty , of switzerland , conceded saturday that he had " practically no methods of constraint " to stop the flights to change cia methods . the council 's member states have until feb .

" the council of europe can not adopt specific measures against the united states , " marty told the times newspaper in geneva .
but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .
" those responsible must pay " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana told spanish radio on saturday that europeans found any suggestion of torture " intolerable " and insisted that such reports be investigated . " i have no doubt that this will be the object of an investigation ...
it must be investigated and those responsible must pay , " he told cadena ser radio . meanwhile , turkish transport minister binali yildirim confirmed that a cia plane had " put down " at the sabiha gokcen airport in istanbul last week in order to refuel . " there was a landing requested for technical reasons .
its landing was authorized .
it was not carrying any passengers - only equipment was on board , " the minister was quoted as saying by the anatolia news agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.11.2005 many eu states want doors to membership shut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only a few years ago , macedonia was at war an uproar is brewing between eu member states and the european commission over enlargement policies - particularly over letting in balkan states . some eu members are shrugging off a suggestion that membership talks should begin with macedonia and other balkan states .
others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .

and 161 restaurants carry one star - if it 's on your way , you should stop , and the restaurant should serve very good food in a pleasant environment .
that 's four more stars than in 2005 .
' red bible ' the red-colored michelin guide is considered the bible for those obsessed with fine cuisine , and it tends to favor french classic cooking over modern styles .
as much as it is revered , the system has come under criticism for carrying disproportional weight .
the awarding - or removal - of a star can make or break an establishment .
a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .
along with schloss berg 's christian bau , who got his third star , the country 's new two-star cooks are juan amador of amador in hessen and sven elverfeld from the restaurant aqua in wolfsburg , the town in lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarter is .

star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "
washington under pressure the denial came as washington felt mounting european pressure to reveal the routes and activities of its cia prisoner flights amid concerns about human rights abuses and torture on european territory .

" the council of europe can not adopt specific measures against the united states , " marty told the times newspaper in geneva .
but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .
" those responsible must pay " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana told spanish radio on saturday that europeans found any suggestion of torture " intolerable " and insisted that such reports be investigated . " i have no doubt that this will be the object of an investigation ...
it must be investigated and those responsible must pay , " he told cadena ser radio . meanwhile , turkish transport minister binali yildirim confirmed that a cia plane had " put down " at the sabiha gokcen airport in istanbul last week in order to refuel . " there was a landing requested for technical reasons .
its landing was authorized .
it was not carrying any passengers - only equipment was on board , " the minister was quoted as saying by the anatolia news agency .
" it filled its tanks with fuel and continued in its way , " he said , adding that when planes requested landings to refuel it was difficult to refuse them . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

the peruvian attacker , who has scored five times in the last three bundesliga fixtures , has become a dependable source of goals for munich since the injury to striker roque santa cruz has given him a permanent starting slot .

on saturday , manager thomas schaaf was without the services of his two star strikers - german international miroslav klose -lrb- 14 goals -rrb- and croatian attacker ivan klasnic -lrb- 8 goals -rrb- - and it hurt his side as the northern germans lost 2-1 at schalke .
" despite the injuries , we played attacking soccer and stayed true to our style of play .
but of course you ca n't replace klose and klasnic , " was schaaf 's assessment .
bremen now lie eight points back of munich .
hamburg now in second hamburg pulled ahead of their northern rival bremen by sneaking off with a 1-0 victory at leverkusen .
just as it looked like the match would end in a scoreless draw , david jarolim was in the right place at the right time and put home the gamewinner eight minutes from time .
manager thomas doll 's side kept pace with bayern and are six points back , but with each passing week , many are wondering who can put the brakes on the munich express .

stefan kiessling scored the consolation goal for the hosts two minutes from time .

boubacar sanogo found the net for the red devils from kaiserslautern who have n't won since the third week .

but in the 68th minute , bastürck finally managed to put the ball in the net for the berliners , and eight minutes later kovac brought the score to 2-2 with a header .
vfb stuttgart manager trappatoni has some explaining to do after his players drew 1-1 against eintracht frankfurt .
amanatidis managed to put frankfurt on top with a goal in the 19th minute , which lasted throughout the first half .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "
washington under pressure the denial came as washington felt mounting european pressure to reveal the routes and activities of its cia prisoner flights amid concerns about human rights abuses and torture on european territory .
reports of cia plane touch-downs have come from countries as far apart as macedonia , finland and portugal in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe often acts as a human rights watchdog the council of europe opened a probe this week , but top investigator dick marty , of switzerland , conceded saturday that he had " practically no methods of constraint " to stop the flights to change cia methods . the council 's member states have until feb .
21 to provide information to the inquiry , which will examine governments ' compliance with european human rights law and whether officials have been involved in " unacknowledged " detentions or transport of detainees . " the council of europe can not adopt specific measures against the united states , " marty told the times newspaper in geneva .
but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .
" those responsible must pay " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana told spanish radio on saturday that europeans found any suggestion of torture " intolerable " and insisted that such reports be investigated . " i have no doubt that this will be the object of an investigation ...
it must be investigated and those responsible must pay , " he told cadena ser radio . meanwhile , turkish transport minister binali yildirim confirmed that a cia plane had " put down " at the sabiha gokcen airport in istanbul last week in order to refuel . " there was a landing requested for technical reasons .
its landing was authorized .
it was not carrying any passengers - only equipment was on board , " the minister was quoted as saying by the anatolia news agency .
" it filled its tanks with fuel and continued in its way , " he said , adding that when planes requested landings to refuel it was difficult to refuse them . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .
the food , wine , decor and service will be exceptional and you should expect to pay highly for it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , germany 's " best cook " has a nearly perfect score with gault millau two more restaurants got two-star designation - meaning the the restaurant deserves a detour , everything will be top-notch , if not perfect , and again you should not expect a bargain - bringing the number in germany up to 15 .
and 161 restaurants carry one star - if it 's on your way , you should stop , and the restaurant should serve very good food in a pleasant environment .
that 's four more stars than in 2005 .
' red bible ' the red-colored michelin guide is considered the bible for those obsessed with fine cuisine , and it tends to favor french classic cooking over modern styles .
as much as it is revered , the system has come under criticism for carrying disproportional weight .
the awarding - or removal - of a star can make or break an establishment .
a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .
along with schloss berg 's christian bau , who got his third star , the country 's new two-star cooks are juan amador of amador in hessen and sven elverfeld from the restaurant aqua in wolfsburg , the town in lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarter is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cooks impress too in addition to giving out new stars , michelin also instituted a sort of " watch this space " notation for chefs who seem on the track to improvement .
some of them are awaiting their first stars ; others , like eric menchon of cologne 's le moissonier , are hoping for a second .
for food lovers , this precipitous rise in star gastronomy begs the question : what the heck is going on here ?
how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .
it ties the rise in restaurant stars to an attempt to pump up the waning financial fortunes of the german restaurant industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bühner 's la table has two michelin stars and 19 gault millau points for the past four years , german restaurants have published massive drops in sales , according to a recent story on foodie web site best-of-wine.com.
inflating the stars awarded is one way of generating interest .
the press release michelin gave out with its newest guide notes " new optimism after many businesses closed their doors and following hard years of competition in gastronomy and hotellery . "
yet , according to best-of-wine , the clearest sign of new optimism is the surge in star chefs .
" current polls show that christmas bookings are only a shadow of what they typically used to be , " the site wrote .
even if best-of-wine is right , and the proliferation of stars is a bit artificial , the news is n't all bad .
in the past decade , german cooking has undergone a renaissance .

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .
" the issue has been brought to our attention , " commission competition spokesman jonathan todd told reporters .
" we do n't yet have any conclusions .
we are actively pursuing the matter . "

should they lose the lottery , the ticket money will be refunded .
nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .

the measures were slammed by data protection groups .
the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .
some critics have said the 2006 world cup was turning into a stage for corporate sponsors rather than for the teams or the supporters .
in may , the european commission forced the organizers to change their ticket sales system , which had previously granted holders of mastercard , a world cup sponsor , lower ticket fees if they paid with the red and yellow plastic card . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu upholds world cup ticket complaint the much-maligned world cup ticketing system took another blow on monday when the european commission upheld a complaint from a consumer group which claimed the system was discriminative .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .

macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability .

others are downright hostile . " macedonia is in no way stable or ready , " one eu diplomat , who wished to remain anonymous , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . regardless , the european commission said earlier this month that eu member states should accept macedonia as a candidate to join the european union , despite the ex-yugoslav republic having some administrative weaknesses . that followed stabilization and association agreement talks between the country and the european union in april 2001 and candidature status was later granted after the country met a series of reform requirements . the balkan country signed a nato-backed agreement in august 2001 to end a bloody insurgency by ethnic albanian rebels seeking greater social and political rights . one-way ticket macedonia 's prime minister said the european commission 's decision earlier this month to recommend his country as an eu candidate was a " one-way ticket " to full membership of the 25-nation bloc . " the issue of whether or not macedonia is going to be a member of the eu is now closed , " prime minister vlado buckovski told reporters .
" we had the strategic aim of becoming a member of the eu and now we 've got a one-way ticket .
macedonia and its citizens got recognition for creating a positive multicultural and democratic society . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : macedonians - and their neighbors - are hopeful describing the ex-yugoslav state as a european success story , eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn praised the government for turning macedonia around in just a few years in spite of the work that remains to be done . " four years ago , in 2001 , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia was at the brink of a civil war , now today in 2005 it is seriously knocking on the eu 's door , " he told reporters .
" the country is a european and more general success story in terms of political stability and democratic development . " eu ' stretched to limits ' over enlargement that success is irrelevant to many eu states which maintain that the eu has grown too much , too fast and become unwieldy .
that opposition is particularly strong in central europe and greece . rehn has conceded that the eu must explain to citizens why it continues to accept new members . " our enlargement agenda is very heavy indeed , and our absorption capacity is stretched to its limits , " he told reporters . " we need to consolidate our enlargement agenda , in other words we need to be very cautious with any new commitments , but at the same time we need to stand by our existing commitments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : use membership to create a stable europe , rehn says the eu grew to 25 member states in may 2004 when it brought on board 10 mainly former communist states in a " big bang " expansion .
romania and bulgaria , two other former eastern-bloc countries , are due to join in 2007 , and turkey and croatia began membership talks last month . turkey , a vast , relatively poor and mainly muslim state , has been given no guarantees that it will be admitted , and its accession talks are expected to last at least a decade .
macedonia has been given no date for the beginning of accession talks . after macedonia , the eu has also promised to consider membership for albania , bosnia-herzegovina and serbia-montenegro . problem is administrative , rehn says rehn said the enlargement problem was as much administrative as financial . " the budgetary implications of any future enlargement will have to be taken very seriously into account as well as the institutional consequences , " he said . the enlargement process has also been clouded by referendums earlier this year in france and the netherlands in which voters roundly rejected the union 's planned constitution . among their reasons for voting " no , " some voters cited the eu 's apparent willingness to continue to expand without end and bring in turkey , which would push the bloc 's borders to the middle east . but rehn added that it was still vital to offer the incentive of membership to unstable countries , particularly the balkan states , which were wracked by conflict in the 1990s . " we have to see the accession process of the european union as a tool for enhancing the stability of that region , " he said , adding that it was a more question of " exporting stability to the western balkans than importing instability . " he wants to set a date for starting talks with macedonia during the eu summit in december . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells romania , bulgaria to step up reforms romania and bulgaria greeted tuesday an eu report on their eventual membership of the 25-nation bloc as fair , even though it called on both countries to push ahead with reforms and threatened both with accession delays .

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .

the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .

european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .

the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .
some critics have said the 2006 world cup was turning into a stage for corporate sponsors rather than for the teams or the supporters .

the complaints came from european lawmakers who feel fans should not have to pay a fee just to enter the ticket lottery . they are not just the hottest tickets in town ; they are probably the hottest in the world .
the world cup is just seven months away and fans from around the globe - certainly more than the 2.93 million tickets available - are anxiously waiting to see whether they will receive one of the desired tickets .
the world soccer body fifa has hardly won friends amongst soccer supporters with its ticket sales practices since a lottery process for tickets started in february 2005 .
for the latest drawing , which has been underway since nov .
2 , fifa has been asking for a non-refundable fee of five euros -lrb- $ 6 -rrb- - just to get on the waiting list .
the practice of charging for a service - namely the sale of a ticket - that can not even be guaranteed did n't go unnoticed by european parliamentarians , including german liberal democrat otto graf lambsdorff .
he and his dutch peer toine manders complained , and now the european commission has decided to look into the matter .
" the issue has been brought to our attention , " commission competition spokesman jonathan todd told reporters .
" we do n't yet have any conclusions .
we are actively pursuing the matter . "
abuse of ticket monopoly bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not every soccer fan has gotten a kick out of the ticket ordering process potential spectators to games at the 12 venues around germany must pay the non-refundable fee as well as the full price of the tickets months ahead of the february 2006 draw .
should they lose the lottery , the ticket money will be refunded .
nevertheless , the length of time from payment to refund angers european lawmakers .
" this means that rejected applicants will not have access to their own money for several months , " toine manders told the associated press .
european parliamentarian andre brie , who had already brought the matter into the light at the beginning of november , described the charges as being like an interest-free loan for fifa .
" we never thought about making interest -lrb- off the money -rrb- , " said organizing committee vice president horst schmidt in response to brie 's charge .
ticket sales controversial from beginning fifa and the german organizing committee have been under fire almost since the time world cup tickets first started going on sale .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former interior minister otto schily implemented strict security measures for the world cup in order to guarantee the safety of the 64 games that will be played from june 9 to july 9 next year , fifa demanded basic personal information be included on tickets .
the measures were slammed by data protection groups .
the organizers also faced criticism over their lack of flexibility in allowing tickets to be transferred to others if the original ticket-holder decided not to go attend matches .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.11.2005 star chefs light up german sky großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christian bau : not just a star cook , but a three-star cook germany a gourmet paradise ?
do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .
the food , wine , decor and service will be exceptional and you should expect to pay highly for it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , germany 's " best cook " has a nearly perfect score with gault millau two more restaurants got two-star designation - meaning the the restaurant deserves a detour , everything will be top-notch , if not perfect , and again you should not expect a bargain - bringing the number in germany up to 15 .
and 161 restaurants carry one star - if it 's on your way , you should stop , and the restaurant should serve very good food in a pleasant environment .
that 's four more stars than in 2005 .
' red bible ' the red-colored michelin guide is considered the bible for those obsessed with fine cuisine , and it tends to favor french classic cooking over modern styles .
as much as it is revered , the system has come under criticism for carrying disproportional weight .
the awarding - or removal - of a star can make or break an establishment .
a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .
along with schloss berg 's christian bau , who got his third star , the country 's new two-star cooks are juan amador of amador in hessen and sven elverfeld from the restaurant aqua in wolfsburg , the town in lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarter is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cooks impress too in addition to giving out new stars , michelin also instituted a sort of " watch this space " notation for chefs who seem on the track to improvement .
some of them are awaiting their first stars ; others , like eric menchon of cologne 's le moissonier , are hoping for a second .
for food lovers , this precipitous rise in star gastronomy begs the question : what the heck is going on here ?
how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .
it ties the rise in restaurant stars to an attempt to pump up the waning financial fortunes of the german restaurant industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bühner 's la table has two michelin stars and 19 gault millau points for the past four years , german restaurants have published massive drops in sales , according to a recent story on foodie web site best-of-wine.com.
inflating the stars awarded is one way of generating interest .
the press release michelin gave out with its newest guide notes " new optimism after many businesses closed their doors and following hard years of competition in gastronomy and hotellery . "
yet , according to best-of-wine , the clearest sign of new optimism is the surge in star chefs .
" current polls show that christmas bookings are only a shadow of what they typically used to be , " the site wrote .
even if best-of-wine is right , and the proliferation of stars is a bit artificial , the news is n't all bad .
in the past decade , german cooking has undergone a renaissance .
restaurants no longer rely on sauerkraut , pork and potatoes - and the more stars its cooks are given , the more the world will be watching to see where german cuisine goes next . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders in a stew over culinary heritage french president jacques chirac flies into scotland on wednesday for the g8 summit after allegedly slamming british cuisine .

the us military saturday denied that it was running a guantanamo-style prison for terror suspects in kosovo , as tensions continued to simmer over reports of secret cia flights across europe . " there are no secret detention facilities located on camp bondsteel -lrb- eastern kosovo -rrb- , " major michael wunn , us military spokesman in kosovo , told news agency afp in reference to the us base as part of nato forces in the balkan province . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gil-robles -lrb- center -rrb- said he saw muslims being held at a guantanamo-like center in kosovo the major was responding to comments friday by council of europe human rights commissioner alvaro gil-robles , who claimed to have seen muslims being held at a facility in kosovo which looked like the guantanamo bay prison in cuba , used to house captives from the us-led " war on terror . "
gil-robles told france 's le monde newspaper he had been " shocked " by conditions at the center , which he said he witnessed in 2002 . major wunn said it was " common knowledge " that camp bondsteel included a detention facility used to house people detained during nato peacekeeping operations in the un-administered southern serbian province .
but he said it was currently empty and it was not used as a secret prison by the central intelligence agency . " the facility is operated by us military police soldiers fully trained in detention center operations .
currently , no one is detained in this facility , " he said .
" the facility is subject to inspection by the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- and is regularly inspected by the united states army , europe . "
washington under pressure the denial came as washington felt mounting european pressure to reveal the routes and activities of its cia prisoner flights amid concerns about human rights abuses and torture on european territory .
reports of cia plane touch-downs have come from countries as far apart as macedonia , finland and portugal in recent weeks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe often acts as a human rights watchdog the council of europe opened a probe this week , but top investigator dick marty , of switzerland , conceded saturday that he had " practically no methods of constraint " to stop the flights to change cia methods . the council 's member states have until feb .
21 to provide information to the inquiry , which will examine governments ' compliance with european human rights law and whether officials have been involved in " unacknowledged " detentions or transport of detainees . " the council of europe can not adopt specific measures against the united states , " marty told the times newspaper in geneva .
but he said washington could be made to feel an " international reproach " and explain itself before the united nations . european governments have expressed concern over reports that the cia flights could be used to transport prisoners , held without charge as " enemy combatants , " to secret torture sites outside us legal jurisdiction .
" those responsible must pay " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : javier solana european union foreign policy chief javier solana told spanish radio on saturday that europeans found any suggestion of torture " intolerable " and insisted that such reports be investigated . " i have no doubt that this will be the object of an investigation ...
it must be investigated and those responsible must pay , " he told cadena ser radio . meanwhile , turkish transport minister binali yildirim confirmed that a cia plane had " put down " at the sabiha gokcen airport in istanbul last week in order to refuel . " there was a landing requested for technical reasons .
its landing was authorized .
it was not carrying any passengers - only equipment was on board , " the minister was quoted as saying by the anatolia news agency .
" it filled its tanks with fuel and continued in its way , " he said , adding that when planes requested landings to refuel it was difficult to refuse them . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cia uses german bases to transport terrorists , paper says while the issue over secret cia prisons in europe continues to simmer , new allegations over undisclosed cia flights transporting suspected terrorists is pushing european officials to demand answers from washington .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .
the food , wine , decor and service will be exceptional and you should expect to pay highly for it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : harald wohlfahrt , germany 's " best cook " has a nearly perfect score with gault millau two more restaurants got two-star designation - meaning the the restaurant deserves a detour , everything will be top-notch , if not perfect , and again you should not expect a bargain - bringing the number in germany up to 15 .
and 161 restaurants carry one star - if it 's on your way , you should stop , and the restaurant should serve very good food in a pleasant environment .
that 's four more stars than in 2005 .
' red bible ' the red-colored michelin guide is considered the bible for those obsessed with fine cuisine , and it tends to favor french classic cooking over modern styles .
as much as it is revered , the system has come under criticism for carrying disproportional weight .
the awarding - or removal - of a star can make or break an establishment .
a restaurant that is given a star is virtually guaranteed a huge leap in patronage and profits ; the loss of stars - or likewise , points on competitor gault millau 's scale - can shut an establishment down .
along with schloss berg 's christian bau , who got his third star , the country 's new two-star cooks are juan amador of amador in hessen and sven elverfeld from the restaurant aqua in wolfsburg , the town in lower saxony where volkswagen 's headquarter is .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cooks impress too in addition to giving out new stars , michelin also instituted a sort of " watch this space " notation for chefs who seem on the track to improvement .
some of them are awaiting their first stars ; others , like eric menchon of cologne 's le moissonier , are hoping for a second .
for food lovers , this precipitous rise in star gastronomy begs the question : what the heck is going on here ?
how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .
it ties the rise in restaurant stars to an attempt to pump up the waning financial fortunes of the german restaurant industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas bühner 's la table has two michelin stars and 19 gault millau points for the past four years , german restaurants have published massive drops in sales , according to a recent story on foodie web site best-of-wine.com.
inflating the stars awarded is one way of generating interest .
the press release michelin gave out with its newest guide notes " new optimism after many businesses closed their doors and following hard years of competition in gastronomy and hotellery . "
yet , according to best-of-wine , the clearest sign of new optimism is the surge in star chefs .
" current polls show that christmas bookings are only a shadow of what they typically used to be , " the site wrote .
even if best-of-wine is right , and the proliferation of stars is a bit artificial , the news is n't all bad .
in the past decade , german cooking has undergone a renaissance .

do n't scoff - the land of sauerkraut and schnitzel is second only to france when it comes to michelin three-star restaurants . germany 's gastronomic firmament just got a little brighter .
the michelin restaurant guide for 2006 named a new three-star restaurant , bringing the total number in the country up to seven .
the award - to chef christian bau 's schloss berg in the town of perl , in saarland - leaves germany second only to france as the country with the most three-star restaurants .
in the michelin system , three stars means the restaurant deserves a special trip .

how is it that a nation known for serving large portions of hearty , rib-sticking fare that frequently revolves around pork and potatoes is close on the heels of the french , whose gastronomic tradition has set the world 's standard for refined cuisine ?
star inflation ?
the answer varies depending who you ask .
juliane caspar , the 35-year-old editor of the german michelin guide , told dpa press agency that the rise in star chefs reflects a change in german cooking .
" top cooks in germany have gotten more creative but can master classic cuisine , " she contends .
another answer sounds a bit more sinister , but may be more likely .

as the four-wheel-drive speeds through the night , its tyres screech , its body swerving from side to side .
the driver is pushing the car to the limit ; the speedometer reads well over 150km / h -lrb- 93mph -rrb- .
this is getting from a to b - the chechen way .
every now and again , the lexus brakes sharply , and the driver lowers his window to greet somebody barely visible in the dark .
" salaam aleikum ! "
" aleikum salaam , ramzan ! " comes the answer from a heavily-armed bearded man in american uniform . "
soon -lsb- chechnya -rsb- will be the safest place in the world - people will be coming here on holiday " ramzan kadyrov q & a : chechnya elections this is tsentoroy , the home village and headquarters of ramzan kadyrov , the most powerful man in today 's chechnya .
he is the republic 's acting prime minister - and its de facto ruler .
' invincible kadyrovtsy ' mr kadyrov is driving us to the barracks of his private army .
officially it is known as the anti-terrorism squad , but everyone refers to its soldiers as kadyrovtsy - " kadyrov 's guys " .
some of them are professional policemen ; some were trained as combat officers .
and quite a few - like ramzan kadyrov himself - are former rebels who fought the russians in the mid-1990s , but have since then changed sides .
as the car pulls up outside the army base , mr kadyrov whistles into the night .
from this moment , his soldiers only have 40 seconds to get ready for action .
thirty seconds later , they are already standing to attention , lined up and armed to the teeth .
" look at them , " says mr kadyrov .
" american uniforms , russian weapons , islamic beliefs and a chechen spirit .
they are invincible . "
shooting practice next morning , he proves that he means business .
we are taken to a firing range - where mr kadyrov 's soldiers demonstrate their ability to handle pistols , machine guns and grenades .
and their leader , the acting prime minister himself , does not waste any time either .
in front of his troops , ramzan kadyrov picks up a rocket-propelled grenade launcher , aims carefully , sticking out his tongue like a schoolchild - and hits the target some 100m away .
this army - and mr kadyrov himself - is what the kremlin is counting on to establish peace and stability in the troubled republic .
they are a living example of moscow 's " chechenisation " policy - they , not the russian federal forces , run today 's chechnya .
" we have made chechnya the safest place in russia , soon it 'll be the safest place in the world - people will be coming here on holiday .
" we 've just got a few more devils to kill and that 'll be it .
we want peace .
and if anyone does n't want to live in peace with us , we 'll make them , " promises mr kadyrov .
torture claims but human rights groups are less optimistic .
" ramzan does not stabilise the situation in chechnya .
he himself motivates supporters of the rebels by his activities , " says grigory shvedov , a journalist and human rights activist .
" the personal security forces of ramzan are the main group involved in torturing and abducting people - people are arrested and then no-one can find out where they have been or where their bodies are , " he says .
mr kadyrov himself categorically denies these accusations , while the kremlin seems to ignore them .
back at his home in tsentoroy , mr kadyrov treats us to some tea and biscuits .
on the wall opposite is a huge photograph of our host , taken at the kremlin .
the picture shows him waiting patiently as president vladimir putin attaches the hero of russia medal to his jacket .
kadyrov 's lion " do you want to see my pet lion ?
the one i received as a present when my baby son was born ? "
mr kadyrov asks us suddenly .
we rush outside , into the enormous front yard .
and there , in the corner , hiding behind a white caucasian sheepdog , sits a lion cub .
it looks confused - and rather scared .
but when mr kadyrov reaches out to pat it , the cub growls and bares its teeth , making sure the message is clear .
" one day i 'll teach it who the master is , " he says as he looks at his pet .
" this lion will either kill me - or learn to be obedient . "
so , for this budding lion trainer the choice is rather limited .
as it is for the republic he runs .
mr kadyrov has already won the upper hand here - now it is a question of whether his lightning-fast , sometimes unpredictable and often tough decisions , will bring the peace and stability which chechens need so badly .
if not , chechnya could slip back into chaos , spreading instability around the north caucasus .

he is the republic 's acting prime minister - and its de facto ruler .
' invincible kadyrovtsy ' mr kadyrov is driving us to the barracks of his private army .
officially it is known as the anti-terrorism squad , but everyone refers to its soldiers as kadyrovtsy - " kadyrov 's guys " .

thirty seconds later , they are already standing to attention , lined up and armed to the teeth .

" american uniforms , russian weapons , islamic beliefs and a chechen spirit .
they are invincible . "
shooting practice next morning , he proves that he means business .
mr kadyrov proudly demonstrated his shooting skills we are taken to a firing range - where mr kadyrov 's soldiers demonstrate their ability to handle pistols , machine guns and grenades .
and their leader , the acting prime minister himself , does not waste any time either .
in front of his troops , ramzan kadyrov picks up a rocket-propelled grenade launcher , aims carefully , sticking out his tongue like a schoolchild - and hits the target some 100m away .
this army - and mr kadyrov himself - is what the kremlin is counting on to establish peace and stability in the troubled republic .

as the four-wheel-drive speeds through the night , its tyres screech , its body swerving from side to side .
the driver is pushing the car to the limit ; the speedometer reads well over 150km / h -lrb- 93mph -rrb- .
this is getting from a to b - the chechen way .
every now and again , the lexus brakes sharply , and the driver lowers his window to greet somebody barely visible in the dark .
" salaam aleikum ! "
" aleikum salaam , ramzan ! " comes the answer from a heavily-armed bearded man in american uniform .
soon -lsb- chechnya -rsb- will be the safest place in the world - people will be coming here on holiday ramzan kadyrov q & a : chechnya elections this is tsentoroy , the home village and headquarters of ramzan kadyrov , the most powerful man in today 's chechnya .
he is the republic 's acting prime minister - and its de facto ruler .
' invincible kadyrovtsy ' mr kadyrov is driving us to the barracks of his private army .
officially it is known as the anti-terrorism squad , but everyone refers to its soldiers as kadyrovtsy - " kadyrov 's guys " .
grozny is patrolled by heavily armed men ahead of the poll some of them are professional policemen ; some were trained as combat officers .
and quite a few - like ramzan kadyrov himself - are former rebels who fought the russians in the mid-1990s , but have since then changed sides .
as the car pulls up outside the army base , mr kadyrov whistles into the night .
from this moment , his soldiers only have 40 seconds to get ready for action .
thirty seconds later , they are already standing to attention , lined up and armed to the teeth .
" look at them , " says mr kadyrov .
" american uniforms , russian weapons , islamic beliefs and a chechen spirit .
they are invincible . "
shooting practice next morning , he proves that he means business .
mr kadyrov proudly demonstrated his shooting skills we are taken to a firing range - where mr kadyrov 's soldiers demonstrate their ability to handle pistols , machine guns and grenades .
and their leader , the acting prime minister himself , does not waste any time either .
in front of his troops , ramzan kadyrov picks up a rocket-propelled grenade launcher , aims carefully , sticking out his tongue like a schoolchild - and hits the target some 100m away .
this army - and mr kadyrov himself - is what the kremlin is counting on to establish peace and stability in the troubled republic .
they are a living example of moscow 's " chechenisation " policy - they , not the russian federal forces , run today 's chechnya .
" we have made chechnya the safest place in russia , soon it 'll be the safest place in the world - people will be coming here on holiday .
" we 've just got a few more devils to kill and that 'll be it .
we want peace .
and if anyone does n't want to live in peace with us , we 'll make them , " promises mr kadyrov .
torture claims but human rights groups are less optimistic .
chechnya will be russia 's " safest place " , ramzan claims " ramzan does not stabilise the situation in chechnya .
he himself motivates supporters of the rebels by his activities , " says grigory shvedov , a journalist and human rights activist .
" the personal security forces of ramzan are the main group involved in torturing and abducting people - people are arrested and then no-one can find out where they have been or where their bodies are , " he says .
mr kadyrov himself categorically denies these accusations , while the kremlin seems to ignore them .
back at his home in tsentoroy , mr kadyrov treats us to some tea and biscuits .
on the wall opposite is a huge photograph of our host , taken at the kremlin .
the picture shows him waiting patiently as president vladimir putin attaches the hero of russia medal to his jacket .
kadyrov 's lion " do you want to see my pet lion ?
the one i received as a present when my baby son was born ? "
mr kadyrov asks us suddenly .
the pet lion shows it has a tough character , too we rush outside , into the enormous front yard .
and there , in the corner , hiding behind a white caucasian sheepdog , sits a lion cub .
it looks confused - and rather scared .
but when mr kadyrov reaches out to pat it , the cub growls and bares its teeth , making sure the message is clear .
" one day i 'll teach it who the master is , " he says as he looks at his pet .
" this lion will either kill me - or learn to be obedient . "
so , for this budding lion trainer the choice is rather limited .
as it is for the republic he runs .

the production came with a 250-strong company of dancers , musicians and technicians combining artistry and athleticism of the highest order .
huw tregelles williams , a board member of the wales millennium centre , said it had been a year full of memorable moments .
he remembers , " the urdd eisteddfod , the mark morris dance company - one of the best evenings i 've ever spent in the theatre - and then some very popular musicals such as miss saigon and thoroughly modern millie " .
almost a third of a million people have attended more than 250 performances at the donald gordon theatre and the wmc is on course to reach its target of 350,000 ticket sales by the new year .
australian ballet helped the wmc 's chief executive ' feel at home ' half a million people have visited the building which has established itself as both a tourist magnet and architectural icon , many enjoying the free concerts and performances in the foyer .
some of the attractions on the main stage would have been unfamiliar to many , such as the opening season 's visit by cirque eloize from montreal , with their production of " rain " .
the end of the performance , where dancers cavorted on a water-filled stage , showed off the technical possibilities of the space , while easily rivalling gene kelly .
almost a third of a million people have visited in the centre 's first year more traditional circus skills came in the form of circus oz , who , along with the australian ballet , made chief executive judith isherwood - who used to run the sydney opera house - feel more at home .
writer and critic mike smith assesses the first year as " a little bit like the building - a compromise that has largely worked " .
he 's enjoyed the kirov , mark morris and some of the operas that welsh national opera would n't have been able to stage were it not for the centre .
he 's also very much enjoyed some of the community productions by companies such as hijinx .
half a million people will have visited the centre by the end of the year , suggesting that the £ 103m wales millennium centre , once feared as another white elephant , is rather a genuine stage for the nation .

five zebra mussels have been found on the hull of a boat in kinnego marina .
the mussels affect lake ecology and the department of the environment wants to see if the lake has been colonised .
bob davison of the environment and heritage service said the boat had not been in any other lake such as lough erne where the mussel is established .
" no other zebra mussels have yet been seen in the lake , " he said .
" we have started an investigation into how widely they have colonised the lake .
we do not know if the mussels are confined to kinnego bay or if they are already present throughout the lough .
" we are very concerned that zebra mussels may be established in lough neagh .
" invasions of alien species are the biggest threat to native biodiversity after habitat destruction and the zebra mussel is ranked among the world 's 100 worst invasive species . "
zebra mussels first invaded ireland in 1994 and have spread rapidly throughout the shannon-erne waterway and connected navigable waterbodies .
in july , the doe expressed major concern that zebra mussel sightings have been confirmed in carran lough , derrygonnelly , which is not connected to the navigable shannon / erne system .
this was the first confirmed sighting of zebra mussels outside the erne navigation in northern ireland since they were discovered in lough erne in 1997 .
should a zebra mussel population become established in lough neagh there will be unpredictable implications for fish , birds , water abstraction , navigation , sand dredging and other interests , the doe said .
the zebra mussel is a stripy , freshwater mussel native to the caspian sea area of eastern europe .
they form large colonies that attach to almost any hard surface and have already affected private and public water abstraction stations on lough erne , resulting in modifications at the killyhevlin water treatment plant costing over £ 100,000 .

five zebra mussels have been found on the hull of a boat in kinnego marina .
the mussels affect lake ecology and the department of the environment wants to see if the lake has been colonised .
bob davison of the environment and heritage service said the boat had not been in any other lake such as lough erne where the mussel is established .
" no other zebra mussels have yet been seen in the lake , " he said .
" we have started an investigation into how widely they have colonised the lake .
we do not know if the mussels are confined to kinnego bay or if they are already present throughout the lough .
" we are very concerned that zebra mussels may be established in lough neagh .
" invasions of alien species are the biggest threat to native biodiversity after habitat destruction and the zebra mussel is ranked among the world 's 100 worst invasive species . "
zebra mussels first invaded ireland in 1994 and have spread rapidly throughout the shannon-erne waterway and connected navigable waterbodies .
in july , the doe expressed major concern that zebra mussel sightings have been confirmed in carran lough , derrygonnelly , which is not connected to the navigable shannon / erne system .
this was the first confirmed sighting of zebra mussels outside the erne navigation in northern ireland since they were discovered in lough erne in 1997 .
should a zebra mussel population become established in lough neagh there will be unpredictable implications for fish , birds , water abstraction , navigation , sand dredging and other interests , the doe said .
the zebra mussel is a stripy , freshwater mussel native to the caspian sea area of eastern europe .
they form large colonies that attach to almost any hard surface and have already affected private and public water abstraction stations on lough erne , resulting in modifications at the killyhevlin water treatment plant costing over £ 100,000 .

the probe , called hayabusa - japanese for " falcon " - briefly touched down on the itokawa asteroid and fired a projectile to loosen surface material .
scientists believe it collected the debris , but will only be sure when hayabusa returns to earth in 2007 .
moon rocks have been analysed before , but asteroids could contain material from the birth of the solar system .
scientists at the japan aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- confirmed that hayabusa touched down on itokawa for a few seconds .
hayabusa is designed to gather asteroid dust for return to earth touching down on the asteroid , which is 290 million km -lrb- 180 million miles -rrb- from earth , was as tough as landing a jumbo jet in the grand canyon , a jaxa spokesman added .
the probe fired a small metal ball into the surface and apparently collected the resulting powdery debris .
" the process of sampling also seems to have gone very well , " said jaxa 's kiyotaka yashiro .
japan 's science and technology minister iwao matsuda praised the effort .
" i am delighted to hear that it has collected the samples .
it is the world 's first such feat and it will contribute greatly to mankind 's exploration of space . "
celestial secrets saturday 's announcement by the japan aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- came after a series of problems with the spacecraft .
last sunday , hayabusa made a first touchdown on the rotating asteroid - but it failed to collect material after temporarily losing contact with earth .
a separate attempt to land a miniature robot on the asteroid was also unsuccessful .
hayabusa was launched in may 2003 and has until early december before it must leave orbit and begin its journey home .
it is expected to return to earth and land in the australian outback in june 2007 .
examining asteroid samples is expected to help unlock secrets of how celestial bodies were formed because their surfaces are believed to have remained relatively unchanged over the ages , unlike those of larger bodies such the planets or moons .
itokawa , named after the japanese rocket scientist hideo itokawa , is 690m -lrb- 2,300 ft -rrb- long and 300m -lrb- 1,000 ft -rrb- wide .

dyfed-powys police advised drivers in carmarthenshire and parts of pembrokeshire to travel only if their journey was essential on saturday .
the highways agency closed the a477 road to pembroke dock because of an accident on sheet ice .
gwent police also said some of the more remote roads in their area were icy and potentially dangerous .
it follows huge disruption on friday after heavy snow fell in a band across mid , south and west wales , forcing 460 schools to close and huge disruption on the roads .
a dyfed-powys police spokesman said officers have attended numerous incidents throughout carmarthenshire , where vehicles have skidded on black ice early on saturday morning .
heavier than expected snow fell across large parts of wales in one incident a lorry jack-knifed on the a40 between carmarthen and st clears .
police say gritting lorries have been out all night but they are not having any affect in carmarthenshire where black ice is causing major problems .
gwent police had to recover a vehicle from a mountain road between manmoel and cwm in blaenau gwent after it slid on black ice .
the a477 road in pembrokeshire has been closed between broadmoor and redberth until 1300 gmt on saturday .
four people were struck by lightning in the preseli mountains in pembrokeshire , in a thunderstorm following friday 's snow .
one was transferred by helicopter to morriston hospital in swansea while the three others were later discharged from hospital .
forecasters admitted that snow in south and east wales early on friday was heavier than predicted .
reports on thursday suggested north and west wales would be worst hit , with other areas receiving a light dusting of snow .
bbc wales weatherman derek brockway said : " there was certainly more snow in the vale of glamorgan , the valleys and cardiff than i thought there would be .
" but the met office had been warning of snow all week and had issued an early warning , so no-one should have been caught unawares . "
a change in wind direction was probably to blame for the extra snow , mr brockway said , adding that no forecast could be 100 % accurate .
both rhondda cynon taf and bridgend councils said the snow had been worse than expected , but defended their responses in the face of criticism from one bus company .
shamrock coaches suspended its services in bridgend , the vale of glamorgan and the valleys claiming roads had not been gritted .
the company said it could not get buses out of depots .
rhondda cynon taf council said all roads had been salted by 0200 gmt on friday .
but a statement added : " it appears that most snow fell after this time and we are now addressing the many problems this has caused by deploying all available resources including staff from other service areas . "
bridgend council said the claim that roads had not been gritted was simply not correct .
" precautionary salting was already carried out yesterday in anticipation of the forecasted light snowfall , but our response increased as the snow became heavier , " the council said .

but a statement added : " it appears that most snow fell after this time and we are now addressing the many problems this has caused by deploying all available resources including staff from other service areas . "
bridgend council said the claim that roads had not been gritted was simply not correct .
" precautionary salting was already carried out yesterday in anticipation of the forecasted light snowfall , but our response increased as the snow became heavier , " the council said .

the probe , called hayabusa - japanese for " falcon " - briefly touched down on the itokawa asteroid and fired a projectile to loosen surface material .
scientists believe it collected the debris , but will only be sure when hayabusa returns to earth in 2007 .
moon rocks have been analysed before , but asteroids could contain material from the birth of the solar system .
scientists at the japan aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- confirmed that hayabusa touched down on itokawa for a few seconds .
touching down on the asteroid , which is 290 million km -lrb- 180 million miles -rrb- from earth , was as tough as landing a jumbo jet in the grand canyon , a jaxa spokesman added .
the probe fired a small metal ball into the surface and apparently collected the resulting powdery debris .
" the process of sampling also seems to have gone very well , " said jaxa 's kiyotaka yashiro .
japan 's science and technology minister iwao matsuda praised the effort .
" i am delighted to hear that it has collected the samples .
it is the world 's first such feat and it will contribute greatly to mankind 's exploration of space . "
celestial secrets saturday 's announcement by the japan aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- came after a series of problems with the spacecraft .
last sunday , hayabusa made a first touchdown on the rotating asteroid - but it failed to collect material after temporarily losing contact with earth .
a separate attempt to land a miniature robot on the asteroid was also unsuccessful .
hayabusa was launched in may 2003 and has until early december before it must leave orbit and begin its journey home .
it is expected to return to earth and land in the australian outback in june 2007 .
examining asteroid samples is expected to help unlock secrets of how celestial bodies were formed because their surfaces are believed to have remained relatively unchanged over the ages , unlike those of larger bodies such the planets or moons .
itokawa , named after the japanese rocket scientist hideo itokawa , is 690m -lrb- 2,300 ft -rrb- long and 300m -lrb- 1,000 ft -rrb- wide .

some of roshinara begum 's customers use the service to keep in touch with loved ones far away .

' win-win ' grameen has given loans to 180,000 telephone ladies so far , and 10,000 more are being signed up each month .
the key to the success of the scheme is that it is not charity - every month grameen gets $ 10m in revenue .
" this is a good business , for the grameen phone and a good business for the rural women , poor women , grameen bank borrowers , " says dipal chandra barua , the deputy managing director of grameen bank .
