the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .
the emirate of dubai , which is eager to remake itself into a global banking center , is likely to soon look more attractive to many in europe . kyle james , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates tax breaks for fat cats germany 's highly-paid corporate executives could find themselves the lucky recipients of tax breaks if the state government of hesse gets its way .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .
" but he certainly would not have to be exactly like him .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .

" we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .

a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .

" we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .

" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2005 what is iran 's nuclear program really for ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is only for civilian purposes iranian president chatami met with french president chirac tuesday to discuss iran 's nuclear program , among other things .
dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .

austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .
" but he certainly would not have to be exactly like him .
i am hoping for a pope who ’ s more open towards reform .
and one who grants women more rights within the catholic church and responds more flexibly to a fast-changing social environment in the age of globalization . " hoping for a progressive successor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant churches allow women to become priests thierse 's view is shared by greens politician christa nickels , who is also a member of the central committee of german catholics .
she argued that the common practice of allowing only men become priests is no longer acceptable .
nickels also said she hopes for a more progressive stance in the catholic church on sexuality and contraception . nickels said that family planning through contraception can ’ t be likened to the destruction of life and adds that speaking out against the use of condoms means ignoring the threat of the hiv epidemic . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life at odds with the germans pope john paul ii 's only travel abroad this year was supposed to be to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.04.2005 cracking down on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax office wants to reel in some of the billions in unpaid taxes as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.04.2005 cracking down on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax office wants to reel in some of the billions in unpaid taxes as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since forming a coalition with the conservative people 's party of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , however , the freedom party has been hit by crises and seen its popularity plummet . gaining distance from extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party is an attempt by haider to re-establish himself and re-invent himself as a moderate politician , distancing himself from extremists in the freedom party who had grown increasingly critical .
details of the new party policy are sketchy but haider told journalists he wants to continue the work of the current government . " we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .
but most senior freedom party members of the current government team appear to be aligning themselves with haider . the vice chancellor and transport minister hubert gorbach along with the social affairs minister ursula haubner and a number of other senior figures have made their loyalty clear . working relationship ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel crucially , chancellor wolfgang schüssel says he 's prepared to work with the new party .
" it certainly seems possible , " he said .
" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.04.2005 cracking down on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax office wants to reel in some of the billions in unpaid taxes as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2005 what is iran 's nuclear program really for ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is only for civilian purposes iranian president chatami met with french president chirac tuesday to discuss iran 's nuclear program , among other things .
dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2005 what is iran 's nuclear program really for ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is only for civilian purposes iranian president chatami met with french president chirac tuesday to discuss iran 's nuclear program , among other things .
dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out .
-lrb- march 31 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : carrot and stick for iran while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp .
-lrb- march 13 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”

11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .

bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since forming a coalition with the conservative people 's party of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , however , the freedom party has been hit by crises and seen its popularity plummet . gaining distance from extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party is an attempt by haider to re-establish himself and re-invent himself as a moderate politician , distancing himself from extremists in the freedom party who had grown increasingly critical .
details of the new party policy are sketchy but haider told journalists he wants to continue the work of the current government . " we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .

" it certainly seems possible , " he said .
" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .
" but he certainly would not have to be exactly like him .
i am hoping for a pope who ’ s more open towards reform .
and one who grants women more rights within the catholic church and responds more flexibly to a fast-changing social environment in the age of globalization . " hoping for a progressive successor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant churches allow women to become priests thierse 's view is shared by greens politician christa nickels , who is also a member of the central committee of german catholics .
she argued that the common practice of allowing only men become priests is no longer acceptable .
nickels also said she hopes for a more progressive stance in the catholic church on sexuality and contraception . nickels said that family planning through contraception can ’ t be likened to the destruction of life and adds that speaking out against the use of condoms means ignoring the threat of the hiv epidemic . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life at odds with the germans pope john paul ii 's only travel abroad this year was supposed to be to germany .

" the date - exactly one month away - had been widely anticipated for a number of weeks , although it was announced 24 hours later than expected in the aftermath of saturday 's death of pope john paul ii . labor losing lead bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's houses of parliament labor is expected to be returned to power , but a fresh crop of opinion polls on tuesday indicated that it was losing its lead on the main opposition conservatives , with the liberal democrats well back in third place . " from now until may 5 , i and my colleagues will be out every day , in every part of britain , talking to the british people about our driving mission for a third term , " said blair , who turns 52 on may 6 . he said labor , in power since may 1997 , wanted " to build on the progress made , to accelerate the changes , to widen still further the opportunities available to the british people . " a fundamental choice ? in a swipe at the conservatives , he said the election would be a choice between consolidating the reforms that labor has put in place , or a return to a time of uncertainty and instability . " it 's a big choice , a fundamental choice , and there 's a lot at stake , " blair said , adding : " our mission will be driven by values . " one of the opinion polls tuesday , in the financial times newspaper , put the conservatives five points ahead of labor at 39 percent .
the others showed labor still in the lead , but only by two to six points . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael howard " beware yet another election where mr blair says one thing to get your vote on polling day and does something quite different afterwards , " tory leader michael howard -lrb- photo -rrb- told a party rally in london .
" mr blair is already secretly grinning at the prospect of his third victory .
well , you do n't have to settle for that . " with polling day now fixed , the house of commons will have until the end of the week to push through the remaining legislation on its agenda , before the politicians hit the campaign trail in earnest . blair as statesman a labor victory would clear the way for blair to play the role of international statesman for the remainder of this year , as he hosts the group of eight summit in gleneagles , scotland in june .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?

plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .

at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .

at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .
" but he certainly would not have to be exactly like him .
i am hoping for a pope who ’ s more open towards reform .
and one who grants women more rights within the catholic church and responds more flexibly to a fast-changing social environment in the age of globalization . " hoping for a progressive successor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant churches allow women to become priests thierse 's view is shared by greens politician christa nickels , who is also a member of the central committee of german catholics .
she argued that the common practice of allowing only men become priests is no longer acceptable .
nickels also said she hopes for a more progressive stance in the catholic church on sexuality and contraception . nickels said that family planning through contraception can ’ t be likened to the destruction of life and adds that speaking out against the use of condoms means ignoring the threat of the hiv epidemic . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life at odds with the germans pope john paul ii 's only travel abroad this year was supposed to be to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.04.2005 cracking down on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax office wants to reel in some of the billions in unpaid taxes as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .
" but he certainly would not have to be exactly like him .
i am hoping for a pope who ’ s more open towards reform .
and one who grants women more rights within the catholic church and responds more flexibly to a fast-changing social environment in the age of globalization . " hoping for a progressive successor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant churches allow women to become priests thierse 's view is shared by greens politician christa nickels , who is also a member of the central committee of german catholics .
she argued that the common practice of allowing only men become priests is no longer acceptable .
nickels also said she hopes for a more progressive stance in the catholic church on sexuality and contraception . nickels said that family planning through contraception can ’ t be likened to the destruction of life and adds that speaking out against the use of condoms means ignoring the threat of the hiv epidemic . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life at odds with the germans pope john paul ii 's only travel abroad this year was supposed to be to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.04.2005 what is iran 's nuclear program really for ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran insists its nuclear program is only for civilian purposes iranian president chatami met with french president chirac tuesday to discuss iran 's nuclear program , among other things .
dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out .
-lrb- march 31 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : carrot and stick for iran while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since forming a coalition with the conservative people 's party of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , however , the freedom party has been hit by crises and seen its popularity plummet . gaining distance from extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party is an attempt by haider to re-establish himself and re-invent himself as a moderate politician , distancing himself from extremists in the freedom party who had grown increasingly critical .
details of the new party policy are sketchy but haider told journalists he wants to continue the work of the current government . " we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .
but most senior freedom party members of the current government team appear to be aligning themselves with haider . the vice chancellor and transport minister hubert gorbach along with the social affairs minister ursula haubner and a number of other senior figures have made their loyalty clear . working relationship ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel crucially , chancellor wolfgang schüssel says he 's prepared to work with the new party .
" it certainly seems possible , " he said .
" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

since forming a coalition with the conservative people 's party of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , however , the freedom party has been hit by crises and seen its popularity plummet . gaining distance from extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party is an attempt by haider to re-establish himself and re-invent himself as a moderate politician , distancing himself from extremists in the freedom party who had grown increasingly critical .
details of the new party policy are sketchy but haider told journalists he wants to continue the work of the current government . " we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .
but most senior freedom party members of the current government team appear to be aligning themselves with haider . the vice chancellor and transport minister hubert gorbach along with the social affairs minister ursula haubner and a number of other senior figures have made their loyalty clear . working relationship ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel crucially , chancellor wolfgang schüssel says he 's prepared to work with the new party .
" it certainly seems possible , " he said .
" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

" when i was in germany , before the pope 's death , i wrote him a letter , asking him to convert to islam , " kaplan told the court .
the prosecutor in the case against kaplan sought life imprisonment for him on monday , accusing him of trying to forcefully overthrow turkey 's secular political system .
among the charges against kaplan , leader of the cologne-based extremist group known as the caliphate state - is an alleged 1988 bid to use an explosives-laden plane to blow up the mausoleum in ankara of mustafa kemal ataturk .
lawyers for kaplan , on the second day of his trial that opened in turkey in december , denied there was a bid to bomb the mausoleum , and called on the court to act in accordance with judicial practice in the european union , which turkey is seeking to join , and free his client on parole .
the court threw out the request and adjourned the trial to may 30 . dw-world.de " caliph of cologne " trial postponed the trial of metin kaplan on monday was postponed until april pending reform of turkey 's legal system .
turkish state prosecutors are accusing him of trying to overthrow the turkish government .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?
eu diplomats say they have not ruled it out .
-lrb- march 31 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : carrot and stick for iran while the us is willing to offer economic incentives to iran , the eu said it will take tehran to the un security council over its nuclear program if need be .
the join strategy wo n't help much , says dw 's peter philipp .
-lrb- march 13 , 2005 -rrb- us , europe agree on approach with iran the us and europe have agreed an approach in negotiating with iran over its nuclear program , with washington to offer modest economic incentives and europe to take the issue to the un security council if all else fails .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.04.2005 -pipe- 11:00 utc prosecutors want new mannesmann trial federal prosecutors in germany threw their weight on tuesday behind the appeal against the acquittal of top-ranking corporate executives , including deutsche bank chief josef ackermann , in the so-called mannesmann trial .
chief federal prosecutor kay nehm has filed an appeal against the not-guilty verdict of a court in düsseldorf last july , the federal prosecutors said , confirming a corresponding report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
at the time , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five others were cleared of wrongdoing in the multi-billion-euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- takeover of german telecommunications firm mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
state prosecutors had already lodged an appeal with germany 's highest court , the federal supreme court in karlsruhe .
in the high-profile corporate trial , ackermann and five other top executives were found not guilty of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago . dw-world.de prosecution appeals mannesmann verdict after a german judge acquitted all defendants of charges of breach of trust in the mannesmann trial , prosecutors said friday they would appeal the decision .
politicians meanwhile mulled legislative consequences .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .
at the moment , there 's no real perspective in this matter . dr. oliver thränert is head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin . martin schrader interviewed oliver thränert -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu mulls compromise with iran are france , britain and germany considering a compromise that would allow iran to continue some of its nuclear activities while angering the us ?

chief federal prosecutor kay nehm has filed an appeal against the not-guilty verdict of a court in düsseldorf last july , the federal prosecutors said , confirming a corresponding report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
at the time , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five others were cleared of wrongdoing in the multi-billion-euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- takeover of german telecommunications firm mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
state prosecutors had already lodged an appeal with germany 's highest court , the federal supreme court in karlsruhe .
in the high-profile corporate trial , ackermann and five other top executives were found not guilty of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago . dw-world.de prosecution appeals mannesmann verdict after a german judge acquitted all defendants of charges of breach of trust in the mannesmann trial , prosecutors said friday they would appeal the decision .
politicians meanwhile mulled legislative consequences .

chief federal prosecutor kay nehm has filed an appeal against the not-guilty verdict of a court in düsseldorf last july , the federal prosecutors said , confirming a corresponding report in the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
at the time , deutsche bank chairman josef ackermann and five others were cleared of wrongdoing in the multi-billion-euro -lrb- dollar -rrb- takeover of german telecommunications firm mannesmann by british mobile phone giant vodafone in 2000 .
state prosecutors had already lodged an appeal with germany 's highest court , the federal supreme court in karlsruhe .
in the high-profile corporate trial , ackermann and five other top executives were found not guilty of charges of breach of fiduciary duty when they rubber-stamped multi-million-euro golden handshakes to managers at the end of the fierce mannesmann-vodafone takeover battle four years ago . dw-world.de prosecution appeals mannesmann verdict after a german judge acquitted all defendants of charges of breach of trust in the mannesmann trial , prosecutors said friday they would appeal the decision .
politicians meanwhile mulled legislative consequences .

dw-world spoke to security expert oliver thränert about it . dw-world : does iran have the ability to build a nuclear bomb ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oliver thränert , head of the security policy research unit at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- in berlin oliver thränert : iran is creating the prerequisites by building a uranium enrichment facility in natans .
enriching uranium is one avenue to building a nuclear weapon .
at the same time , they are building a heavy water reactor from which they could produce plutonium .
plutonium is the second avenue to build such a bomb .
iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .
on the one side , the iranians would gain a lot , also economically , from a compromise .
on the other side , there are these security concerns , which again have to do with america .

iran declares both developmental steps as a civilian undertaking , which , the europeans and the americans for different reasons have doubts about . what are the europeans doing to dissuade the iranians from their nuclear program ? the europeans and the americans do n't want to cut off the iranians entirely from using nuclear technologies .
rather , they want to allow them to continue to use light water reactors , for example .
the europeans would even be prepared to sell a light water reactor -lrb- a nuclear power plant -rrb- , if iran would agree to do without heavy water technology , which in view of its military uses , is very dangerous . what is the european union 's aim in its talks with iran ? in any case the issue is to convince iran to stop anything that could lead to a complete nuclear fuel cycle , that is , to independent uranium enrichment .
it is a very dangerous technology which at the moment only 10 countries possess - and most of them also have nuclear weapons .
if you have the technology in the first place , you can use such facilities to enrich uranium by 5 percent and thus build fuel rods for reactors - or you enrich it up to 90 percent and use it to produce nuclear weapons .
one and the same facility can - without much constructional alteration - be used for civilian and military purposes . if iran is not satisfied with light water reactors , is it fair to assume that they are pursuing aims other than civilian ones ? the iranians argue that they want to be independent .
if you operate reactors but ca n't produce your own fuel rods you 're dependent on others .
and they say they often ca n't rely on their trade and cooperation partners .
also , after the islamic revolution in 1979 , the company siemens stopped construction of a reactor .
a certain amount of fear of isolation on the part of the iranian elite plays a role here .
on the other hand , the facility 's size and the fact that there 's no connection between it and the building schedule for reactors suggests that is really an enrichment facility for military purposes . the various positions appear incompatible .
how can a solution be found ? to start with , we 'll have to wait for the iranian presidential election in june , since the nuclear question naturally plays a role in the election campaigns too : nobody wants to be the one to give in to western demands .
i could imagine that if rafsanjani is elected a solution could be found .
he 's a centrist , a representative of the iranian trade bourgeoisie , and interested in improved trade relations - with europe above all .
at the same time , he has the chance to establish a broad basis to reach a compromise with the europeans . the head of the international atomic energy agency , elbaradei , said the us would have to provide iran with a security guarantee for the country to give way on the nuclear issue .
how do you see the role of the us ? the us has changed its position since president bush 's visit to europe and clearly declared at the highest level that they back the europeans in their efforts .
they have gone so far as to say that iran could be accepted in the world trade organization and the us would abstain from vetoing them there .
i do n't believe the us would express a security guarantee .
i think that will be the sticking point in the end .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”

" but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .

bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since forming a coalition with the conservative people 's party of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , however , the freedom party has been hit by crises and seen its popularity plummet . gaining distance from extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party is an attempt by haider to re-establish himself and re-invent himself as a moderate politician , distancing himself from extremists in the freedom party who had grown increasingly critical .
details of the new party policy are sketchy but haider told journalists he wants to continue the work of the current government . " we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .
but most senior freedom party members of the current government team appear to be aligning themselves with haider . the vice chancellor and transport minister hubert gorbach along with the social affairs minister ursula haubner and a number of other senior figures have made their loyalty clear . working relationship ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel crucially , chancellor wolfgang schüssel says he 's prepared to work with the new party .
" it certainly seems possible , " he said .
" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .

" hoping for a progressive successor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant churches allow women to become priests thierse 's view is shared by greens politician christa nickels , who is also a member of the central committee of german catholics .
she argued that the common practice of allowing only men become priests is no longer acceptable .
nickels also said she hopes for a more progressive stance in the catholic church on sexuality and contraception . nickels said that family planning through contraception can ’ t be likened to the destruction of life and adds that speaking out against the use of condoms means ignoring the threat of the hiv epidemic . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life at odds with the germans pope john paul ii 's only travel abroad this year was supposed to be to germany .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .

" we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.04.2005 cracking down on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax office wants to reel in some of the billions in unpaid taxes as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .

" but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .

bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 05.04.2005 cracking down on tax evaders großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax office wants to reel in some of the billions in unpaid taxes as of april 1st , a new “ law for tax honesty ” went into effect in germany aimed at fighting tax evasion .
the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .
" but he certainly would not have to be exactly like him .
i am hoping for a pope who ’ s more open towards reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.04.2005 the latest incarnation of jörg haider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politician formerly known to some as a xenophobic populist once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician . jörg haider , the former leader of austria 's once powerful freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- , announced on monday that he will lead a new political movement .
the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since forming a coalition with the conservative people 's party of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , however , the freedom party has been hit by crises and seen its popularity plummet . gaining distance from extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party is an attempt by haider to re-establish himself and re-invent himself as a moderate politician , distancing himself from extremists in the freedom party who had grown increasingly critical .
details of the new party policy are sketchy but haider told journalists he wants to continue the work of the current government . " we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .
but most senior freedom party members of the current government team appear to be aligning themselves with haider . the vice chancellor and transport minister hubert gorbach along with the social affairs minister ursula haubner and a number of other senior figures have made their loyalty clear . working relationship ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel crucially , chancellor wolfgang schüssel says he 's prepared to work with the new party .
" it certainly seems possible , " he said .
" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

many expect the successor to be more open to reform . while the huge merits of the late pope are not being questioned by anyone here , people do remember the sometimes rather strained relationship between the polish-born holy father and germany . in a country where christians are split equally into catholics and protestants it ’ s not really surprising that many are highly critical of the late pope ’ s lack of concrete support for ecumenicalism . fortifying border lines bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang huber -lrb- right -rrb- with cardinal karl lehmann , the head of the german catholic bishop 's conference , during an ecumenical memorial service for tsunami victims in january the head of the protestant church council in germany , wolfgang huber , said much more could have been done over the past 26 years to bring the two confessions closer together . " the pope pursued a policy of fortifying border lines between the christian denominations rather than showing a way of bringing catholics and protestants closer together , " he said .
he had a very clear stance on this , and we simply had to accept it . " huber recalled that the pope refused on theological grounds to allow catholic priests and protestant pastors to celebrate communion , or eucharist , jointly . " the pope 's stance was not really conducive to harmony between christian churches in germany , europe and the united states , " he said .
" in germany this was felt to be a particular problem , considering the huge number of cross-confessional marriages .
for the people who are affected , there has always been a great desire to celebrate communion together - something that we protestants have welcomed all along , but was rejected by the pope . " germans struggle with pope relations between the vatican and german catholic leaders have not been free of friction either .
in 2001 , john paul ii sent a letter to the german catholic church criticizing incidents in the liturgy , sermons and the conduct of the parishes here . it reflected the german catholics ’ permanent struggle between displaying loyalty to the pope and the desire to adapt their religion to modern times . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang thierse -lrb- right -rrb- during an earlier interview with dw-world 's ibrahim mohamad " it ’ ll be hard for any successor to match john paul ii ’ s charisma and influence , " said wolfgang thierse , a social democrat , catholic and the speaker of germany 's parliament .
" but he certainly would not have to be exactly like him .
i am hoping for a pope who ’ s more open towards reform .
and one who grants women more rights within the catholic church and responds more flexibly to a fast-changing social environment in the age of globalization . " hoping for a progressive successor bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant churches allow women to become priests thierse 's view is shared by greens politician christa nickels , who is also a member of the central committee of german catholics .
she argued that the common practice of allowing only men become priests is no longer acceptable .
nickels also said she hopes for a more progressive stance in the catholic church on sexuality and contraception . nickels said that family planning through contraception can ’ t be likened to the destruction of life and adds that speaking out against the use of condoms means ignoring the threat of the hiv epidemic . hardy graupner -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a life at odds with the germans pope john paul ii 's only travel abroad this year was supposed to be to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 05.04.2005 the latest incarnation of jörg haider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the politician formerly known to some as a xenophobic populist once a reviled far-right leader whose policies threatened austria 's position within europe , jörg haider announced on monday his return to the political scene in the form of a more moderate conservative politician . jörg haider , the former leader of austria 's once powerful freedom party -lrb- fpö -rrb- , announced on monday that he will lead a new political movement .
the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since forming a coalition with the conservative people 's party of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , however , the freedom party has been hit by crises and seen its popularity plummet . gaining distance from extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party is an attempt by haider to re-establish himself and re-invent himself as a moderate politician , distancing himself from extremists in the freedom party who had grown increasingly critical .
details of the new party policy are sketchy but haider told journalists he wants to continue the work of the current government . " we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .
but most senior freedom party members of the current government team appear to be aligning themselves with haider . the vice chancellor and transport minister hubert gorbach along with the social affairs minister ursula haubner and a number of other senior figures have made their loyalty clear . working relationship ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel crucially , chancellor wolfgang schüssel says he 's prepared to work with the new party .
" it certainly seems possible , " he said .
" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .
considered hard to control , haider 's xenophobic outbursts riled the european union so much that it slapped six months of sanctions on austria in 2000 after the fpö entered the national government .
since forming a coalition with the conservative people 's party of chancellor wolfgang schüssel , however , the freedom party has been hit by crises and seen its popularity plummet . gaining distance from extremists bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new party is an attempt by haider to re-establish himself and re-invent himself as a moderate politician , distancing himself from extremists in the freedom party who had grown increasingly critical .
details of the new party policy are sketchy but haider told journalists he wants to continue the work of the current government . " we want to fulfill the positive ideas of the freedom party 's program , without any destruction by anybody , and be responsible to the austrian people as a political party which stands in the government , " haider announced . it 's still unclear how many members of the old freedom party will join the new alliance .
but most senior freedom party members of the current government team appear to be aligning themselves with haider . the vice chancellor and transport minister hubert gorbach along with the social affairs minister ursula haubner and a number of other senior figures have made their loyalty clear . working relationship ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel crucially , chancellor wolfgang schüssel says he 's prepared to work with the new party .
" it certainly seems possible , " he said .
" we will consider the possibilities but yes it can work . " but the chancellor said he would neither exclude nor confirm the possibility of a new election .
a meeting with austrian president heinz fischer has been scheduled for tuesday and this could determine the future of the government . what seems clear is that the old freedom party has split into two distinct groups : the new alliance for the future - a moderate group lead by jörg haider , and the old freedom party which is likely to be led by a member of the far right , and which will continue to espouse a hard line on issues such as immigration and asylum . kerry skyring -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right austrian wins re-election austria 's outspoken nationalist jörg haider looks set to return to national prominence after winning a tough reelection as governor in the state of carinthia on sunday .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .
the amnesty program , which ended on march 31 , brought in 1.2 billion euros according to the government ; a substantial amount , but far below the five million euros that finance minister hans eichel had predicted . step two as that program ended , what might be called the second phase of the hunt for missing taxes went into effect , the “ law for tax honesty . ”
it allows investigators , such as those working for tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies to access some information regarding germans ’ bank accounts if they suspect income is not being reported . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bank statements from postbank .
they are n't open to investigators under the new law .
a customer ’ s name , birth date and the date the account was opened will be available to investigators , although account activity will not be disclosed .
before april 1 , such information could only be obtained by germany ’ s financial regulator bafin under a law that was designed to detect money laundering in the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks . there has been both praise and criticism of the new law , with those not in favor claiming it is an infringement on privacy , weakens germany ’ s status as a financial center and hurts germany ’ s banking secrecy laws . " but the question is , do i need bank secrecy regarding the tax authorities ?
what is being done now , in my opinion , is relatively mild , " said wolfram scheffler , a professor specializing in tax theory at friedrich-alexander university at erlangen-nuremberg . " as long as the constitutional court says that earned interest is to be taxed , then the law must go along , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : others say the strategy itself is off the mark and that allowing officials access to banking details is not going to refill tax coffers . “ it ’ s simply not necessary , ” said hans-ulrich liebern , head of the taxation department at the federation of tax payers in north rhine-westphalia .
“ if we would change the tax structure when it comes to capital gains and introduce a 15 percent compensation tax like is done in other countries , the tax offices wouldn ’ t need to go sniffing around in people ’ s business . ” eu tightens noose , but not completely the european union , with pressure from germany , is also turning up the pressure on tax cheats .
starting on july 1 , banks in 22 member countries , including germany , will have to share information on bank accounts opened and used by non-residents .
a withholding tax on interest income will automatically be forwarded to the account holder ’ s home country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria : insurmountable mountains , insurmountable bank secrecy laws but not all countries are participating , including luxembourg , belgium and - the country some fear will become the new switzerland when it comes to banking - austria . experts say austrian banks are profiting from the change in german banking laws , and austrian banks , particularly those along the german border , are expecting a rush from germans unhappy that their accounts at home have become more transparent . hans schinwald of the raiffeisen banking group in salzburg , told the financial times deutschland that he expects some 500 million euros to go to austria in the next few months .
bank secrecy is safe there , having been written into the country ’ s constitution . although the eu is well aware of austria ’ s banking secrecy laws and the temptation they present to potential tax evaders , brussels was not able to convince vienna to part ways with its cherished financial tradition .
a compromise was found in which austrian banks , as of july 1 , will withhold taxes from capital gains -lrb- 15 percent until 2008 -rrb- and automatically forward them to the bank account holder ’ s country of origin .
the account holder , however , will remain anonymous . but will it work ? despite the new laws , regulations and compromises , there are those who doubt that much can be done about tax evaders , especially the hard-core ones .
the new laws might hinder the small fish who “ forget ” to report that stock dividend or other extra income .
but for the persistent enemies of the taxman - who usually know the ins and outs of international financial law - there is little that these new regulations will achieve , according to nuremberg university ’ s scheffler . " money is bashful and many don ’ t want to report their earned interest , ” he said .
“ they will naturally look for a country where this money doesn ’ t have to be reported to the tax authorities . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : modern office skyscrapers of dubai that country will almost certainly be outside of europe .

the eu will follow with its own regulations this summer .
but experts wonder if the strategies will work . numbers are hard to come by when it comes to tax evasion .
its very nature precludes much reporting and the best the authorities can do is provide rough estimates .
the german government says the sums are in the billions every year .
the federal audit court has cited a 2003 report that estimated the state loses some 12 billion euros -lrb- $ 15.4 billion -rrb- a year just in sales tax manipulation within european union member countries . reports about prominent tax evaders hit the headlines in germany regularly .
one of the highest-profile cases was that of former tennis pro boris becker , who was fined 500,000 euros in 2002 for being stingy with the taxman . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker : tax evader he admitted to having a german residence in the 1990s while claiming to live in monaco , which is a tax haven . since high unemployment , a stagnant economy and high payouts from government welfare programs have combined to drain germany ’ s coffers to dangerously low levels , the government has a strong motivation to find those who hide substantial amounts of their income or capital gains from the taxman . the great tax hunt began back in january 2004 , when the government introduced a tax amnesty that ran for 15 months .
in 2004 , tax evaders could come clean and pay a flat 25 percent tax on their unreported income .
in the first three months of 2005 , that rate went up to 35 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finance minister hans eichel thought the tax amnesty would have brought in more .

the new party hopes to take the place of the freedom party in austria 's coalition government and means the effective spilt of haider 's notorious former party . after weeks of internal division and rumors of a split , jörg haider finally made it official .
at a hastily called press conference , the controversial austrian politician renounced his old party and said he would lead a new movement called the alliance for the future of austria . at the same time his sister , ursula haubner , who had been leading the party at the federal level , announced her immediate resignation from that position .
austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .

austria 's freedom party , under jörg haider , was once europe 's most successful far right group , winning more than a quarter of the vote in national elections five years ago .

more than 10,000 people are taking part in the five-day exercise , which also involves canada and the uk .
a simulated biological attack by terrorists in new jersey on monday coincided with a mock chemical attack at a port on the coast of connecticut .
on tuesday , the focus of the exercise will shift to hospitals .
" the point of this is not to design a simulation that makes us ' look good ' because we were able to figure out how to pre-package everything that we wanted to do , " us homeland security secretary michael chertoff said .
" the point is to actually drive at the areas where we think there are potential questions or criticisms , to really push there in order to learn more lessons . "
although no real weapons or biological agents are used , federal and local officials as well as emergency services respond as if it is the real thing .
flu-like symptoms witnesses describe police and emergency workers moving tentatively towards a blazing car on a university campus in new jersey .
a hose pipe is spotted hanging out of a rear window and a commercial sprayer lies nearby , presumably used to disperse the fake biological agent .
in pictures : us terror drill the police commander orders caution and the deployment of biological suits .
people flee the area in apparent distress , reporting sudden flu-like symptoms .
in the connecticut port of new london , dozens of people pretending to be victims lie under overturned buses in a scenario mocked up to be the result of a chemical attack .
the department of homeland security says both types of attack are plausible but neither was chosen because of any specific intelligence .
officials in both canada and britain are involved in the $ 16m exercise known as topoff 3 , for top official .
topoff 2 was held in may 2003 and involved 8,500 people in the us and canada .
it was the first large-scale counter-terrorism exercise after the 11 september 2001 attacks on new york and washington .

a study will examine whether the number of cell phone " relay stations " can be reduced by firms having to share them .
ministers are already reviewing the planning procedure for the masts .
the announcement follows considerable public concern over the location of masts - but scientific opinion about possible health risks remains divided .
ofcom probe in january , scientists from the national radiological protection board warned that young people were at greatest risk from the potentially harmful health effects of mobile phone emissions .
professor sir william stewart , who headed the study , said there was no evidence mobile telephones were unsafe - but children under eight should not use them at all . "
it is important to identify the future direction of mobile phone technology in order to inform policy development and to respond to public interest in this area " yvette cooper , planning minister the board also said more research could be done into mobile phone masts and suggested the location of the masts could be subject to independent review .
" it is important to identify the future direction of mobile phone technology in order to inform policy development and to respond to public interest in this area , " planning minister yvette cooper said .
the study will assess whether ofcom provides adequate information about current mast locations .
in 2002 , the government and the mobile phone industry pledged £ 7.4m to a new research programme into the safety of mobile phones .
its 15 studies , being carried out by independent scientists , will aim to come up with definitive answers on mobile phone safety .
the latest review of the evidence , carried out by uk government scientists , suggested mobile phones do not harm health .
tingling sensations but other studies have highlighted the possible dangers of using mobile telephones .
in 2003 dutch government scientists exposed volunteers in laboratories to radiation from phone masts for the high-tech third generation mobile phones and " traditional " masts - without telling them which version they were being exposed to .
seventy-two people took part in the study , half of whom had complained about the health effects of living near traditional mobile masts .
the survey found both those who had complained about mobile phones radiation - and even those who had not - complained about significant levels of nausea , headaches and tingling sensations when they were exposed to signals that mimicked third generation mobile networks .
in contrast , exposure to radiation from standard masts showed no significant effect .
but maarten lortzer , a spokesman for the dutch research organisation tno , which carried out the research on behalf of the government , told bbc news online other studies needed to be carried out to confirm the finding .
' nerve damage ' a 750-people study by the karolinska institute in sweden published last year concluded that long-term mobile phone users had nearly double the risk of acoustic neuroma - a benign tumour in the auditory nerve , which can cause brain and nerve damage and affects one in 100,000 people .
at the time of the study only analogue mobile phones had been in use for more than 10 years .
the majority of people now have digital -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which came on to the market in the mid to late 1990s .
some of the people who took part in the study had used both analogue and digital phones .
there was no evidence to suggest solely using digital phones for 10 years increased the risk .
another dutch study has suggested mobile phone use can affect brain function , and further eu-funded research indicated radiation from the phones could damage cell dna .

a study will examine whether the number of cell phone " relay stations " can be reduced by firms having to share them .
ministers are already reviewing the planning procedure for the masts .
the announcement follows considerable public concern over the location of masts - but scientific opinion about possible health risks remains divided .
ofcom probe in january , scientists from the national radiological protection board warned that young people were at greatest risk from the potentially harmful health effects of mobile phone emissions .
professor sir william stewart , who headed the study , said there was no evidence mobile telephones were unsafe - but children under eight should not use them at all .
it is important to identify the future direction of mobile phone technology in order to inform policy development and to respond to public interest in this area yvette cooper , planning minister the board also said more research could be done into mobile phone masts and suggested the location of the masts could be subject to independent review .
" it is important to identify the future direction of mobile phone technology in order to inform policy development and to respond to public interest in this area , " planning minister yvette cooper said .
the study will assess whether ofcom provides adequate information about current mast locations .
in 2002 , the government and the mobile phone industry pledged £ 7.4m to a new research programme into the safety of mobile phones .
its 15 studies , being carried out by independent scientists , will aim to come up with definitive answers on mobile phone safety .
the latest review of the evidence , carried out by uk government scientists , suggested mobile phones do not harm health .
tingling sensations but other studies have highlighted the possible dangers of using mobile telephones .
in 2003 dutch government scientists exposed volunteers in laboratories to radiation from phone masts for the high-tech third generation mobile phones and " traditional " masts - without telling them which version they were being exposed to .
seventy-two people took part in the study , half of whom had complained about the health effects of living near traditional mobile masts .
the survey found both those who had complained about mobile phones radiation - and even those who had not - complained about significant levels of nausea , headaches and tingling sensations when they were exposed to signals that mimicked third generation mobile networks .
in contrast , exposure to radiation from standard masts showed no significant effect .
but maarten lortzer , a spokesman for the dutch research organisation tno , which carried out the research on behalf of the government , told bbc news online other studies needed to be carried out to confirm the finding .
' nerve damage ' a 750-people study by the karolinska institute in sweden published last year concluded that long-term mobile phone users had nearly double the risk of acoustic neuroma - a benign tumour in the auditory nerve , which can cause brain and nerve damage and affects one in 100,000 people .
at the time of the study only analogue mobile phones had been in use for more than 10 years .
the majority of people now have digital -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which came on to the market in the mid to late 1990s .
some of the people who took part in the study had used both analogue and digital phones .
there was no evidence to suggest solely using digital phones for 10 years increased the risk .
another dutch study has suggested mobile phone use can affect brain function , and further eu-funded research indicated radiation from the phones could damage cell dna .

in contrast , exposure to radiation from standard masts showed no significant effect .
but maarten lortzer , a spokesman for the dutch research organisation tno , which carried out the research on behalf of the government , told bbc news online other studies needed to be carried out to confirm the finding .
' nerve damage ' a 750-people study by the karolinska institute in sweden published last year concluded that long-term mobile phone users had nearly double the risk of acoustic neuroma - a benign tumour in the auditory nerve , which can cause brain and nerve damage and affects one in 100,000 people .
at the time of the study only analogue mobile phones had been in use for more than 10 years .
the majority of people now have digital -lrb- gsm -rrb- phones , which came on to the market in the mid to late 1990s .
some of the people who took part in the study had used both analogue and digital phones .
there was no evidence to suggest solely using digital phones for 10 years increased the risk .
another dutch study has suggested mobile phone use can affect brain function , and further eu-funded research indicated radiation from the phones could damage cell dna .

the government estimates binge-drinking costs britain about £ 20bn a year and mps want pubs to pay more towards policing drink-fuelled disorder .

planning ' needed ' home affairs committee chairman john denham said : " the attention on 24-hour licensing misses the point - problems of disorder are occurring now .
