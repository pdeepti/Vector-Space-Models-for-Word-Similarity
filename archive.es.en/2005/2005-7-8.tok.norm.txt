in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "

they have reportedly all been sold already .
the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .

" the price is decisive , " she said .
" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .
if we succeed in achieving the same level of management as our foreign competitors and , at the same time , at chinese prices , then we can certainly beat them . "
china can score in the long-term the ambitious aspirations of chinese manufacturers on foreign markets reflects a change in china 's industrial policies .

estimates show that the production capacities of the chinese automobile industry will triple by 2007 to 15 million cars per year .
this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .
industry experts are of the opinion that the chinese can score mainly with inexpensive models in the compact car sector in the long-term , as they offer good design and technology .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged to increase aid to africa by $ 50 billion british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed . speaking a day after bombings left london reeling in bloody chaos , blair announced agreement on a package of aid for africa and measures to confront global warming that he said stood in stark contrast to the despair wrought by terrorism . " we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .

she said nehm noted the methods and targets of thursday 's rush-hour attacks on underground trains and a bus indicated an islamic extremist organization was behind the plot .
the spokeswoman said nehm was in close contact with british authorities .
the foreign ministry said earlier that at least two germans were among the some 700 wounded in london but that their injuries were not critical .
a spokesman said german authorities were in contact with the victims and their families following the blasts , which killed at least 50 .
he added that there could be more germans among the victims because their nationalities had not yet been clarified . more briefs 08.07.2005 -pipe- internet worm creator gets suspended sentence 07.07.2005 -pipe- germany 's schily heading to london 07.07.2005 -pipe- schröder condemns london bombings 07.07.2005 -pipe- germany increases security after attacks 07.07.2005 -pipe- g4 draft on un security council expansion 06.07.2005 -pipe- schröder meets geldof , bono 06.07.2005 -pipe- schröder hits back at lafontaine 06.07.2005 -pipe- pope expected to visit cologne synagogue radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" of course our thoughts are with the victims , " said barry aminata toure , the head of mali 's coalition for alternatives to debt for development . " but we have to wonder : will africa still occupy a central spot at this summit , or will the problem of security , of terrorism trump us ? " blair flew to london around thursday to deal with the aftermath of four terrorist bombings in the capital that killed at least 37 people . but he was back at gleneagles eight hours later to take charge of the summit , hoping to steer it toward a conclusion that will yield a substantive boost in development aid to africa and firm action to curb greenhouse gas emissions . doubts still hover over aid plans prior to the attacks , diplomatic sources voiced doubts that much headway would be made on the centerpiece of the blair anti-poverty plan - a doubling in annual aid to africa to $ 50 billion by 2010 . while the united states has said its goal is to increase its own aid to africa from $ 4.3 billion this year to $ 8.6 billion by 2010 , president george w. bush and his fellow conservatives have made clear their insistence that more development assistance is not necessarily what africa needs most . they have insisted instead that aid should be targeted and reserved for those countries that agree to implement market-oriented economic reform , a demand that activists say will leave many africans worse off . hopes are higher for action on debt cancellation , with the summit expected to endorse a proposal - already accepted by g8 finance ministers - to write off $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 poor countries to international institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , center , speaks during a group photo of g8 and other leaders at the gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , scotland , thursday july 7 , 2005 .

the highly contentious issue of european union and us agricultural export subsidies , which harm the interests of african producers , is expected to be left to the world trade organization to resolve . compromise on global warming ? the g8 has meanwhile completed a declaration and action plan on global warming that builds a bridge between the united states and its partners , according to french president jacques chirac . " the agreement which we are set to reach is an important agreement , even if it does n't go as far as we would have wanted , " chirac told a press conference .
" it restores dialogue between the seven -lrb- g8 -rrb- kyoto members and the united states , " he said . the united states is the loner in the global effort to combat greenhouse gases - the byproduct of fossil fuels that trap the sun 's heat , drive up earth 's surface temperature and damage its delicate system .
bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 shaken european press puts continent on alert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british papers responded with a mixture of sorrow and defiance europe 's press reacted with horror friday to the string of terrorist attacks in london , which left at least 37 people dead .
some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .
there was no expectation that british prime minister tony blair would change his policy on iraq following the london blasts , it said .
" his refusal to be intimidated is a perfect reflection of the sang-froid seen yesterday on the streets of the london capital , " liberation said .
" an absence of panic and an impressive composure is the measure of a people whose spirit of resistance we have become familiar with since at least 1940 . "
meanwhile france 's main sports daily l 'equipe broke with tradition by splashing world news onto its front page .
its banner headline " everyone behind london " against a black background was in sharp contrast to wednesday 's headline " why london ? " which referred to the decision to award the 2012 olympics to the british capital rather than paris . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe have beefed up security following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged to increase aid to africa by $ 50 billion british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed . speaking a day after bombings left london reeling in bloody chaos , blair announced agreement on a package of aid for africa and measures to confront global warming that he said stood in stark contrast to the despair wrought by terrorism . " we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .
all the debates were sidelined .

far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .

" we have to have ... maximum consideration of the risk of another attack and that 's why our total effort today is focused on identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice , " said home secretary charles clarke . british officials were examining a claim of responsibility by a previously unknown group calling itself the organization of al qaeda jihad in europe , the government said on friday . in a statement posted on the internet - but which has not been authenticated - the group said the attacks were " in response to the massacres carried out by britain in iraq and afghanistan . "
they threatened similar attacks against italy , denmark and other " crusader " states with troops in iraq and afghanistan . " the web site claim is a serious one , so we will look at that very closely but we have n't eliminated any alternative explanations .
we 're looking at everything very widely , " british home secretary charles clarke told sky news television . suicide attack speculation although anti-terrorist investigators said it was too early to tell , several british newspapers speculated that the attack on the number 30 bus had been the work of a suicide bomber .
andy hayman of the london police specialist operations branch , said the bombs had held 10 lbs .
-lrb- 4.5 kg -rrb- of explosives and could have been carried around in a backpack , reuters reported .
the new york times wrote that they had been detonated by a timing device . the synchronized blasts , detonated without warning , occurred within minutes of each other , in an eerie echo of last year 's madrid train bombings , which were blamed on islamic extremists linked to al qaeda . spain said friday it had sent security experts to help in the london investigation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair prime minister tony blair , during a press conference at the end of the group of eight summit in scotland on friday , rejected the possibility that the failure of police or intelligence services could have allowed the attacks to take place . " my opinion is that those people who kill the innocent and cause such bloodshed , that they are responsible and they are solely responsible , " he responded to a journalist 's question , prompting a stony silence . unrecovered bodies rescue services had trouble reaching an unknown number of bodies trapped in the underground system .
they feared the tunnel could collapse while recovering the dead , which one police source suggested could number more than ten , reuters reported .
police said no more survivors were trapped underground . the police bolstered their presence on the streets of the capital to reassure wary commuters on friday , as governments around the world beefed up security in the wake of thursday 's blasts , the worst terror attack ever in britain . sniffer dogs and extra police patrolled london underground stations as service across the rail network , the scene of three devastating explosions , slowly returned to normal . the blasts tore apart packed underground trains and a further bomb peeled off the top a double-decker bus on thursday morning , as terror replaced the euphoria of a day earlier , when london was named host of the 2012 olympic games . london mourns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flowers left near the entrance of king 's cross tube station above the ground , the agony of loved ones of those missing and still unaccounted for had begun . " missing , with school friends at a party or concert , miriam hyman , " read one of a series of hand-made posters at king 's cross station . hyman 's father , john , said he had spoken to his daughter by mobile phone shortly after the bomb , and feared she had left the station to catch the ill-fated bus . " it may be that she is in hospital suffering from shock or has lost her purse with her identification in it , " he said . adding to the sense of tragedy , bunches of flowers fitted with messages of sorrow were piled near the entrance of the tube station . " it 's got nothing to do with politics or religion , " said atiya fatiha , whose daughter often uses the picadilly line that runs through king 's cross station , near to where a bomb exploded on a train killing at least 21 people .
" these were just ordinary people going to work , " said fatiha , with tears rolling down her cheeks as she lay a wreath down with about a dozen more , on fencing near the main entrance to the tube , which remains still shut . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de london hit by terrorist bombings four explosions ripped through london 's public transportation network on thursday , killing dozens and injuring hundreds of others in a terrorist attack timed to coincide with the g8 summit in scotland .

some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .
there was no expectation that british prime minister tony blair would change his policy on iraq following the london blasts , it said .
" his refusal to be intimidated is a perfect reflection of the sang-froid seen yesterday on the streets of the london capital , " liberation said .
" an absence of panic and an impressive composure is the measure of a people whose spirit of resistance we have become familiar with since at least 1940 . "
meanwhile france 's main sports daily l 'equipe broke with tradition by splashing world news onto its front page .
its banner headline " everyone behind london " against a black background was in sharp contrast to wednesday 's headline " why london ? " which referred to the decision to award the 2012 olympics to the british capital rather than paris . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe have beefed up security following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .
german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .
" anyone who questions the security measures and the concept of the police for combating terrorism is endangering the people of our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist mohammed atta , who flew one of the planes into the world trade center , lived in this street in hamburg according to gdp , there are currently preliminary proceedings in 160 cases against alleged terrorists in germany .
attacks that had been planned in germany could be prevented through the good cooperation with security authorities .
" they pointed to islamic terrorists , who do not shy away from killing as many people as possible to spread the maximum possible fear , " said freiberg .
no cause for panic , but for caution the green 's parliamentary leader volker beck said the existing security laws were adequate .
he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .
" there is no cause for panic , but for caution .
open societies are always exposed to terrorist danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily says germany belongs to the safest countries in the world schily has announced a third security package .
but the likely early elections have put these plans on the back burner .
on a european level , the european union also introduced stricter security measures since september 11 .
but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .
" we know that terrorists like these select soft targets for their murderous activities , " said schily .
" we ca n't protect all soft targets in europe , not all trains , office buildings or discotheques .
it is absolutely impossible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 shaken european press puts continent on alert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british papers responded with a mixture of sorrow and defiance europe 's press reacted with horror friday to the string of terrorist attacks in london , which left at least 37 people dead .
some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "
" another benefit is that though it may be a car from china , it is thoroughly a european automobile : designed by an italian and optimized by porsche , " she added .
" in this sense , it fulfils european needs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiangling motors wants to prove they can build vehicles for the european market three chinese manufacturers export to europe so far .
this week , 200 of the first suv landwind were delivered to the netherlands .
they have reportedly all been sold already .
the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .
without financial support from the government , the landwind would never have been able to drive off the production line in jiangxi province .
the price is decisive europe might still be looking down its nose at chinese cars .
but market observers reckon that the chinese might follow the same road as the japanese , which convinced more and more customers in the long-run with low prices and much technological gadgetry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers ca n't refuse " made in china " if it has the right price tag in times of economic recessions , many a customer will think twice if he can refuse a deal 30 to 50 percent less just because of the " made in china " stamp , said liu juan .
" the price is decisive , " she said .
" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .
if we succeed in achieving the same level of management as our foreign competitors and , at the same time , at chinese prices , then we can certainly beat them . "
china can score in the long-term the ambitious aspirations of chinese manufacturers on foreign markets reflects a change in china 's industrial policies .
in the past 20 years , china has systematically built up its production base by bringing foreign companies like volkswagen or general motors into the country .
estimates show that the production capacities of the chinese automobile industry will triple by 2007 to 15 million cars per year .
this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .
industry experts are of the opinion that the chinese can score mainly with inexpensive models in the compact car sector in the long-term , as they offer good design and technology .
the association of german automobile manufacturers vda is n't worried , though .
vda president bernd gottschalk said that china will not achieve a significant market share in the next five years . kerstin lohse -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .

" of course our thoughts are with the victims , " said barry aminata toure , the head of mali 's coalition for alternatives to debt for development . " but we have to wonder : will africa still occupy a central spot at this summit , or will the problem of security , of terrorism trump us ? " blair flew to london around thursday to deal with the aftermath of four terrorist bombings in the capital that killed at least 37 people . but he was back at gleneagles eight hours later to take charge of the summit , hoping to steer it toward a conclusion that will yield a substantive boost in development aid to africa and firm action to curb greenhouse gas emissions . doubts still hover over aid plans prior to the attacks , diplomatic sources voiced doubts that much headway would be made on the centerpiece of the blair anti-poverty plan - a doubling in annual aid to africa to $ 50 billion by 2010 . while the united states has said its goal is to increase its own aid to africa from $ 4.3 billion this year to $ 8.6 billion by 2010 , president george w. bush and his fellow conservatives have made clear their insistence that more development assistance is not necessarily what africa needs most . they have insisted instead that aid should be targeted and reserved for those countries that agree to implement market-oriented economic reform , a demand that activists say will leave many africans worse off . hopes are higher for action on debt cancellation , with the summit expected to endorse a proposal - already accepted by g8 finance ministers - to write off $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 poor countries to international institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , center , speaks during a group photo of g8 and other leaders at the gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , scotland , thursday july 7 , 2005 .

" of course our thoughts are with the victims , " said barry aminata toure , the head of mali 's coalition for alternatives to debt for development . " but we have to wonder : will africa still occupy a central spot at this summit , or will the problem of security , of terrorism trump us ? " blair flew to london around thursday to deal with the aftermath of four terrorist bombings in the capital that killed at least 37 people . but he was back at gleneagles eight hours later to take charge of the summit , hoping to steer it toward a conclusion that will yield a substantive boost in development aid to africa and firm action to curb greenhouse gas emissions . doubts still hover over aid plans prior to the attacks , diplomatic sources voiced doubts that much headway would be made on the centerpiece of the blair anti-poverty plan - a doubling in annual aid to africa to $ 50 billion by 2010 . while the united states has said its goal is to increase its own aid to africa from $ 4.3 billion this year to $ 8.6 billion by 2010 , president george w. bush and his fellow conservatives have made clear their insistence that more development assistance is not necessarily what africa needs most . they have insisted instead that aid should be targeted and reserved for those countries that agree to implement market-oriented economic reform , a demand that activists say will leave many africans worse off . hopes are higher for action on debt cancellation , with the summit expected to endorse a proposal - already accepted by g8 finance ministers - to write off $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 poor countries to international institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , center , speaks during a group photo of g8 and other leaders at the gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , scotland , thursday july 7 , 2005 .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "
" another benefit is that though it may be a car from china , it is thoroughly a european automobile : designed by an italian and optimized by porsche , " she added .
" in this sense , it fulfils european needs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiangling motors wants to prove they can build vehicles for the european market three chinese manufacturers export to europe so far .
this week , 200 of the first suv landwind were delivered to the netherlands .
they have reportedly all been sold already .
the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .
without financial support from the government , the landwind would never have been able to drive off the production line in jiangxi province .
the price is decisive europe might still be looking down its nose at chinese cars .
but market observers reckon that the chinese might follow the same road as the japanese , which convinced more and more customers in the long-run with low prices and much technological gadgetry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers ca n't refuse " made in china " if it has the right price tag in times of economic recessions , many a customer will think twice if he can refuse a deal 30 to 50 percent less just because of the " made in china " stamp , said liu juan .
" the price is decisive , " she said .
" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .
if we succeed in achieving the same level of management as our foreign competitors and , at the same time , at chinese prices , then we can certainly beat them . "
china can score in the long-term the ambitious aspirations of chinese manufacturers on foreign markets reflects a change in china 's industrial policies .
in the past 20 years , china has systematically built up its production base by bringing foreign companies like volkswagen or general motors into the country .
estimates show that the production capacities of the chinese automobile industry will triple by 2007 to 15 million cars per year .
this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .
industry experts are of the opinion that the chinese can score mainly with inexpensive models in the compact car sector in the long-term , as they offer good design and technology .
the association of german automobile manufacturers vda is n't worried , though .
vda president bernd gottschalk said that china will not achieve a significant market share in the next five years . kerstin lohse -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .
but as affordable foreign cars offer consumers an attractive alternative , how long will this still be the case ?

others are resigned to the continuing decline in market share in china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged to increase aid to africa by $ 50 billion british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed . speaking a day after bombings left london reeling in bloody chaos , blair announced agreement on a package of aid for africa and measures to confront global warming that he said stood in stark contrast to the despair wrought by terrorism . " we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .
all the debates were sidelined .

" we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .
all the debates were sidelined .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "
" another benefit is that though it may be a car from china , it is thoroughly a european automobile : designed by an italian and optimized by porsche , " she added .
" in this sense , it fulfils european needs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiangling motors wants to prove they can build vehicles for the european market three chinese manufacturers export to europe so far .
this week , 200 of the first suv landwind were delivered to the netherlands .
they have reportedly all been sold already .
the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .
without financial support from the government , the landwind would never have been able to drive off the production line in jiangxi province .
the price is decisive europe might still be looking down its nose at chinese cars .
but market observers reckon that the chinese might follow the same road as the japanese , which convinced more and more customers in the long-run with low prices and much technological gadgetry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers ca n't refuse " made in china " if it has the right price tag in times of economic recessions , many a customer will think twice if he can refuse a deal 30 to 50 percent less just because of the " made in china " stamp , said liu juan .
" the price is decisive , " she said .
" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .
if we succeed in achieving the same level of management as our foreign competitors and , at the same time , at chinese prices , then we can certainly beat them . "
china can score in the long-term the ambitious aspirations of chinese manufacturers on foreign markets reflects a change in china 's industrial policies .
in the past 20 years , china has systematically built up its production base by bringing foreign companies like volkswagen or general motors into the country .
estimates show that the production capacities of the chinese automobile industry will triple by 2007 to 15 million cars per year .
this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .
industry experts are of the opinion that the chinese can score mainly with inexpensive models in the compact car sector in the long-term , as they offer good design and technology .
the association of german automobile manufacturers vda is n't worried , though .
vda president bernd gottschalk said that china will not achieve a significant market share in the next five years . kerstin lohse -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .

he was also ordered to perform 30 hours of public service in a hospital or retirement home . the sasser worm struck on may 1 , 2004 and in less than a week hit thousands of companies and as many as 18 million computers worldwide , forcing some businesses to shut in order to debug their systems and causing millions of dollars in lost productivity . jaschan gave a full confession on the first day of his trial tuesday on charges of computer sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public administration .
the charges would normally carry a prison sentence of up to five years for an adult . sasser exploited a flaw in certain versions of microsoft 's windows operating systems - windows 2000 , windows server 2003 and windows xp - and forced the computer into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .
it apparently did no lasting harm . the german unit of the software giant welcomed the verdict and said it would pay a $ 250,000 -lrb- 209,000 euro -rrb- reward to unnamed informants who had led to jaschan 's conviction .
reluctant cooperation a computer worm , unlike a virus , does not have to travel through e-mail but can spread by itself to any unprotected computer linked to the internet .
sasser 's victims were as far flung as the european commission in brussels , taiwan 's postal service and australian rail traffic controllers .
us airline delta was forced to cancel several flights and finland 's third-largest bank shut its 130 branch offices in a preventive move to keep the worm from infecting its computers . german prosecutors have only been able to document some 130,000 euros in damage from sasser but computer experts say the true figure is in the millions .
many companies were reluctant to cooperate with the authorities for fear of acknowledging holes in their computer security systems . jaschan , whose parents own a computer service company , now works for a german security software firm called securepoint which specializes in defenses against viruses and worms .

some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .
there was no expectation that british prime minister tony blair would change his policy on iraq following the london blasts , it said .
" his refusal to be intimidated is a perfect reflection of the sang-froid seen yesterday on the streets of the london capital , " liberation said .
" an absence of panic and an impressive composure is the measure of a people whose spirit of resistance we have become familiar with since at least 1940 . "
meanwhile france 's main sports daily l 'equipe broke with tradition by splashing world news onto its front page .
its banner headline " everyone behind london " against a black background was in sharp contrast to wednesday 's headline " why london ? " which referred to the decision to award the 2012 olympics to the british capital rather than paris . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe have beefed up security following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

" of course our thoughts are with the victims , " said barry aminata toure , the head of mali 's coalition for alternatives to debt for development . " but we have to wonder : will africa still occupy a central spot at this summit , or will the problem of security , of terrorism trump us ? " blair flew to london around thursday to deal with the aftermath of four terrorist bombings in the capital that killed at least 37 people . but he was back at gleneagles eight hours later to take charge of the summit , hoping to steer it toward a conclusion that will yield a substantive boost in development aid to africa and firm action to curb greenhouse gas emissions . doubts still hover over aid plans prior to the attacks , diplomatic sources voiced doubts that much headway would be made on the centerpiece of the blair anti-poverty plan - a doubling in annual aid to africa to $ 50 billion by 2010 . while the united states has said its goal is to increase its own aid to africa from $ 4.3 billion this year to $ 8.6 billion by 2010 , president george w. bush and his fellow conservatives have made clear their insistence that more development assistance is not necessarily what africa needs most . they have insisted instead that aid should be targeted and reserved for those countries that agree to implement market-oriented economic reform , a demand that activists say will leave many africans worse off . hopes are higher for action on debt cancellation , with the summit expected to endorse a proposal - already accepted by g8 finance ministers - to write off $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 poor countries to international institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , center , speaks during a group photo of g8 and other leaders at the gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , scotland , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
explosions on london 's transport system killed a number of people and caused chaos in the british capital at rush hour on thursday morning .
blair will return to london to deal with the crisis and is reported to be returning to the summit later in the evening .
standing second left is u.s. president george w. bush and right is french president jacques chirac .
standing far left is south africa 's president thabo mbeki .
-lrb- ap photo / charlie bibby , financial times -rrb- no headway is likely on trade concessions , the third pillar of the blair plan .
the highly contentious issue of european union and us agricultural export subsidies , which harm the interests of african producers , is expected to be left to the world trade organization to resolve . compromise on global warming ? the g8 has meanwhile completed a declaration and action plan on global warming that builds a bridge between the united states and its partners , according to french president jacques chirac . " the agreement which we are set to reach is an important agreement , even if it does n't go as far as we would have wanted , " chirac told a press conference .
" it restores dialogue between the seven -lrb- g8 -rrb- kyoto members and the united states , " he said . the united states is the loner in the global effort to combat greenhouse gases - the byproduct of fossil fuels that trap the sun 's heat , drive up earth 's surface temperature and damage its delicate system .
bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said . " the agreement lacks a clear acknowledgement of the urgent need for action and fails to state any significant steps g8 leaders will take to tackle climate change , " added friends of the earth international . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

vienna fears an invasion of foreign students , especially from germany . there were long queues outside vienna 's medical university this week .
some would-be students even camped out overnight .
they wanted to be among the first to enroll for the new university year - and they wanted to beat the germans . " the problem is that everyone 's panicked because of the european court decision that will allow germans in .
everyone wants to enroll as quickly as possible , " one student said . any student who has completed high school in austria has the right to a place at university .
but this right is not extended to students from other eu countries .
they must prove they have a place at a university in their home country before being allowed to study in austria .
that is discrimination and thus unacceptable , the european court of justice ruled thursday . the decision was widely anticipated and austria 's universities expect it will open the gates to a flood of german students .
professor christiana spiel , dean of vienna university 's psychology department and a member of the government 's future commission on education said the fears were well founded .
invading students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think they are very realistic because in germany there are about 13,000 students interested in studying psychology .
however , only 3,000 of them get the opportunity .
so the rest of the 10,000 students … we really expect that some of them - and not so few - will come to austria . " austria expects up to 80,000 german students who failed test to enter german medical , veterinary and economic faculties to try to enroll at austrian universities . " a nation of eight million people can not offer places to study to all those who have been rejected in germany , a nation of 80 million people , " education minister elisabeth gehrer told the kurier newspaper . in response to the ruling , gehrer said she would submit a bill to parliament friday to end unscreened access to universities .
the limitations would concern studies in medicine , veterinary medicine , dentistry , pharmacy and biology .
should the bill be adopted by parliament " university directors will have the possibility to impose entrance exams or a grading semester , " gehrer said . austria is the only european union country that does not regulate access to university studies . a total 210,000 students have enrolled in austrian universities for the 2004/05 semesters , according to official figures . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paving the way for academic excellence germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- june 13 , 2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

he was also ordered to perform 30 hours of public service in a hospital or retirement home . the sasser worm struck on may 1 , 2004 and in less than a week hit thousands of companies and as many as 18 million computers worldwide , forcing some businesses to shut in order to debug their systems and causing millions of dollars in lost productivity . jaschan gave a full confession on the first day of his trial tuesday on charges of computer sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public administration .
the charges would normally carry a prison sentence of up to five years for an adult . sasser exploited a flaw in certain versions of microsoft 's windows operating systems - windows 2000 , windows server 2003 and windows xp - and forced the computer into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .

opposition leaders have called for stricter anti-terrorism measures , while the ruling coalition says it 's doing enough . two months before germany 's likely early elections , the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for tighter security laws .
" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .
bosbach recalled that a trail from the last such attacks in europe , in madrid in march 2004 , had led to germany .
it was now crucial to close possible security gaps in germany and " consider which acute security measures have to be added . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at the british embassy in berlin has been tightened .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein from the cdu sister party christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said that there was no indication of any pending attacks .
" but an abstract increase in danger is self-evident , " beckstein told german television zdf .
german interior minister otto schily reiterated that the country remains under threat by extremists .
" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .
german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .
" anyone who questions the security measures and the concept of the police for combating terrorism is endangering the people of our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist mohammed atta , who flew one of the planes into the world trade center , lived in this street in hamburg according to gdp , there are currently preliminary proceedings in 160 cases against alleged terrorists in germany .
attacks that had been planned in germany could be prevented through the good cooperation with security authorities .
" they pointed to islamic terrorists , who do not shy away from killing as many people as possible to spread the maximum possible fear , " said freiberg .
no cause for panic , but for caution the green 's parliamentary leader volker beck said the existing security laws were adequate .
he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .
" there is no cause for panic , but for caution .
open societies are always exposed to terrorist danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily says germany belongs to the safest countries in the world schily has announced a third security package .
but the likely early elections have put these plans on the back burner .
on a european level , the european union also introduced stricter security measures since september 11 .
but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .
" we know that terrorists like these select soft targets for their murderous activities , " said schily .
" we ca n't protect all soft targets in europe , not all trains , office buildings or discotheques .

german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .
" anyone who questions the security measures and the concept of the police for combating terrorism is endangering the people of our country . "

attacks that had been planned in germany could be prevented through the good cooperation with security authorities .
" they pointed to islamic terrorists , who do not shy away from killing as many people as possible to spread the maximum possible fear , " said freiberg .
no cause for panic , but for caution the green 's parliamentary leader volker beck said the existing security laws were adequate .
he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .
" there is no cause for panic , but for caution .
open societies are always exposed to terrorist danger . "

but the likely early elections have put these plans on the back burner .
on a european level , the european union also introduced stricter security measures since september 11 .
but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .
" we know that terrorists like these select soft targets for their murderous activities , " said schily .
" we ca n't protect all soft targets in europe , not all trains , office buildings or discotheques .

opposition leaders have called for stricter anti-terrorism measures , while the ruling coalition says it 's doing enough . two months before germany 's likely early elections , the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for tighter security laws .
" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .
bosbach recalled that a trail from the last such attacks in europe , in madrid in march 2004 , had led to germany .
it was now crucial to close possible security gaps in germany and " consider which acute security measures have to be added . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at the british embassy in berlin has been tightened .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein from the cdu sister party christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said that there was no indication of any pending attacks .
" but an abstract increase in danger is self-evident , " beckstein told german television zdf .
german interior minister otto schily reiterated that the country remains under threat by extremists .
" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .
german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .
" anyone who questions the security measures and the concept of the police for combating terrorism is endangering the people of our country . "

" they pointed to islamic terrorists , who do not shy away from killing as many people as possible to spread the maximum possible fear , " said freiberg .
no cause for panic , but for caution the green 's parliamentary leader volker beck said the existing security laws were adequate .
he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .

open societies are always exposed to terrorist danger . "

but the likely early elections have put these plans on the back burner .

but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .

" of course our thoughts are with the victims , " said barry aminata toure , the head of mali 's coalition for alternatives to debt for development . " but we have to wonder : will africa still occupy a central spot at this summit , or will the problem of security , of terrorism trump us ? " blair flew to london around thursday to deal with the aftermath of four terrorist bombings in the capital that killed at least 37 people . but he was back at gleneagles eight hours later to take charge of the summit , hoping to steer it toward a conclusion that will yield a substantive boost in development aid to africa and firm action to curb greenhouse gas emissions . doubts still hover over aid plans prior to the attacks , diplomatic sources voiced doubts that much headway would be made on the centerpiece of the blair anti-poverty plan - a doubling in annual aid to africa to $ 50 billion by 2010 . while the united states has said its goal is to increase its own aid to africa from $ 4.3 billion this year to $ 8.6 billion by 2010 , president george w. bush and his fellow conservatives have made clear their insistence that more development assistance is not necessarily what africa needs most . they have insisted instead that aid should be targeted and reserved for those countries that agree to implement market-oriented economic reform , a demand that activists say will leave many africans worse off . hopes are higher for action on debt cancellation , with the summit expected to endorse a proposal - already accepted by g8 finance ministers - to write off $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 poor countries to international institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , center , speaks during a group photo of g8 and other leaders at the gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , scotland , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
explosions on london 's transport system killed a number of people and caused chaos in the british capital at rush hour on thursday morning .
blair will return to london to deal with the crisis and is reported to be returning to the summit later in the evening .

standing far left is south africa 's president thabo mbeki .
-lrb- ap photo / charlie bibby , financial times -rrb- no headway is likely on trade concessions , the third pillar of the blair plan .
the highly contentious issue of european union and us agricultural export subsidies , which harm the interests of african producers , is expected to be left to the world trade organization to resolve . compromise on global warming ? the g8 has meanwhile completed a declaration and action plan on global warming that builds a bridge between the united states and its partners , according to french president jacques chirac . " the agreement which we are set to reach is an important agreement , even if it does n't go as far as we would have wanted , " chirac told a press conference .
" it restores dialogue between the seven -lrb- g8 -rrb- kyoto members and the united states , " he said . the united states is the loner in the global effort to combat greenhouse gases - the byproduct of fossil fuels that trap the sun 's heat , drive up earth 's surface temperature and damage its delicate system .
bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said . " the agreement lacks a clear acknowledgement of the urgent need for action and fails to state any significant steps g8 leaders will take to tackle climate change , " added friends of the earth international . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2005 german films buck cinematic decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's hollywood blockbusters have been putting germans to sleep germany 's best actors and directors have plenty to thank viewers for in their speeches at friday night ’ s german film prize ceremony .
though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .

vienna fears an invasion of foreign students , especially from germany . there were long queues outside vienna 's medical university this week .
some would-be students even camped out overnight .
they wanted to be among the first to enroll for the new university year - and they wanted to beat the germans . " the problem is that everyone 's panicked because of the european court decision that will allow germans in .
everyone wants to enroll as quickly as possible , " one student said . any student who has completed high school in austria has the right to a place at university .
but this right is not extended to students from other eu countries .
they must prove they have a place at a university in their home country before being allowed to study in austria .
that is discrimination and thus unacceptable , the european court of justice ruled thursday . the decision was widely anticipated and austria 's universities expect it will open the gates to a flood of german students .
professor christiana spiel , dean of vienna university 's psychology department and a member of the government 's future commission on education said the fears were well founded .
invading students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think they are very realistic because in germany there are about 13,000 students interested in studying psychology .
however , only 3,000 of them get the opportunity .
so the rest of the 10,000 students … we really expect that some of them - and not so few - will come to austria . " austria expects up to 80,000 german students who failed test to enter german medical , veterinary and economic faculties to try to enroll at austrian universities . " a nation of eight million people can not offer places to study to all those who have been rejected in germany , a nation of 80 million people , " education minister elisabeth gehrer told the kurier newspaper . in response to the ruling , gehrer said she would submit a bill to parliament friday to end unscreened access to universities .
the limitations would concern studies in medicine , veterinary medicine , dentistry , pharmacy and biology .
should the bill be adopted by parliament " university directors will have the possibility to impose entrance exams or a grading semester , " gehrer said . austria is the only european union country that does not regulate access to university studies . a total 210,000 students have enrolled in austrian universities for the 2004/05 semesters , according to official figures . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paving the way for academic excellence germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- june 13 , 2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .

" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "

the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .
without financial support from the government , the landwind would never have been able to drive off the production line in jiangxi province .

" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .

this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .

yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .

in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "

the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .

this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 g8 vows to finish work under terror cloud großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings have thrown a shadow over the summit group of eight leaders will try to put the horror of the london terrorist attacks behind them friday as they wrap up a three-day summit with long-awaited statements on combating poverty in africa and global warming . with british prime minister tony blair again at the helm , the g8 will debate ambitious proposals to deliver a package of aid , debt cancellation and trade concessions to africa crafted by blair and his finance minister gordon brown . while the g8 spoke as one on thursday to denounce the blasts and to assert they would not derail the summit , aid activists and environmentalists fear that africa and climate change will suffer here at the hands of leaders once again preoccupied by terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergence services carry a woman into an ambulance at kings cross train station after multiple explosions rocked the capital in london , thursday , july 7 , 2005 .
" of course our thoughts are with the victims , " said barry aminata toure , the head of mali 's coalition for alternatives to debt for development . " but we have to wonder : will africa still occupy a central spot at this summit , or will the problem of security , of terrorism trump us ? " blair flew to london around thursday to deal with the aftermath of four terrorist bombings in the capital that killed at least 37 people . but he was back at gleneagles eight hours later to take charge of the summit , hoping to steer it toward a conclusion that will yield a substantive boost in development aid to africa and firm action to curb greenhouse gas emissions . doubts still hover over aid plans prior to the attacks , diplomatic sources voiced doubts that much headway would be made on the centerpiece of the blair anti-poverty plan - a doubling in annual aid to africa to $ 50 billion by 2010 . while the united states has said its goal is to increase its own aid to africa from $ 4.3 billion this year to $ 8.6 billion by 2010 , president george w. bush and his fellow conservatives have made clear their insistence that more development assistance is not necessarily what africa needs most . they have insisted instead that aid should be targeted and reserved for those countries that agree to implement market-oriented economic reform , a demand that activists say will leave many africans worse off . hopes are higher for action on debt cancellation , with the summit expected to endorse a proposal - already accepted by g8 finance ministers - to write off $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 poor countries to international institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , center , speaks during a group photo of g8 and other leaders at the gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , scotland , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
explosions on london 's transport system killed a number of people and caused chaos in the british capital at rush hour on thursday morning .
blair will return to london to deal with the crisis and is reported to be returning to the summit later in the evening .
standing second left is u.s. president george w. bush and right is french president jacques chirac .
standing far left is south africa 's president thabo mbeki .
-lrb- ap photo / charlie bibby , financial times -rrb- no headway is likely on trade concessions , the third pillar of the blair plan .
the highly contentious issue of european union and us agricultural export subsidies , which harm the interests of african producers , is expected to be left to the world trade organization to resolve . compromise on global warming ? the g8 has meanwhile completed a declaration and action plan on global warming that builds a bridge between the united states and its partners , according to french president jacques chirac . " the agreement which we are set to reach is an important agreement , even if it does n't go as far as we would have wanted , " chirac told a press conference .
" it restores dialogue between the seven -lrb- g8 -rrb- kyoto members and the united states , " he said . the united states is the loner in the global effort to combat greenhouse gases - the byproduct of fossil fuels that trap the sun 's heat , drive up earth 's surface temperature and damage its delicate system .
bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said . " the agreement lacks a clear acknowledgement of the urgent need for action and fails to state any significant steps g8 leaders will take to tackle climate change , " added friends of the earth international . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 shaken european press puts continent on alert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british papers responded with a mixture of sorrow and defiance europe 's press reacted with horror friday to the string of terrorist attacks in london , which left at least 37 people dead .
some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .
there was no expectation that british prime minister tony blair would change his policy on iraq following the london blasts , it said .
" his refusal to be intimidated is a perfect reflection of the sang-froid seen yesterday on the streets of the london capital , " liberation said .
" an absence of panic and an impressive composure is the measure of a people whose spirit of resistance we have become familiar with since at least 1940 . "
meanwhile france 's main sports daily l 'equipe broke with tradition by splashing world news onto its front page .
its banner headline " everyone behind london " against a black background was in sharp contrast to wednesday 's headline " why london ? " which referred to the decision to award the 2012 olympics to the british capital rather than paris . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe have beefed up security following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .
there was no expectation that british prime minister tony blair would change his policy on iraq following the london blasts , it said .
" his refusal to be intimidated is a perfect reflection of the sang-froid seen yesterday on the streets of the london capital , " liberation said .
" an absence of panic and an impressive composure is the measure of a people whose spirit of resistance we have become familiar with since at least 1940 . "
meanwhile france 's main sports daily l 'equipe broke with tradition by splashing world news onto its front page .
its banner headline " everyone behind london " against a black background was in sharp contrast to wednesday 's headline " why london ? " which referred to the decision to award the 2012 olympics to the british capital rather than paris . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe have beefed up security following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .
if we succeed in achieving the same level of management as our foreign competitors and , at the same time , at chinese prices , then we can certainly beat them . "
china can score in the long-term the ambitious aspirations of chinese manufacturers on foreign markets reflects a change in china 's industrial policies .
in the past 20 years , china has systematically built up its production base by bringing foreign companies like volkswagen or general motors into the country .
estimates show that the production capacities of the chinese automobile industry will triple by 2007 to 15 million cars per year .
this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .
industry experts are of the opinion that the chinese can score mainly with inexpensive models in the compact car sector in the long-term , as they offer good design and technology .

though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .
hollywood blockbusters disappoint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood blockbusters did n't bring out the expected crowds as the quality of german movies improves and this year 's hollywood blockbusters , like " star wars iii : revenge of the sixth , " fail to bring relief to theater owners , some may want to begin questioning what they put on their screens .
" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .
" these types of films existed before , but they were more academic and analytical . "
changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .
as the population ages , its viewing habits seem to be becoming more sophisticated .
german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .
" the public is no longer in the 12 to 29 age category that multiplexes appeal to . "

" film rental companies and producers have tapped a second source of income in dvds , clearly to the detriment of the cinema business , " hans-joachim flebbe of the cinemaxx theater chain told the german trade magazine filmecho / filmwoche .
for cinemas to survive as more than part of a studio marketing strategy , they will have to continue changing from dark rooms with gum-covered aisles to places people want to spend more than 90 minutes at a time .

opposition leaders have called for stricter anti-terrorism measures , while the ruling coalition says it 's doing enough . two months before germany 's likely early elections , the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for tighter security laws .
" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .
bosbach recalled that a trail from the last such attacks in europe , in madrid in march 2004 , had led to germany .
it was now crucial to close possible security gaps in germany and " consider which acute security measures have to be added . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at the british embassy in berlin has been tightened .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein from the cdu sister party christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said that there was no indication of any pending attacks .
" but an abstract increase in danger is self-evident , " beckstein told german television zdf .
german interior minister otto schily reiterated that the country remains under threat by extremists .
" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .
german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .
" anyone who questions the security measures and the concept of the police for combating terrorism is endangering the people of our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist mohammed atta , who flew one of the planes into the world trade center , lived in this street in hamburg according to gdp , there are currently preliminary proceedings in 160 cases against alleged terrorists in germany .
attacks that had been planned in germany could be prevented through the good cooperation with security authorities .
" they pointed to islamic terrorists , who do not shy away from killing as many people as possible to spread the maximum possible fear , " said freiberg .
no cause for panic , but for caution the green 's parliamentary leader volker beck said the existing security laws were adequate .
he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .
" there is no cause for panic , but for caution .
open societies are always exposed to terrorist danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily says germany belongs to the safest countries in the world schily has announced a third security package .
but the likely early elections have put these plans on the back burner .
on a european level , the european union also introduced stricter security measures since september 11 .
but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .
" we know that terrorists like these select soft targets for their murderous activities , " said schily .
" we ca n't protect all soft targets in europe , not all trains , office buildings or discotheques .
it is absolutely impossible .

-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- shaken european press puts continent on alert europe 's press reacted with horror to the string of terrorist attacks in london , which left at least 37 people dead .
some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital .
-lrb- july 8 , 2005 -rrb- britain still looking for bombing leads a massive hunt was on friday for the bombers who brought carnage to the heart of london , killing over 50 people and injuring more than 700 in a series of explosions on the transport system .

though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .

" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .
" these types of films existed before , but they were more academic and analytical . "
changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .
as the population ages , its viewing habits seem to be becoming more sophisticated .
german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .
" the public is no longer in the 12 to 29 age category that multiplexes appeal to . "

" film rental companies and producers have tapped a second source of income in dvds , clearly to the detriment of the cinema business , " hans-joachim flebbe of the cinemaxx theater chain told the german trade magazine filmecho / filmwoche .

" of course our thoughts are with the victims , " said barry aminata toure , the head of mali 's coalition for alternatives to debt for development . " but we have to wonder : will africa still occupy a central spot at this summit , or will the problem of security , of terrorism trump us ? " blair flew to london around thursday to deal with the aftermath of four terrorist bombings in the capital that killed at least 37 people . but he was back at gleneagles eight hours later to take charge of the summit , hoping to steer it toward a conclusion that will yield a substantive boost in development aid to africa and firm action to curb greenhouse gas emissions . doubts still hover over aid plans prior to the attacks , diplomatic sources voiced doubts that much headway would be made on the centerpiece of the blair anti-poverty plan - a doubling in annual aid to africa to $ 50 billion by 2010 . while the united states has said its goal is to increase its own aid to africa from $ 4.3 billion this year to $ 8.6 billion by 2010 , president george w. bush and his fellow conservatives have made clear their insistence that more development assistance is not necessarily what africa needs most . they have insisted instead that aid should be targeted and reserved for those countries that agree to implement market-oriented economic reform , a demand that activists say will leave many africans worse off . hopes are higher for action on debt cancellation , with the summit expected to endorse a proposal - already accepted by g8 finance ministers - to write off $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 poor countries to international institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , center , speaks during a group photo of g8 and other leaders at the gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , scotland , thursday july 7 , 2005 .

-lrb- ap photo / charlie bibby , financial times -rrb- no headway is likely on trade concessions , the third pillar of the blair plan .
the highly contentious issue of european union and us agricultural export subsidies , which harm the interests of african producers , is expected to be left to the world trade organization to resolve . compromise on global warming ? the g8 has meanwhile completed a declaration and action plan on global warming that builds a bridge between the united states and its partners , according to french president jacques chirac . " the agreement which we are set to reach is an important agreement , even if it does n't go as far as we would have wanted , " chirac told a press conference .
" it restores dialogue between the seven -lrb- g8 -rrb- kyoto members and the united states , " he said . the united states is the loner in the global effort to combat greenhouse gases - the byproduct of fossil fuels that trap the sun 's heat , drive up earth 's surface temperature and damage its delicate system .
bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said . " the agreement lacks a clear acknowledgement of the urgent need for action and fails to state any significant steps g8 leaders will take to tackle climate change , " added friends of the earth international . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

" of course our thoughts are with the victims , " said barry aminata toure , the head of mali 's coalition for alternatives to debt for development . " but we have to wonder : will africa still occupy a central spot at this summit , or will the problem of security , of terrorism trump us ? " blair flew to london around thursday to deal with the aftermath of four terrorist bombings in the capital that killed at least 37 people . but he was back at gleneagles eight hours later to take charge of the summit , hoping to steer it toward a conclusion that will yield a substantive boost in development aid to africa and firm action to curb greenhouse gas emissions . doubts still hover over aid plans prior to the attacks , diplomatic sources voiced doubts that much headway would be made on the centerpiece of the blair anti-poverty plan - a doubling in annual aid to africa to $ 50 billion by 2010 . while the united states has said its goal is to increase its own aid to africa from $ 4.3 billion this year to $ 8.6 billion by 2010 , president george w. bush and his fellow conservatives have made clear their insistence that more development assistance is not necessarily what africa needs most . they have insisted instead that aid should be targeted and reserved for those countries that agree to implement market-oriented economic reform , a demand that activists say will leave many africans worse off . hopes are higher for action on debt cancellation , with the summit expected to endorse a proposal - already accepted by g8 finance ministers - to write off $ 40 billion in debt owed by 18 poor countries to international institutions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , center , speaks during a group photo of g8 and other leaders at the gleneagles hotel in auchterarder , scotland , thursday july 7 , 2005 .
explosions on london 's transport system killed a number of people and caused chaos in the british capital at rush hour on thursday morning .
blair will return to london to deal with the crisis and is reported to be returning to the summit later in the evening .
standing second left is u.s. president george w. bush and right is french president jacques chirac .
standing far left is south africa 's president thabo mbeki .
-lrb- ap photo / charlie bibby , financial times -rrb- no headway is likely on trade concessions , the third pillar of the blair plan .
the highly contentious issue of european union and us agricultural export subsidies , which harm the interests of african producers , is expected to be left to the world trade organization to resolve . compromise on global warming ? the g8 has meanwhile completed a declaration and action plan on global warming that builds a bridge between the united states and its partners , according to french president jacques chirac . " the agreement which we are set to reach is an important agreement , even if it does n't go as far as we would have wanted , " chirac told a press conference .
" it restores dialogue between the seven -lrb- g8 -rrb- kyoto members and the united states , " he said . the united states is the loner in the global effort to combat greenhouse gases - the byproduct of fossil fuels that trap the sun 's heat , drive up earth 's surface temperature and damage its delicate system .
bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said . " the agreement lacks a clear acknowledgement of the urgent need for action and fails to state any significant steps g8 leaders will take to tackle climate change , " added friends of the earth international . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2005 german films buck cinematic decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's hollywood blockbusters have been putting germans to sleep germany 's best actors and directors have plenty to thank viewers for in their speeches at friday night ’ s german film prize ceremony .
though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .
hollywood blockbusters disappoint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood blockbusters did n't bring out the expected crowds as the quality of german movies improves and this year 's hollywood blockbusters , like " star wars iii : revenge of the sixth , " fail to bring relief to theater owners , some may want to begin questioning what they put on their screens .
" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .
" these types of films existed before , but they were more academic and analytical . "
changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .
as the population ages , its viewing habits seem to be becoming more sophisticated .
german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .
" the public is no longer in the 12 to 29 age category that multiplexes appeal to . "
keeping cinemas a unique experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinemas need to become comfortable meeting spots if they want to survive the interest in german movies , however , is n't enough to make up for the rest of the branch 's falling profits , and germany 's 1,845 theaters need to re-evaluate their marketing strategies as it gets easier to download movies from the internet and the time between a film 's theater launch and dvd release shortens .
" film rental companies and producers have tapped a second source of income in dvds , clearly to the detriment of the cinema business , " hans-joachim flebbe of the cinemaxx theater chain told the german trade magazine filmecho / filmwoche .
for cinemas to survive as more than part of a studio marketing strategy , they will have to continue changing from dark rooms with gum-covered aisles to places people want to spend more than 90 minutes at a time .

though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .

" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .

changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .

german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "
" another benefit is that though it may be a car from china , it is thoroughly a european automobile : designed by an italian and optimized by porsche , " she added .
" in this sense , it fulfils european needs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiangling motors wants to prove they can build vehicles for the european market three chinese manufacturers export to europe so far .
this week , 200 of the first suv landwind were delivered to the netherlands .
they have reportedly all been sold already .
the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .
without financial support from the government , the landwind would never have been able to drive off the production line in jiangxi province .
the price is decisive europe might still be looking down its nose at chinese cars .
but market observers reckon that the chinese might follow the same road as the japanese , which convinced more and more customers in the long-run with low prices and much technological gadgetry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers ca n't refuse " made in china " if it has the right price tag in times of economic recessions , many a customer will think twice if he can refuse a deal 30 to 50 percent less just because of the " made in china " stamp , said liu juan .
" the price is decisive , " she said .
" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .
if we succeed in achieving the same level of management as our foreign competitors and , at the same time , at chinese prices , then we can certainly beat them . "
china can score in the long-term the ambitious aspirations of chinese manufacturers on foreign markets reflects a change in china 's industrial policies .
in the past 20 years , china has systematically built up its production base by bringing foreign companies like volkswagen or general motors into the country .
estimates show that the production capacities of the chinese automobile industry will triple by 2007 to 15 million cars per year .
this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .
industry experts are of the opinion that the chinese can score mainly with inexpensive models in the compact car sector in the long-term , as they offer good design and technology .
the association of german automobile manufacturers vda is n't worried , though .
vda president bernd gottschalk said that china will not achieve a significant market share in the next five years . kerstin lohse -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair prime minister tony blair , during a press conference at the end of the group of eight summit in scotland on friday , rejected the possibility that the failure of police or intelligence services could have allowed the attacks to take place . " my opinion is that those people who kill the innocent and cause such bloodshed , that they are responsible and they are solely responsible , " he responded to a journalist 's question , prompting a stony silence . unrecovered bodies rescue services had trouble reaching an unknown number of bodies trapped in the underground system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2005 german films buck cinematic decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's hollywood blockbusters have been putting germans to sleep germany 's best actors and directors have plenty to thank viewers for in their speeches at friday night ’ s german film prize ceremony .
though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .
hollywood blockbusters disappoint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood blockbusters did n't bring out the expected crowds as the quality of german movies improves and this year 's hollywood blockbusters , like " star wars iii : revenge of the sixth , " fail to bring relief to theater owners , some may want to begin questioning what they put on their screens .
" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .
" these types of films existed before , but they were more academic and analytical . "
changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .
as the population ages , its viewing habits seem to be becoming more sophisticated .
german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .
" the public is no longer in the 12 to 29 age category that multiplexes appeal to . "
keeping cinemas a unique experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinemas need to become comfortable meeting spots if they want to survive the interest in german movies , however , is n't enough to make up for the rest of the branch 's falling profits , and germany 's 1,845 theaters need to re-evaluate their marketing strategies as it gets easier to download movies from the internet and the time between a film 's theater launch and dvd release shortens .
" film rental companies and producers have tapped a second source of income in dvds , clearly to the detriment of the cinema business , " hans-joachim flebbe of the cinemaxx theater chain told the german trade magazine filmecho / filmwoche .
for cinemas to survive as more than part of a studio marketing strategy , they will have to continue changing from dark rooms with gum-covered aisles to places people want to spend more than 90 minutes at a time .
" cinemas need to offer more than ' just ' screens and become meeting spots for people that offer a unique experience , " he explained .
" there is no home cinema or other place that can duplicate being in a movie theater .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2005 german films buck cinematic decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's hollywood blockbusters have been putting germans to sleep germany 's best actors and directors have plenty to thank viewers for in their speeches at friday night ’ s german film prize ceremony .
though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .
hollywood blockbusters disappoint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood blockbusters did n't bring out the expected crowds as the quality of german movies improves and this year 's hollywood blockbusters , like " star wars iii : revenge of the sixth , " fail to bring relief to theater owners , some may want to begin questioning what they put on their screens .
" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .
" these types of films existed before , but they were more academic and analytical . "
changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .
as the population ages , its viewing habits seem to be becoming more sophisticated .
german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .
" the public is no longer in the 12 to 29 age category that multiplexes appeal to . "
keeping cinemas a unique experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinemas need to become comfortable meeting spots if they want to survive the interest in german movies , however , is n't enough to make up for the rest of the branch 's falling profits , and germany 's 1,845 theaters need to re-evaluate their marketing strategies as it gets easier to download movies from the internet and the time between a film 's theater launch and dvd release shortens .
" film rental companies and producers have tapped a second source of income in dvds , clearly to the detriment of the cinema business , " hans-joachim flebbe of the cinemaxx theater chain told the german trade magazine filmecho / filmwoche .
for cinemas to survive as more than part of a studio marketing strategy , they will have to continue changing from dark rooms with gum-covered aisles to places people want to spend more than 90 minutes at a time .
" cinemas need to offer more than ' just ' screens and become meeting spots for people that offer a unique experience , " he explained .

vienna fears an invasion of foreign students , especially from germany . there were long queues outside vienna 's medical university this week .
some would-be students even camped out overnight .
they wanted to be among the first to enroll for the new university year - and they wanted to beat the germans . " the problem is that everyone 's panicked because of the european court decision that will allow germans in .
everyone wants to enroll as quickly as possible , " one student said . any student who has completed high school in austria has the right to a place at university .
but this right is not extended to students from other eu countries .
they must prove they have a place at a university in their home country before being allowed to study in austria .

vienna fears an invasion of foreign students , especially from germany . there were long queues outside vienna 's medical university this week .
some would-be students even camped out overnight .
they wanted to be among the first to enroll for the new university year - and they wanted to beat the germans . " the problem is that everyone 's panicked because of the european court decision that will allow germans in .
everyone wants to enroll as quickly as possible , " one student said . any student who has completed high school in austria has the right to a place at university .
but this right is not extended to students from other eu countries .
they must prove they have a place at a university in their home country before being allowed to study in austria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 g8 boosts aid but disappoints activists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : g8 leaders pledged to increase aid to africa by $ 50 billion british prime minister blair wrapped up a group of eight summit friday that he described as a bold challenge to terrorist thuggery , but aid activists and environmentalists said the results fell short of what was needed . speaking a day after bombings left london reeling in bloody chaos , blair announced agreement on a package of aid for africa and measures to confront global warming that he said stood in stark contrast to the despair wrought by terrorism . " we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .

" we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .

vienna fears an invasion of foreign students , especially from germany . there were long queues outside vienna 's medical university this week .
some would-be students even camped out overnight .
they wanted to be among the first to enroll for the new university year - and they wanted to beat the germans . " the problem is that everyone 's panicked because of the european court decision that will allow germans in .
everyone wants to enroll as quickly as possible , " one student said . any student who has completed high school in austria has the right to a place at university .
but this right is not extended to students from other eu countries .
they must prove they have a place at a university in their home country before being allowed to study in austria .
that is discrimination and thus unacceptable , the european court of justice ruled thursday . the decision was widely anticipated and austria 's universities expect it will open the gates to a flood of german students .
professor christiana spiel , dean of vienna university 's psychology department and a member of the government 's future commission on education said the fears were well founded .
invading students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think they are very realistic because in germany there are about 13,000 students interested in studying psychology .
however , only 3,000 of them get the opportunity .
so the rest of the 10,000 students … we really expect that some of them - and not so few - will come to austria . " austria expects up to 80,000 german students who failed test to enter german medical , veterinary and economic faculties to try to enroll at austrian universities . " a nation of eight million people can not offer places to study to all those who have been rejected in germany , a nation of 80 million people , " education minister elisabeth gehrer told the kurier newspaper . in response to the ruling , gehrer said she would submit a bill to parliament friday to end unscreened access to universities .
the limitations would concern studies in medicine , veterinary medicine , dentistry , pharmacy and biology .
should the bill be adopted by parliament " university directors will have the possibility to impose entrance exams or a grading semester , " gehrer said . austria is the only european union country that does not regulate access to university studies . a total 210,000 students have enrolled in austrian universities for the 2004/05 semesters , according to official figures . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paving the way for academic excellence germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .

he was also ordered to perform 30 hours of public service in a hospital or retirement home . the sasser worm struck on may 1 , 2004 and in less than a week hit thousands of companies and as many as 18 million computers worldwide , forcing some businesses to shut in order to debug their systems and causing millions of dollars in lost productivity . jaschan gave a full confession on the first day of his trial tuesday on charges of computer sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public administration .
the charges would normally carry a prison sentence of up to five years for an adult . sasser exploited a flaw in certain versions of microsoft 's windows operating systems - windows 2000 , windows server 2003 and windows xp - and forced the computer into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .
it apparently did no lasting harm . the german unit of the software giant welcomed the verdict and said it would pay a $ 250,000 -lrb- 209,000 euro -rrb- reward to unnamed informants who had led to jaschan 's conviction .
reluctant cooperation a computer worm , unlike a virus , does not have to travel through e-mail but can spread by itself to any unprotected computer linked to the internet .
sasser 's victims were as far flung as the european commission in brussels , taiwan 's postal service and australian rail traffic controllers .
us airline delta was forced to cancel several flights and finland 's third-largest bank shut its 130 branch offices in a preventive move to keep the worm from infecting its computers . german prosecutors have only been able to document some 130,000 euros in damage from sasser but computer experts say the true figure is in the millions .
many companies were reluctant to cooperate with the authorities for fear of acknowledging holes in their computer security systems . jaschan , whose parents own a computer service company , now works for a german security software firm called securepoint which specializes in defenses against viruses and worms .
a company representative told afp during the trial jaschan would remain an employee regardless of its outcome . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teen admits to unleashing computer worm a german teenager confessed on the first day of his trial tuesday to creating the internet sasser worm that waylaid millions of computers around the globe last year , a court official said .

opposition leaders have called for stricter anti-terrorism measures , while the ruling coalition says it 's doing enough . two months before germany 's likely early elections , the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for tighter security laws .
" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .
bosbach recalled that a trail from the last such attacks in europe , in madrid in march 2004 , had led to germany .
it was now crucial to close possible security gaps in germany and " consider which acute security measures have to be added . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at the british embassy in berlin has been tightened .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein from the cdu sister party christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said that there was no indication of any pending attacks .

german interior minister otto schily reiterated that the country remains under threat by extremists .
" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .
german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .

" they pointed to islamic terrorists , who do not shy away from killing as many people as possible to spread the maximum possible fear , " said freiberg .
no cause for panic , but for caution the green 's parliamentary leader volker beck said the existing security laws were adequate .
he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .

open societies are always exposed to terrorist danger . "

but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .
" we know that terrorists like these select soft targets for their murderous activities , " said schily .

they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .

while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .

he was also ordered to perform 30 hours of public service in a hospital or retirement home . the sasser worm struck on may 1 , 2004 and in less than a week hit thousands of companies and as many as 18 million computers worldwide , forcing some businesses to shut in order to debug their systems and causing millions of dollars in lost productivity . jaschan gave a full confession on the first day of his trial tuesday on charges of computer sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public administration .
the charges would normally carry a prison sentence of up to five years for an adult . sasser exploited a flaw in certain versions of microsoft 's windows operating systems - windows 2000 , windows server 2003 and windows xp - and forced the computer into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .
it apparently did no lasting harm . the german unit of the software giant welcomed the verdict and said it would pay a $ 250,000 -lrb- 209,000 euro -rrb- reward to unnamed informants who had led to jaschan 's conviction .
reluctant cooperation a computer worm , unlike a virus , does not have to travel through e-mail but can spread by itself to any unprotected computer linked to the internet .
sasser 's victims were as far flung as the european commission in brussels , taiwan 's postal service and australian rail traffic controllers .
us airline delta was forced to cancel several flights and finland 's third-largest bank shut its 130 branch offices in a preventive move to keep the worm from infecting its computers . german prosecutors have only been able to document some 130,000 euros in damage from sasser but computer experts say the true figure is in the millions .
many companies were reluctant to cooperate with the authorities for fear of acknowledging holes in their computer security systems . jaschan , whose parents own a computer service company , now works for a german security software firm called securepoint which specializes in defenses against viruses and worms .
a company representative told afp during the trial jaschan would remain an employee regardless of its outcome . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de teen admits to unleashing computer worm a german teenager confessed on the first day of his trial tuesday to creating the internet sasser worm that waylaid millions of computers around the globe last year , a court official said .

opposition leaders have called for stricter anti-terrorism measures , while the ruling coalition says it 's doing enough . two months before germany 's likely early elections , the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for tighter security laws .
" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .
bosbach recalled that a trail from the last such attacks in europe , in madrid in march 2004 , had led to germany .
it was now crucial to close possible security gaps in germany and " consider which acute security measures have to be added . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at the british embassy in berlin has been tightened .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein from the cdu sister party christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said that there was no indication of any pending attacks .
" but an abstract increase in danger is self-evident , " beckstein told german television zdf .
german interior minister otto schily reiterated that the country remains under threat by extremists .
" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .
german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .
" anyone who questions the security measures and the concept of the police for combating terrorism is endangering the people of our country . "

vienna fears an invasion of foreign students , especially from germany . there were long queues outside vienna 's medical university this week .
some would-be students even camped out overnight .
they wanted to be among the first to enroll for the new university year - and they wanted to beat the germans . " the problem is that everyone 's panicked because of the european court decision that will allow germans in .
everyone wants to enroll as quickly as possible , " one student said . any student who has completed high school in austria has the right to a place at university .
but this right is not extended to students from other eu countries .
they must prove they have a place at a university in their home country before being allowed to study in austria .
that is discrimination and thus unacceptable , the european court of justice ruled thursday . the decision was widely anticipated and austria 's universities expect it will open the gates to a flood of german students .
professor christiana spiel , dean of vienna university 's psychology department and a member of the government 's future commission on education said the fears were well founded .
invading students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think they are very realistic because in germany there are about 13,000 students interested in studying psychology .
however , only 3,000 of them get the opportunity .
so the rest of the 10,000 students … we really expect that some of them - and not so few - will come to austria . " austria expects up to 80,000 german students who failed test to enter german medical , veterinary and economic faculties to try to enroll at austrian universities . " a nation of eight million people can not offer places to study to all those who have been rejected in germany , a nation of 80 million people , " education minister elisabeth gehrer told the kurier newspaper . in response to the ruling , gehrer said she would submit a bill to parliament friday to end unscreened access to universities .
the limitations would concern studies in medicine , veterinary medicine , dentistry , pharmacy and biology .
should the bill be adopted by parliament " university directors will have the possibility to impose entrance exams or a grading semester , " gehrer said . austria is the only european union country that does not regulate access to university studies . a total 210,000 students have enrolled in austrian universities for the 2004/05 semesters , according to official figures . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paving the way for academic excellence germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- june 13 , 2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .

" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .

german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .

though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .

german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .

opposition leaders have called for stricter anti-terrorism measures , while the ruling coalition says it 's doing enough . two months before germany 's likely early elections , the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for tighter security laws .
" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .
bosbach recalled that a trail from the last such attacks in europe , in madrid in march 2004 , had led to germany .
it was now crucial to close possible security gaps in germany and " consider which acute security measures have to be added . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at the british embassy in berlin has been tightened .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein from the cdu sister party christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said that there was no indication of any pending attacks .
" but an abstract increase in danger is self-evident , " beckstein told german television zdf .
german interior minister otto schily reiterated that the country remains under threat by extremists .
" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .
german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .
" anyone who questions the security measures and the concept of the police for combating terrorism is endangering the people of our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist mohammed atta , who flew one of the planes into the world trade center , lived in this street in hamburg according to gdp , there are currently preliminary proceedings in 160 cases against alleged terrorists in germany .
attacks that had been planned in germany could be prevented through the good cooperation with security authorities .
" they pointed to islamic terrorists , who do not shy away from killing as many people as possible to spread the maximum possible fear , " said freiberg .
no cause for panic , but for caution the green 's parliamentary leader volker beck said the existing security laws were adequate .
he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .
" there is no cause for panic , but for caution .
open societies are always exposed to terrorist danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily says germany belongs to the safest countries in the world schily has announced a third security package .
but the likely early elections have put these plans on the back burner .
on a european level , the european union also introduced stricter security measures since september 11 .
but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .
" we know that terrorists like these select soft targets for their murderous activities , " said schily .
" we ca n't protect all soft targets in europe , not all trains , office buildings or discotheques .
it is absolutely impossible .

opposition leaders have called for stricter anti-terrorism measures , while the ruling coalition says it 's doing enough . two months before germany 's likely early elections , the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for tighter security laws .
" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .

german interior minister otto schily reiterated that the country remains under threat by extremists .
" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .

gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .

he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .

but the likely early elections have put these plans on the back burner .

but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .

" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .

german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .

he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .

some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "

" we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "
" another benefit is that though it may be a car from china , it is thoroughly a european automobile : designed by an italian and optimized by porsche , " she added .
" in this sense , it fulfils european needs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiangling motors wants to prove they can build vehicles for the european market three chinese manufacturers export to europe so far .
this week , 200 of the first suv landwind were delivered to the netherlands .
they have reportedly all been sold already .
the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .
without financial support from the government , the landwind would never have been able to drive off the production line in jiangxi province .
the price is decisive europe might still be looking down its nose at chinese cars .
but market observers reckon that the chinese might follow the same road as the japanese , which convinced more and more customers in the long-run with low prices and much technological gadgetry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers ca n't refuse " made in china " if it has the right price tag in times of economic recessions , many a customer will think twice if he can refuse a deal 30 to 50 percent less just because of the " made in china " stamp , said liu juan .
" the price is decisive , " she said .
" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .
if we succeed in achieving the same level of management as our foreign competitors and , at the same time , at chinese prices , then we can certainly beat them . "
china can score in the long-term the ambitious aspirations of chinese manufacturers on foreign markets reflects a change in china 's industrial policies .
in the past 20 years , china has systematically built up its production base by bringing foreign companies like volkswagen or general motors into the country .
estimates show that the production capacities of the chinese automobile industry will triple by 2007 to 15 million cars per year .
this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .
industry experts are of the opinion that the chinese can score mainly with inexpensive models in the compact car sector in the long-term , as they offer good design and technology .
the association of german automobile manufacturers vda is n't worried , though .
vda president bernd gottschalk said that china will not achieve a significant market share in the next five years . kerstin lohse -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cars still stars ... for now in germany , it used to be that you knew you 'd made it in life when you bought your first mercedes .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "
" another benefit is that though it may be a car from china , it is thoroughly a european automobile : designed by an italian and optimized by porsche , " she added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2005 german films buck cinematic decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's hollywood blockbusters have been putting germans to sleep germany 's best actors and directors have plenty to thank viewers for in their speeches at friday night ’ s german film prize ceremony .
though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .
hollywood blockbusters disappoint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood blockbusters did n't bring out the expected crowds as the quality of german movies improves and this year 's hollywood blockbusters , like " star wars iii : revenge of the sixth , " fail to bring relief to theater owners , some may want to begin questioning what they put on their screens .
" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .
" these types of films existed before , but they were more academic and analytical . "
changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .
as the population ages , its viewing habits seem to be becoming more sophisticated .
german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .
" the public is no longer in the 12 to 29 age category that multiplexes appeal to . "
keeping cinemas a unique experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinemas need to become comfortable meeting spots if they want to survive the interest in german movies , however , is n't enough to make up for the rest of the branch 's falling profits , and germany 's 1,845 theaters need to re-evaluate their marketing strategies as it gets easier to download movies from the internet and the time between a film 's theater launch and dvd release shortens .
" film rental companies and producers have tapped a second source of income in dvds , clearly to the detriment of the cinema business , " hans-joachim flebbe of the cinemaxx theater chain told the german trade magazine filmecho / filmwoche .
for cinemas to survive as more than part of a studio marketing strategy , they will have to continue changing from dark rooms with gum-covered aisles to places people want to spend more than 90 minutes at a time .
" cinemas need to offer more than ' just ' screens and become meeting spots for people that offer a unique experience , " he explained .
" there is no home cinema or other place that can duplicate being in a movie theater .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "
" another benefit is that though it may be a car from china , it is thoroughly a european automobile : designed by an italian and optimized by porsche , " she added .

they have reportedly all been sold already .
the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .
without financial support from the government , the landwind would never have been able to drive off the production line in jiangxi province .
the price is decisive europe might still be looking down its nose at chinese cars .
but market observers reckon that the chinese might follow the same road as the japanese , which convinced more and more customers in the long-run with low prices and much technological gadgetry .

" the price is decisive , " she said .
" in the future , we want to increase our competitiveness even further in all sectors : management , production , sales and finances .
if we succeed in achieving the same level of management as our foreign competitors and , at the same time , at chinese prices , then we can certainly beat them . "
china can score in the long-term the ambitious aspirations of chinese manufacturers on foreign markets reflects a change in china 's industrial policies .
in the past 20 years , china has systematically built up its production base by bringing foreign companies like volkswagen or general motors into the country .
estimates show that the production capacities of the chinese automobile industry will triple by 2007 to 15 million cars per year .
this would put it 50 percent above the expected demand .
industry experts are of the opinion that the chinese can score mainly with inexpensive models in the compact car sector in the long-term , as they offer good design and technology .

" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .
there was no expectation that british prime minister tony blair would change his policy on iraq following the london blasts , it said .
" his refusal to be intimidated is a perfect reflection of the sang-froid seen yesterday on the streets of the london capital , " liberation said .
" an absence of panic and an impressive composure is the measure of a people whose spirit of resistance we have become familiar with since at least 1940 . "
meanwhile france 's main sports daily l 'equipe broke with tradition by splashing world news onto its front page .
its banner headline " everyone behind london " against a black background was in sharp contrast to wednesday 's headline " why london ? " which referred to the decision to award the 2012 olympics to the british capital rather than paris . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe have beefed up security following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2005 german films buck cinematic decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's hollywood blockbusters have been putting germans to sleep germany 's best actors and directors have plenty to thank viewers for in their speeches at friday night ’ s german film prize ceremony .
though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .
hollywood blockbusters disappoint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood blockbusters did n't bring out the expected crowds as the quality of german movies improves and this year 's hollywood blockbusters , like " star wars iii : revenge of the sixth , " fail to bring relief to theater owners , some may want to begin questioning what they put on their screens .
" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .
" these types of films existed before , but they were more academic and analytical . "
changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .
as the population ages , its viewing habits seem to be becoming more sophisticated .
german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .
" the public is no longer in the 12 to 29 age category that multiplexes appeal to . "
keeping cinemas a unique experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinemas need to become comfortable meeting spots if they want to survive the interest in german movies , however , is n't enough to make up for the rest of the branch 's falling profits , and germany 's 1,845 theaters need to re-evaluate their marketing strategies as it gets easier to download movies from the internet and the time between a film 's theater launch and dvd release shortens .
" film rental companies and producers have tapped a second source of income in dvds , clearly to the detriment of the cinema business , " hans-joachim flebbe of the cinemaxx theater chain told the german trade magazine filmecho / filmwoche .
for cinemas to survive as more than part of a studio marketing strategy , they will have to continue changing from dark rooms with gum-covered aisles to places people want to spend more than 90 minutes at a time .
" cinemas need to offer more than ' just ' screens and become meeting spots for people that offer a unique experience , " he explained .

he was also ordered to perform 30 hours of public service in a hospital or retirement home . the sasser worm struck on may 1 , 2004 and in less than a week hit thousands of companies and as many as 18 million computers worldwide , forcing some businesses to shut in order to debug their systems and causing millions of dollars in lost productivity . jaschan gave a full confession on the first day of his trial tuesday on charges of computer sabotage , data manipulation and disruption of public administration .
the charges would normally carry a prison sentence of up to five years for an adult . sasser exploited a flaw in certain versions of microsoft 's windows operating systems - windows 2000 , windows server 2003 and windows xp - and forced the computer into an unstoppable pattern of shutting down , then rebooting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 shaken european press puts continent on alert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british papers responded with a mixture of sorrow and defiance europe 's press reacted with horror friday to the string of terrorist attacks in london , which left at least 37 people dead .
some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .
there was no expectation that british prime minister tony blair would change his policy on iraq following the london blasts , it said .
" his refusal to be intimidated is a perfect reflection of the sang-froid seen yesterday on the streets of the london capital , " liberation said .
" an absence of panic and an impressive composure is the measure of a people whose spirit of resistance we have become familiar with since at least 1940 . "
meanwhile france 's main sports daily l 'equipe broke with tradition by splashing world news onto its front page .
its banner headline " everyone behind london " against a black background was in sharp contrast to wednesday 's headline " why london ? " which referred to the decision to award the 2012 olympics to the british capital rather than paris . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe have beefed up security following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .
-lrb- july 7 , 2005 -rrb- terrorism in london sidelines g8 summit the world 's most powerful leaders had planned to start talks in scotland on thursday on aid to africa and climate change , but the meeting was brutally overshadowed by a coordinated terrorist attack on london .

" we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .

while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .

environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system .

that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere .

" we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .

bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said . " the agreement lacks a clear acknowledgement of the urgent need for action and fails to state any significant steps g8 leaders will take to tackle climate change , " added friends of the earth international . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

" we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .

some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .
spain strongly condemned the " savage attacks " in london and reached out to the british people .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bombings in spain last year also hit the atocha railway station in madrid it recalled similar train bombings in march 2004 in madrid , which killed 191 people and injured 1,900 in what was spain 's worst such attack .
the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "
bombers will not break britain 's resolve britain 's newspapers responded friday to the bomb attacks in london with a mixture of sorrow and blitz-like defiance , vowing never to bow to terrorists .
in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .
" despite the shock , horror and outrage , the calm shown in london was exemplary , " the editorial said .
" the terrorists have only strengthened the resolve of britain and its people . "
" our spirit will never be broken , " read the front-page of the sun , the nation 's best-selling tabloid .
neither nazi german bombing nor irish republican army attacks had broken the city 's spirit , it said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the edgware road station in london was also a target thursday 's blasts , britain 's worst peacetime attack , would only " make this nation ever more determined that those who violate our way of life must never win , " the sun said .
" if the terrorists want a fight , by god , we 'll give it them , " the newspaper vowed in its editorial .
london 's daily telegraph picked up the theme that the london attacks were a warning for other western nations .
" once again , they have demonstrated that they can strike at the heart of a major western power , " the paper said .
britain 's impressive composure the french left-wing liberation daily praised the calm reaction of londoners to the terrorist blasts .
there was no expectation that british prime minister tony blair would change his policy on iraq following the london blasts , it said .
" his refusal to be intimidated is a perfect reflection of the sang-froid seen yesterday on the streets of the london capital , " liberation said .
" an absence of panic and an impressive composure is the measure of a people whose spirit of resistance we have become familiar with since at least 1940 . "
meanwhile france 's main sports daily l 'equipe broke with tradition by splashing world news onto its front page .
its banner headline " everyone behind london " against a black background was in sharp contrast to wednesday 's headline " why london ? " which referred to the decision to award the 2012 olympics to the british capital rather than paris . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe raises security after london attack governments across europe have beefed up security following a series of deadly rush-hour bombings in london , with police stepping up patrols in airports , rail stations and public transport systems .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.07.2005 german films buck cinematic decline großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this year 's hollywood blockbusters have been putting germans to sleep germany 's best actors and directors have plenty to thank viewers for in their speeches at friday night ’ s german film prize ceremony .
though fewer people are going to the movies , local films are doing better than ever . it started off as a tough year for germany 's film industry - attendance has dropped 18 percent and film revenues have fallen 17 percent to 332 million euros -lrb- $ 396 million -rrb- in the first half of 2005 , according to a nielsen edi survey .
but it 's not german movies that are to blame , as interest in local productions has increased .
" amazingly , german films are experiencing a growth of 11 percent compared to the drop seen in the rest of the industry , " said andreas kramer of the association of german cinemas .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german films , like " sophie scholl , " were among the few bright spots on germany 's movie screens last year germany had 121 new productions , putting more premiers than ever on local screens , which was second only to the united states ' 179 releases in germany .
after two years of falling attendance rates , 152.5 million people bought movie tickets , a five percent improvement over 2003 , and revenues also went up five percent to nearly 893 million euros , according to the german federal film board .
but the data is slightly misleading as 2003 was a terrible year for german cinemas .
when compared to banner year 2001 , attendance was down 12 percent and revenues dropped by 67 million euros .
that did n't keep germany 's culture minister christina weiss from proclaiming that " german films are looking better than ever before " and calling friday 's awards a celebration of new german cinema , which had a record 24 percent of the german film market .
hollywood blockbusters disappoint bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hollywood blockbusters did n't bring out the expected crowds as the quality of german movies improves and this year 's hollywood blockbusters , like " star wars iii : revenge of the sixth , " fail to bring relief to theater owners , some may want to begin questioning what they put on their screens .
" i do not think hollywood 's productions match the german public 's taste , " kramer added .
" that can be seen by looking at the blockbusters that are not bringing in the expected attendance numbers . "
movies that deal with recent german history , such as " the downfall " and " sophie scholl , " both films that deal with germany 's nazi past , are doing particularly well , according to jürgen keiper of the german film institute in frankfurt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " downfall " and other films dealing with germany 's past are especially popular at the moment " there 's an interest in films that deal with german historical reality in a more experimental , modern way , " he said .
" these types of films existed before , but they were more academic and analytical . "
changing tastes and viewers these are also the films viewers can only get from german movie makers , as few films from the united states or other european countries are set in germany , keiper said .
germans ' taste in films may also be dictated by demographic changes .
as the population ages , its viewing habits seem to be becoming more sophisticated .
german productions , like this year 's hit " barfuss , " do a much better job at appealing to an aging german movie public .
" when you 're 40 years old you do n't want to see the same arnold schwarzenegger movie you did when you were 12 or 14 , " kramer said .
" the public is no longer in the 12 to 29 age category that multiplexes appeal to . "
keeping cinemas a unique experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cinemas need to become comfortable meeting spots if they want to survive the interest in german movies , however , is n't enough to make up for the rest of the branch 's falling profits , and germany 's 1,845 theaters need to re-evaluate their marketing strategies as it gets easier to download movies from the internet and the time between a film 's theater launch and dvd release shortens .
" film rental companies and producers have tapped a second source of income in dvds , clearly to the detriment of the cinema business , " hans-joachim flebbe of the cinemaxx theater chain told the german trade magazine filmecho / filmwoche .
for cinemas to survive as more than part of a studio marketing strategy , they will have to continue changing from dark rooms with gum-covered aisles to places people want to spend more than 90 minutes at a time .
" cinemas need to offer more than ' just ' screens and become meeting spots for people that offer a unique experience , " he explained .
" there is no home cinema or other place that can duplicate being in a movie theater .

opposition leaders have called for stricter anti-terrorism measures , while the ruling coalition says it 's doing enough . two months before germany 's likely early elections , the conservative opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- have called for tighter security laws .
" we have to close the security gaps and ca n't wait until the next legislative period , " cdu interior affairs expert wolfgang bosbach told dortmund daily ruhr nachrichten .
bosbach recalled that a trail from the last such attacks in europe , in madrid in march 2004 , had led to germany .
it was now crucial to close possible security gaps in germany and " consider which acute security measures have to be added . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security at the british embassy in berlin has been tightened .
bavaria 's interior minister günther beckstein from the cdu sister party christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- said that there was no indication of any pending attacks .
" but an abstract increase in danger is self-evident , " beckstein told german television zdf .
german interior minister otto schily reiterated that the country remains under threat by extremists .
" unfortunately , we have to reckon that these groups also have their sights on us , " schily told zdf .
german police want more leeway the german police labor union gdp said measures to battle terrorism in germany had to be increased .
gdp head konrad freiberg called for a new anti-terror package , which would include a leniency program , a central anti-terror databank and long-term storage of telephone connections .
" the terror attacks in london are renewed evidence that european capitals continue to be extremely in danger from international terrorism , " said freiberg in a statement .
" anyone who questions the security measures and the concept of the police for combating terrorism is endangering the people of our country . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terrorist mohammed atta , who flew one of the planes into the world trade center , lived in this street in hamburg according to gdp , there are currently preliminary proceedings in 160 cases against alleged terrorists in germany .
attacks that had been planned in germany could be prevented through the good cooperation with security authorities .
" they pointed to islamic terrorists , who do not shy away from killing as many people as possible to spread the maximum possible fear , " said freiberg .
no cause for panic , but for caution the green 's parliamentary leader volker beck said the existing security laws were adequate .
he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .
" it has done everything imaginable to prevent such attacks , " said hacker in a statement .
" there is no cause for panic , but for caution .
open societies are always exposed to terrorist danger . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : federal interior minister otto schily says germany belongs to the safest countries in the world schily has announced a third security package .
but the likely early elections have put these plans on the back burner .
on a european level , the european union also introduced stricter security measures since september 11 .
but schily said the expectations on the bloc should n't be too high .
" we know that terrorists like these select soft targets for their murderous activities , " said schily .
" we ca n't protect all soft targets in europe , not all trains , office buildings or discotheques .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 08.07.2005 austria fears flood of german students großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are notoriously underfunded and overcrowded the european court of justice ruled thursday that austrian universities may not restrict students from other eu countries from studying in austria .
vienna fears an invasion of foreign students , especially from germany . there were long queues outside vienna 's medical university this week .
some would-be students even camped out overnight .
they wanted to be among the first to enroll for the new university year - and they wanted to beat the germans . " the problem is that everyone 's panicked because of the european court decision that will allow germans in .
everyone wants to enroll as quickly as possible , " one student said . any student who has completed high school in austria has the right to a place at university .
but this right is not extended to students from other eu countries .
they must prove they have a place at a university in their home country before being allowed to study in austria .
that is discrimination and thus unacceptable , the european court of justice ruled thursday . the decision was widely anticipated and austria 's universities expect it will open the gates to a flood of german students .
professor christiana spiel , dean of vienna university 's psychology department and a member of the government 's future commission on education said the fears were well founded .
invading students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think they are very realistic because in germany there are about 13,000 students interested in studying psychology .
however , only 3,000 of them get the opportunity .
so the rest of the 10,000 students … we really expect that some of them - and not so few - will come to austria . " austria expects up to 80,000 german students who failed test to enter german medical , veterinary and economic faculties to try to enroll at austrian universities .

the highly contentious issue of european union and us agricultural export subsidies , which harm the interests of african producers , is expected to be left to the world trade organization to resolve . compromise on global warming ? the g8 has meanwhile completed a declaration and action plan on global warming that builds a bridge between the united states and its partners , according to french president jacques chirac . " the agreement which we are set to reach is an important agreement , even if it does n't go as far as we would have wanted , " chirac told a press conference .
" it restores dialogue between the seven -lrb- g8 -rrb- kyoto members and the united states , " he said . the united states is the loner in the global effort to combat greenhouse gases - the byproduct of fossil fuels that trap the sun 's heat , drive up earth 's surface temperature and damage its delicate system .
bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said .

blair will return to london to deal with the crisis and is reported to be returning to the summit later in the evening .
standing second left is u.s. president george w. bush and right is french president jacques chirac .
standing far left is south africa 's president thabo mbeki .
-lrb- ap photo / charlie bibby , financial times -rrb- no headway is likely on trade concessions , the third pillar of the blair plan .
the highly contentious issue of european union and us agricultural export subsidies , which harm the interests of african producers , is expected to be left to the world trade organization to resolve . compromise on global warming ? the g8 has meanwhile completed a declaration and action plan on global warming that builds a bridge between the united states and its partners , according to french president jacques chirac . " the agreement which we are set to reach is an important agreement , even if it does n't go as far as we would have wanted , " chirac told a press conference .
" it restores dialogue between the seven -lrb- g8 -rrb- kyoto members and the united states , " he said . the united states is the loner in the global effort to combat greenhouse gases - the byproduct of fossil fuels that trap the sun 's heat , drive up earth 's surface temperature and damage its delicate system .
bush has vowed never to ratify the un kyoto protocol , which requires industrialized countries to trim their output of these gases by a 2008-2012 timetable compared with a 1990 benchmark . bush declared the targets would be ruinously costly for the oil-dependent us economy and unfair because fast-growing populous countries such as china and india are not part of the targeted emissions cuts . the compromise draft communiqué , said chirac , has only a couple of references to kyoto .
but he said it would acknowledge climate change as " a reality " and say " we have to act immediately " to combat the problem . " we have noticed a shift in the american position , " said chirac , who described this as " a major step ... towards an improvement . " a " missed opportunity " but angry environmentalists insist that political action is lagging far behind what is needed to avert potentially catastrophic damage to the climate system . the g8 deal is " a major missed opportunity to tackle dangerous climate change , " greenpeace said . " the agreement lacks a clear acknowledgement of the urgent need for action and fails to state any significant steps g8 leaders will take to tackle climate change , " added friends of the earth international . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe reacts to london bombings the explosions that rocked london on thursday morning also sent shock waves across europe , with governments stepping up security and offering their condolences to the people of britain .

in recent years , german car manufacturers saw just one market of the future : china .
but things may turn around soon , as chinese auto producers start looking to the european market . german companies like volkswagen , bmw and daimlerchrysler have all invested heavily in china , building new factories there in order to benefit from the country 's automobile boom .
yet china could become a worry to european carmakers in the future .
the chinese are not buying as many compact cars as german companies hoped for .
and now , chinese carmakers are beginning to export inexpensive vehicles to europe .
the first shipment of the zhonghua , a classic notchback sedan , is expected to arrive in the german port of bremerhaven this fall .
with the caliber of a mercedes-benz e-class , the five-door model from china has got a smaller price tag at under 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 23,875 -rrb- .
the sedan built by car manufacturer brilliance , the joint-venture partner of bmw in the northeastern chinese city of shenyang , already got a positive reception at the automobile trade fair in leipzig earlier this year .
an appealing car , with an exotic touch brilliance wants to export 3,500 cars to europe this year .
in the coming years , this figure is supposed to continually increase by 20 to 30 percent .
" one of the benefits of the zhonghua is the fact that the car is from china and therefore presents a new face on the european market , " said brilliance 's export manager liu juan .
" it 's very appealing , with a hint of an exotic touch . "
" another benefit is that though it may be a car from china , it is thoroughly a european automobile : designed by an italian and optimized by porsche , " she added .
" in this sense , it fulfils european needs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jiangling motors wants to prove they can build vehicles for the european market three chinese manufacturers export to europe so far .
this week , 200 of the first suv landwind were delivered to the netherlands .
they have reportedly all been sold already .
the model by jiangling motors , which ford also has a stake in , costs between 17,000 and 18,000 euros - half of the next affordable competitor .
beijing 's status mentality but why should china go to europe and the united states when international manufacturers currently have one goal only : china , the fasting growing car market in the world ?
the answer is simple : sales difficulties in their own country and the enormous status mentality of the chinese government .
beijing wants to prove to the world that it can now build cars suitable for the world market .
without financial support from the government , the landwind would never have been able to drive off the production line in jiangxi province .
the price is decisive europe might still be looking down its nose at chinese cars .
but market observers reckon that the chinese might follow the same road as the japanese , which convinced more and more customers in the long-run with low prices and much technological gadgetry .

some media warned that the atrocities represented a threat far beyond britain 's capital . several german papers saw the london attacks as aimed against non-muslims in general more than simply its british targets .
" do n't be fooled by the message of revenge , " said the conservative die welt daily in its friday edition .
the attacks in london were not acts of punishment against the british " crusader government , " which was being punished for its participation in the wars in afghanistan and iraq , it said .
in fact , the paper wrote , the islamists " are following an ancestral eschatology , which distinguishes between the good faithful and the sub-human deniers of allah 's truth , unworthy of living , who are to be converted , subjugated or killed . "
" the attacks on london do nothing to change the fact that germany has for a long time been one of the possible targets for terrorism , " the center-left berliner zeitung said .
the business daily handelsblatt said it was repugnant that the attacks occurred as g8 leaders were meeting in britain deciding to make a great effort in the fight against poverty .
" this shows the extent to which islamist terrorism is divorced from western concepts , " it said .
londoners a model of courage and dignity spain 's el mundo stressed that the spanish government had been placed on " a state of alert " following the london attacks .

the paris-edited international herald tribune -lrb- iht -rrb- said in an editorial that it was impossible to miss the twin ironies of thursday 's horrific bombings in london .
" terrorists struck just as leaders of the major industrialized nations gathered in scotland to talk about alleviating the misery of poverty around the world , and right after londoners celebrated winning the proud right to stage the olympics , the greatest quadrennial display of international understanding , " the iht said .
" the familiarity of these scenes does nothing to mitigate the pain of those who have been injured by the unforgivable crimes of bombings directed at innocents , or who lost loved ones in the attacks , " the iht said .
" londoners know terrorism well from their long struggle with the ira , and their response yesterday was a model of courage and dignity . "

in an editorial , the times expressed " revulsion and resolve " and called for extra vigilance .

he said there should be clarification on the london attacks before further measures are discussed for germany .
" whoever wants to say already today what should follow from london simply wants to capitalize politically on these horrible attacks , " beck told the daily berliner zeitung .
the deputy head of the social democrats parliamentary group , hans-joachim hacker , said the ruling center-left government had reacted adequately to the changing threats in the world through two anti-terrorism legislation and several supplementary laws .

they wanted to be among the first to enroll for the new university year - and they wanted to beat the germans . " the problem is that everyone 's panicked because of the european court decision that will allow germans in .
everyone wants to enroll as quickly as possible , " one student said . any student who has completed high school in austria has the right to a place at university .
but this right is not extended to students from other eu countries .
they must prove they have a place at a university in their home country before being allowed to study in austria .
that is discrimination and thus unacceptable , the european court of justice ruled thursday . the decision was widely anticipated and austria 's universities expect it will open the gates to a flood of german students .
professor christiana spiel , dean of vienna university 's psychology department and a member of the government 's future commission on education said the fears were well founded .
invading students bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think they are very realistic because in germany there are about 13,000 students interested in studying psychology .
however , only 3,000 of them get the opportunity .
so the rest of the 10,000 students … we really expect that some of them - and not so few - will come to austria . " austria expects up to 80,000 german students who failed test to enter german medical , veterinary and economic faculties to try to enroll at austrian universities . " a nation of eight million people can not offer places to study to all those who have been rejected in germany , a nation of 80 million people , " education minister elisabeth gehrer told the kurier newspaper . in response to the ruling , gehrer said she would submit a bill to parliament friday to end unscreened access to universities .
the limitations would concern studies in medicine , veterinary medicine , dentistry , pharmacy and biology .
should the bill be adopted by parliament " university directors will have the possibility to impose entrance exams or a grading semester , " gehrer said . austria is the only european union country that does not regulate access to university studies . a total 210,000 students have enrolled in austrian universities for the 2004/05 semesters , according to official figures . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de paving the way for academic excellence germany 's ruling coalition and state governments have agreed to free up nearly 2 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- in additional funds for university research .
the move is hoped to reinvigorate a stagnating university system .
-lrb- june 24 , 2005 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- june 13 , 2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair stands in the centre , as g8 leaders pose together , at the end of the g8 summit in gleneagles , scotland , friday july 8 , 2005 .
they are , from left , us president george w. bush .
canadian prime minister paul martin , french president jacques chirac , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi , blair , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , russian president vladimir putin , eu president jose emanual barroso , and german chancellor gerhard schröder the prime minister did not make clear over what period the aid would be delivered , but the draft anti-poverty plan discussed ahead of the summit mentioned an extra $ 50 billion in aid a year by 2010 . nor did blair specify how much debt was cancelled but g8 finance ministers agreed last month to immediately write off $ 40 billion to 18 of the world 's poorest nations , most of them in africa . blair also said there was a plan for a new peacekeeping force in africa in exchange for the commitment of african leaders to democracy , good governance and the rule of law . " all of this does not change the world tomorrow , it is a beginning , not an end , " he said .
" none of this today will match the same ghastly impact of the cruelty of terror . " farm subsidies g8 leaders also called for the abolition of agricultural export subsidies by an unspecified " credible end date , " according to the text of an expected final summit communique . bildunterschrift : " we are also committed to eliminating all forms of export subsidies and establishing disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect by a credible end date , " said the text , obtained by afp on friday .
the statement was to be officially released later in the day . it said britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states were also " committed to substantially reducing trade-distorting domestic support and substantially improving market access . " developing countries , notably those in africa , maintain that government assistance to agriculture in the industrialized world prevents their farmers from competing effectively on international markets and lowers prices . eliminating such subsidies has been a key element in a " marshall plan " for africa that summit host , british prime minister tony blair , has been advocating at the summit . britain to host climate conference on the number two topic of the summit - climate change - blair said britain will host a conference in november on establishing a " dialogue " between the world 's eight major industrialized countries and emerging nations on tackling global warming . " we have agreed a process with a plan of action that will initiate a new dialogue between the g8 countries and the emerging economies of the world to slow down and then in time reverse the rise of harmful greenhouse gas emissions , " blair said . the meeting will take place on nov.1 in britain , blair said , without giving further details . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 vows to finish work under terror cloud group of eight leaders will try to put the horror of the london terrorist attacks behind them friday as they wrap up a three-day summit with long-awaited statements on combating poverty in africa and global warming .

" we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .
far from enough but in an initial reaction , non-governmental organizations were less than impressed . the world development movement , oxfam international and action aid all said the projected aid increase would bring development assistance to just under $ 130 billion in the next five years , short of the millenium development goals of $ 180 billion . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in edinburgh the un goals , approved in 2000 , call for the proportion of people living on less than a dollar a day to be halved by 2015 .
max lawson of oxfam said the g8 initiative here was " a step forward but it will come too late . " action aid said the announcement was more bad news than good as it was insufficient to meet the needs of poor countries . " g8 leaders have promised 50 billion dollars more in aid by 2010 .
while aid increases are welcome , this is too little , and it 's too late for the 50 million children who will die between now and 2010 , " it said in a statement .
" if they are serious about making poverty history , they should announce 50 billion in aid now , not in five years time . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor schröder met with bono -lrb- right -rrb- and bob geldof -lrb- left -rrb- a gentler assessment came from pop star bono , who with fellow singer bob geldof organized a global rock concert in nine countries last weekend that drew a million people to spur the g8 into action .
" the world spoke and the politicians listened , " he said .
" now , if the world keeps an eye out , they will keep their promises . "
environmental challenge on the environment , the g8 characterized global warming as a " serious and long-term challenge " and said it was in part caused by " the increased need and use of energy from fossil fuels , and other human activities . " along with an action plan to combat global warming , the documents marked the g8 's strongest acknowledgement so far of the cause and scale of global warming , a phenomenon that has shifted from the wings to the centre of the world 's political stage in less than a quarter-century . but they also fell miles short of the demands from scientists and green groups who had demanded a deadline and a target for cuts in the fossil-fuel gases that are warming earth 's atmosphere and disrupting its climate system . " thanks to the bush administration , the world 's biggest polluters have given little hope to those already suffering from climate change , especially those in africa who will be hit hardest , " said wwf 's jennifer morgan .
" technology is important but without real targets to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions , it is simply not enough . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesters were dragged by police from the motorway near gleneagles on wednesday the three-day summit sparked violent protests wednesday by hundreds of anti-capitalist activists , some of whom tried unsuccessfully to breach a security fence surrounding the summit venue - a posh and secluded golf resort in the scottish countryside .
that hurdle overcome , blair on thursday greeted his colleagues on a splendid early summer morning .
london bombs cast shadow but the mood quickly darkened on reports of a coordinated terror attack on london 's transport system , prompting the prime minister to rush back to the capital , leaving his counterparts to carry on with the talks . he returned eight hours later . according to german chancellor gerhard schröder , gleneagles had by then become " another summit " with " a different atmosphere . " a high-ranking european official added : " the summit has been totally overshadowed by the drama in london .

" we stand today in the shadow of terrorism .
but it will not obscure what we came here to achieve , " he declared .
" the purpose of terrorism is not only to kill and maim the innocent .
it is to put despair and anger and hatred in people 's hearts .
it is by its savagery designed to cover all conventional politics in darkness ...
" there is no hope in terrorism , nor any future in it that is worth living .
so we are offering today this contrast to the politics of terror . " the leaders of britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , russia and the united states endorsed measures they said would boost annual development aid to poor countries in africa and elsewhere by $ 50 billion -lrb- 42 billion euros -rrb- by 2010 .
they also agreed to cut trade-distorting farm subsidies - albeit by an unspecified date - and to provide aid worth $ 3 billion to the palestinian authority .
blair said a conference would be held in britain on november 1 to discuss steps to reduce global warming .

" we have to have ... maximum consideration of the risk of another attack and that 's why our total effort today is focused on identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice , " said home secretary charles clarke . british officials were examining a claim of responsibility by a previously unknown group calling itself the organization of al qaeda jihad in europe , the government said on friday . in a statement posted on the internet - but which has not been authenticated - the group said the attacks were " in response to the massacres carried out by britain in iraq and afghanistan . "
they threatened similar attacks against italy , denmark and other " crusader " states with troops in iraq and afghanistan . " the web site claim is a serious one , so we will look at that very closely but we have n't eliminated any alternative explanations .
we 're looking at everything very widely , " british home secretary charles clarke told sky news television . suicide attack speculation although anti-terrorist investigators said it was too early to tell , several british newspapers speculated that the attack on the number 30 bus had been the work of a suicide bomber .
andy hayman of the london police specialist operations branch , said the bombs had held 10 lbs .
-lrb- 4.5 kg -rrb- of explosives and could have been carried around in a backpack , reuters reported .

he told the bbc he was near liverpool street station when the first of the four blasts was reported .
mr giuliani described the explosions as " dastardly , cowardly acts " .
" the people of london should know that they have , in the people of new york , people who understand what they are going through , " he said .
" my heart goes out to the people affected by this , it reminds me so much of september 11 , " he said .
mr giuliani was praised for taking to the streets to reassure new yorkers immediately after the 9/11 attacks .
his opposite number , london mayor ken livingstone , is on his way back from singapore where he was part of the team which secured the 2012 olympics .
mr giuliani said no nation had offered the us more support after the 9/11 attacks than britain - and now that britain had been attacked , it was the turn of the us to offer its ally support .
people in london have always been remarkable - they were our inspiration on september 11 when we thought about how they reacted during the blitz rudolph giuliani in pictures : us solidarity " i was right near liverpool -lrb- street -rrb- station when the first bomb went off and was notified of it , " he said .
" it was ... very eerie to be right there again when one of these attacks takes place . "
mr giuliani , whose eight-year tenure as mayor of new york will be best remembered for his heart-felt response to the attacks on the world trade centre , drew parallels between events on both sides of the atlantic .
he said " the idea of a surprise attack " , as well as " innocent people just going to work being injured and killed " , meant the attacks bore similarities .
' remarkable ' londoners he said new yorkers recovered from the september 11 attacks and predicted that londoners would do the same .
the former mayor said the best way to react to such attacks is " to stand up to them and do everything we can to support the people that were affected by it - but not to let these terrorists affect our way of life " .
he went on : " people in london have always been remarkable .
they were our inspiration on september 11 when we thought about how they reacted to the blitz in 1940 , and how they went through something far worse than we would ever have to go through .
" it is n't surprising that their children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren have that same resolute response to this attack . "

among them are two veterans , who are celebrating a 62-year friendship which began when they left wales to take part in the d-day landings .
they met on the platform of bargoed railway station .
on sunday emrys davies and bert dawe will march side by side again in a tribute parade in cardiff city centre .
in 1943 , aged 18 , they were full of youthful expectation when they left the security of their homes in the south wales valleys as members of the welch regiment .
mr davies and mr dawe - now in their 70s - were new recruits , joining up for what were to be the last days of world war ii .
they had been members of the home guard , so were already in uniform as they set off for a training camp in kent .
at herne bay they volunteered as infantry signalman , hoping for an easy life .
they were to be disappointed .
" we thought it would be a good skive , " said mr davies .
" we did n't realise that when we went across to normandy we were prime targets , because the germans were knocking-off officers , ncos and signallers . "
by the time the two saw active service it was june 1944 and thousands of allied troops had started advancing on germany .
but on the beaches of northern france , the full horror of the war became clear .
" there were terrible , terrible sights , " said mr dawe .
" our mates being killed - blown to pieces .
" people say you want to forget that - but how can you forget ? ! "
but they were not daunted by the deaths of those around them .
" to us , at that age , we were immortal , " said mr davies " we thought , ' it ca n't happen to us ' . "
but death came very close to mr dawe , when he and his sergeant came under fire .
" a lot of shell fragments went through him and into me , " he said .
" i was trying to comfort him , but he died in my arms . "
mr davies marched on to hamburg , eventually leaving the army in 1947 .
the two young men carried a mascot - a saucepan - with them on their travels across europe .
but after the war , the little pan from llanelli went missing .
it eventually turned up at a military base in cardiff .
" it was found in the basement of maindee barracks , amongst a lot of other discarded silverware . " said mr davies .
" people did n't know the importance of it .
" but i want this saucepan known to people from all over the world , because this is the famous ' sospan fach ' . "
on sunday the two veterans will march together again , parading through the streets of cardiff to mark the end of world war ii , 60 years ago .

eyewitnesses tell what they saw and heard at blast sites around the capital .
michael henning , liverpool street we travelled out into the tunnel and not long after we set out all i saw was yellow light and what appeared to be silver lines in front of my eyes - which turned out to be the glass .
i was being twisted and thrown to the ground .
i thought i was n't going to get out of this - whatever it was - i just did n't know .
i thought that was it when it went all so dark .
then i touched my hand to my face and felt the blood and knew it was n't all over yet .
victim describes blast i am an extremely lucky man , i am very lucky indeed , especially as i saw what happened in the next carriage .
the bomb must have been within 10 feet of me but that carriage took most of the blast and we were just showered in glass .
our carriage was smoke-filled , there was lots of dust , there was lots of panic .
we could hear the screams from the carriage where the bomb had gone off - they were trapped in twisted metal .
the doors would n't open ... then we saw this orange jacket which turned out to be one of the drivers .
we decided we were going to walk out down the middle of the train .
tanya alleyway , liverpool street everybody was absolutely terrified .
you could hear the screaming from the carriages in front , because that was where the explosion had happened , and there was lots of injured people there .

our carriage was smoke-filled , there was lots of dust , there was lots of panic .
we could hear the screams from the carriage where the bomb had gone off - they were trapped in twisted metal .
the doors would n't open ... then we saw this orange jacket which turned out to be one of the drivers .

eyewitnesses tell what they saw and heard at blast sites around the capital .
michael henning , liverpool street we travelled out into the tunnel and not long after we set out all i saw was yellow light and what appeared to be silver lines in front of my eyes - which turned out to be the glass .
i was being twisted and thrown to the ground .
i thought i was n't going to get out of this - whatever it was - i just did n't know .
i thought that was it when it went all so dark .
then i touched my hand to my face and felt the blood and knew it was n't all over yet .
victim describes blast i am an extremely lucky man , i am very lucky indeed , especially as i saw what happened in the next carriage .
the bomb must have been within 10 feet of me but that carriage took most of the blast and we were just showered in glass .
our carriage was smoke-filled , there was lots of dust , there was lots of panic .
we could hear the screams from the carriage where the bomb had gone off - they were trapped in twisted metal .
the doors would n't open ... then we saw this orange jacket which turned out to be one of the drivers .
we decided we were going to walk out down the middle of the train .
tanya alleyway , liverpool street everybody was absolutely terrified .
you could hear the screaming from the carriages in front , because that was where the explosion had happened , and there was lots of injured people there .
nobody knew what was going on .
the driver was trying to communicate with us , but the radio was n't working .
people were trying to open the doors and the windows to let the smoke out and were rocking the train , which already felt like it had come off its rails .
so we were panicking that the train was going to get knocked over .
it was just general chaos .
i thought i was going to die when i saw the flames .
i thought we were going to get engulfed by the flames or get overwhelmed by the smoke .
i really did n't think we were going to get out .
it has n't quite sunk in , i think .
it 's the kind of thing where you see it on the news , but do n't expect to be in it - and i was in it and it was horrible .
john maingay , tavistock square i had just come out of my office to talk to colleagues about the news of an explosion in liverpool street .
literally at that moment there was a huge " boom " outside .
i knew it was a bomb straight away .
there was that smell of an explosion that accompanied it .
i saw lots of debris fly past the window , including one huge chunk .
it must have been the roof of the bus .
all non-medical staff , myself included , were evacuated out the back of the building , while doctors working in the building immediately went to the aid of the casualties .
some were taken into the building and treated .
some of the building was also used as morgue .
i 'm not sure how many died .
david jones , tavistock square suddenly there was this thud , people on the bus said there 's been an explosion behind us and people rushed to the front .
i said to people not to panic , keep calm .
people evacuated our bus .
there was not a lot of fire but there was the smell of an explosion and at that point people wanted to walk away from what they had seen .
there was no glass falling ... there was a thud and the roof had come off .
i suppose , to be honest , my first thought was g8 , olympics , somebody does not want london to celebrate .
unnamed witness , tavistock square i was walking along .
there was a crowd of people around the bus .
the next thing i knew i was on the floor .
there was shed loads of glass raining down .
someone fell on me and someone fell on him .
for a moment i thought i was going to be trampled .
i picked myself up and everyone was running .
there was glass everywhere .
we ran into a building and a security guard was saying 'get in , get in ' .
then the security guard said 'get out ' ... which was a bit scary .
i saw the bus ripped out at the back ... it could n't have been anything else -lsb- but a terrorist attack -rsb- .
belinda seabrook , russell square i was on the bus in front and heard an incredible bang , i turned round and half the double-decker bus was in the air .

it was n't till i got to work that i realised i had a cut on my head and my clothes were covered in dust .
fiona trueman , king 's cross it was about three minutes after we left king 's cross , when there was a massive bang and there was smoke and glass everywhere - i was standing near a window , and i 've still got some in my hair .
in the aftermath of the explosion on a bus in tavistock square strangers recounted to each other what they heard and saw in the aftermath the lights went out , and with the smoke , we could n't breathe , and we sort of cushioned each other during the impact because the compartment was so full .
it felt like a dream , it was surreal .
it was just horrendous , it was like a disaster movie , you ca n't imagine being somewhere like that , you just want to get out .
i kept closing my eyes and thinking of outside .
it was frightening because all the lights had gone out and we did n't hear anything from the driver , so we wondered how he was .
overall i feel lucky , and my thoughts go out to the families of anyone who has died .
arash kazerouni there was a loud bang and the train ground to a halt .

how to reduce cot death risk both partners should reduce smoking during pregnancy babies should be placed on their back to sleep parents should also ensure their baby does not get too hot keep baby 's head uncovered seek medical advice promptly if your baby is unwell in the first six months , a baby should sleep in a cot in the parents ' room do not share a bed with your baby if you smoke , have been drinking or taking drugs or are very tired never sleep with a baby on a chair or an armchair babies should not sleep in their parents ' bed , particularly in the first three months and adults have been warned against falling asleep with a baby on a couch or a chair .
dr mcclure said : " until recently it was thought that bed-sharing was a risk only if parents were smokers .
" our advice to parents is that while it 's fine to have your baby in bed to feed or cuddle , you should put the baby in his or her own cot or crib in your room before you go to sleep . "

the glasgow university study found babies sharing a bed were at risk even if the child was breast-fed and the parent was a non-smoker .
dr john mcclure , chairman of the scottish cot death trust , said parents should only have their babies in bed for a feed or a cuddle .
the research was carried out at the university between 1996 and 2000 .
the charity said cot death could not be prevented but the risk could be reduced if parents followed simple advice .
how to reduce cot death risk both partners should reduce smoking during pregnancy babies should be placed on their back to sleep parents should also ensure their baby does not get too hot keep baby 's head uncovered seek medical advice promptly if your baby is unwell in the first six months , a baby should sleep in a cot in the parents ' room do not share a bed with your baby if you smoke , have been drinking or taking drugs or are very tired never sleep with a baby on a chair or an armchair babies should not sleep in their parents ' bed , particularly in the first three months and adults have been warned against falling asleep with a baby on a couch or a chair .
dr mcclure said : " until recently it was thought that bed-sharing was a risk only if parents were smokers .
" our advice to parents is that while it 's fine to have your baby in bed to feed or cuddle , you should put the baby in his or her own cot or crib in your room before you go to sleep . "
hazel brooke , executive director of the scottish cot death trust , said : " what we do n't want is for parents to avoid bed-sharing but to start sleeping on a couch or a chair with the baby instead - that is extremely unsafe .

research is being carried out by the marine conservation society following mass strandings of moon jellyfish in north wales .
experts are also hoping it will lead to a better understanding of the endangered leatherback turtle , which feeds on jellyfish .
the society has produced free jellyfish identification guides .
it is encouraging seaside visitors and people who use the sea regularly to record any jellyfish they encounter .
species officer peter richardson said many sightings had already been received .
" we are urging anyone who is fishing , sailing or walking along beaches to record their jellyfish encounters and join in this effort to understand the ecology of our fabulous jellyfish , " he said .
reports so far suggest that the jellyfish are appearing in much the same way as 2004 , with millions of harmless moon jellyfish swarming along the west coasts of wales , scotland , and england .
in many areas , the moon jellyfish swarms are usually accompanied by the largest species in britain , the lion 's mane jellyfish , which has a powerful sting .
" while we welcome public participation in our survey , the mcs message is 'look , do n't touch ' , as some jellyfish , and especially the lion 's mane , can give you a very painful sting , " mr richardson said .
" large swarms of lion 's mane jellyfish have already appeared off western scotland , and in late june we received a report of a 1.5m wide , 5m-long specimen spotted off the isle of man . "
last year proved a particularly good one for jellyfish-spotters .
" it is not clear why large numbers of some species suddenly appear in uk waters , but we expect environmental factors such as weather patterns and sea temperatures to play a role , " mr richardson explained .
" the met office has already predicted that this summer 's temperatures may be above average , so it will be interesting to see how the jellyfish respond . "
mr richardson said nature-lovers in wales had proved extremely helpful , with the mass sightings at the end of june in wales fuelling curiosity .
" somebody reported a sighting of moon jellyfish last weekend on anglesey , " he said .
in june around 1,000 moon jellyfish came ashore at blackrock sands in morfa bychan , near porthmadog .
the moon jellyfish , which are transparent with purple rings and are umbrella-shaped , were brought to shore by warm sea currents .
anyone who wishes to help with the survey can download a guide and recording forms from the marine conservation society website , or call the office to request a hard copy .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- politics show -pipe- north west : urban renewal bbc news / politics show graphics version bbc sport home politics show -pipe- archive -pipe- contact us -pipe- faqs -pipe- interviews -pipe- meet the team -pipe- friday , 8 july , 2005 , 08:01 gmt 09:01 uk north west : urban renewal jim clarke politics show north west it is one of most distinctive urban landscapes in britain .
street after street of small red-brick terraced houses .
you see them right across the north west , in manchester , liverpool and the lancashire mill towns .
but while they might look great in a hovis advert or a lowry painting , they are less attractive in the windows of estate agents .
many are vacant , the prices have collapsed .
they are too small and there are too many of them .
the sense of decay and abandonment drags communities down .
so what is the answer ?
urban renewal ?
the government believes the way forward is large scale demolition .
inner city boost birmingham : £ 44m manchester : £ 42m liverpool : £ 40m newham : £ 26m hackney : £ 23m bradford : £ 19.6m sheffield : £ 19.1m nottingham : £ 18.5m doncaster : £ 17.8m leeds : £ 16.8m thousands of these homes are earmarked for the bulldozer in the biggest housing renewal project since the sixties .
john prescott has established " pathfinder " projects right across the north and the midlands .
in the north west they can be found in manchester , salford , merseyside , oldham and east lancashire .
communities opposed ?
the plan is to flatten large areas of unwanted houses and replace them with a smaller number of homes offering a more attractive mixture of flats and larger houses .
the idea is that the housing market revives , people move in to the area , the local economy picks up further investment follows behind .
sounds good , but the policy has become increasingly controversial .
many communities do n't want to see their area flattened by the wrecking ball .
small campaign groups have been set up to fight the plans .
establishment support they have been supported in some cases by groups like english heritage who are unhappy about the destruction of a distinctive urban landscape .
mps - mostly labour - have taken a bit of a hammering from angry constituents asking why homes can not be refurbished rather than bulldozed .
now there are signs that the government might be cooling on pathfinder programmes and may be considering scaling back the demolition plans .
the politics show has been taking a look at the pathfinder projects in east lancashire where 82,000 homes are to be demolished or refurbished .
in towns like burnley the average house price has dropped to £ 52,000 - less than half the national average .
something has to be done .
politics show but is demolition the answer ?
our reporter gill dummigan has spoken to the people whose homes could be flattened and to the people who are charged with the job of trying to give the town a new future .
also ...
jim hancock will be taking a look at the by-election battle in cheadle following the death of patsy calton .
in the 80s and 90s cheadle , with its acres of red brick semis and leafy suburban streets , used to be a safe tory seat .
that is until the 2001 election .
the fact that they could not win it back in may 2005 illustrated the depth of their problems .
so why does n't hyacinth bucket vote tory any more ?
we talk through that issue and other by election issues with the three main candidates .
so join jim hancock on sunday , 10 july 2005 at 12.30pm , for the politics show on bbc one .

street after street of small red-brick terraced houses .
you see them right across the north west , in manchester , liverpool and the lancashire mill towns .
but while they might look great in a hovis advert or a lowry painting , they are less attractive in the windows of estate agents .
many are vacant , the prices have collapsed .
they are too small and there are too many of them .
the sense of decay and abandonment drags communities down .
so what is the answer ?
urban renewal ?
the government believes the way forward is large scale demolition .
inner city boost birmingham : £ 44m manchester : £ 42m liverpool : £ 40m newham : £ 26m hackney : £ 23m bradford : £ 19.6m sheffield : £ 19.1m nottingham : £ 18.5m doncaster : £ 17.8m leeds : £ 16.8m thousands of these homes are earmarked for the bulldozer in the biggest housing renewal project since the sixties .
john prescott has established " pathfinder " projects right across the north and the midlands .
in the north west they can be found in manchester , salford , merseyside , oldham and east lancashire .
communities opposed ?
the plan is to flatten large areas of unwanted houses and replace them with a smaller number of homes offering a more attractive mixture of flats and larger houses .
the idea is that the housing market revives , people move in to the area , the local economy picks up further investment follows behind .
sounds good , but the policy has become increasingly controversial .
many communities do n't want to see their area flattened by the wrecking ball .
small campaign groups have been set up to fight the plans .
establishment support they have been supported in some cases by groups like english heritage who are unhappy about the destruction of a distinctive urban landscape .
mps - mostly labour - have taken a bit of a hammering from angry constituents asking why homes can not be refurbished rather than bulldozed .
now there are signs that the government might be cooling on pathfinder programmes and may be considering scaling back the demolition plans .
the politics show has been taking a look at the pathfinder projects in east lancashire where 82,000 homes are to be demolished or refurbished .
in towns like burnley the average house price has dropped to £ 52,000 - less than half the national average .
something has to be done .
politics show but is demolition the answer ?
our reporter gill dummigan has spoken to the people whose homes could be flattened and to the people who are charged with the job of trying to give the town a new future .
have the conservatives lost mrs bucket ?
also ...
jim hancock will be taking a look at the by-election battle in cheadle following the death of patsy calton .
in the 80s and 90s cheadle , with its acres of red brick semis and leafy suburban streets , used to be a safe tory seat .
that is until the 2001 election .
the fact that they could not win it back in may 2005 illustrated the depth of their problems .
so why does n't hyacinth bucket vote tory any more ?
we talk through that issue and other by election issues with the three main candidates .
so join jim hancock on sunday , 10 july 2005 at 12.30pm , for the politics show on bbc one .

"
it began , as these things so often do , with a phone call from an anxious parent .
my dad wanted to be reassured that i was okay , and was pleased to hear i was not in london where there were reports of a power surge on the tube that had caused accidents and injuries .
and so i turned to the web , where the story was played out in a mixture of news reports , blog postings , photographs and stories .
others have written about the importance of the blogosphere in providing testimony and eyewitness reports , of the fantastic effort going into keeping the wikipedia page up to date during the day and how flickr feeds and photoblogs provided a vastly widened eye for the public gaze .
text and e-mail but my concern was not the public sphere but the private one . "
it is a remarkable aspect of our networked society that we can reach out to those we know so easily and so effectively " net surge strains news sites mobiles snap blast aftermath i sent text messages and e-mails to some , tried calling others , finding it impossible to get through to any mobiles , and fielded a dozen or so queries from friends who know that my schedule often takes me to london early in the morning , via kings cross and onto the piccadilly line .
there was no bad news .
nobody called to tell me the worst ; no e-mails arrived with someone else 's name in the subject line .
and by the end of the day enough people were clearly okay and in a position to tell me if others had been affected for some sense of calm to return .
i checked the blogs of those i care for , relaxing if they had posted some comment , however trivial , about the events of the day .
thanks to the network , websites , e-mails , chat , mobile phones , instant messenger , i was able to reach out to my friends and colleagues , able to reassure myself , and able to feel confident that if something had happened to someone close to me then i would have heard .
immediacy of news this also means , i am sure , that those who lost loved ones , friends or colleagues found out more quickly than they would have done if this atrocity had happened five years ago .
this will do nothing to diminish their pain .
i think that i would rather have known at once instead of having to wait hours or even days to hear , but i can not be certain .
once information is moving faster , then it brings both good and bad news with equal speed .
it is a remarkable aspect of our networked society that we can reach out to those we know so easily and so effectively .
once this privilege would have been reserved for the powerful , the wealthy and the famous .
now it is available to all of us .
i am writing this in the bar of the cambridge arts picturehouse , waiting to go in to the uk premiere of the last mitterand , the opening film of this year 's film festival .
it feels good to be surrounded by people .
thanks to the open wireless network i can also look at the bbc news website and see that the number of dead has risen to 37 , and i grieve for every one of them .
but , more selfishly , i can reassure myself that no e-mails have arrived from friends and colleagues to tell me the bad news i do not want to hear .
and i will keep my phone switched on , silent , in the film tonight , just in case anyone calls or texts . "

text and e-mail but my concern was not the public sphere but the private one .
it is a remarkable aspect of our networked society that we can reach out to those we know so easily and so effectively net surge strains news sites mobiles snap blast aftermath i sent text messages and e-mails to some , tried calling others , finding it impossible to get through to any mobiles , and fielded a dozen or so queries from friends who know that my schedule often takes me to london early in the morning , via kings cross and onto the piccadilly line .
there was no bad news .
nobody called to tell me the worst ; no e-mails arrived with someone else 's name in the subject line .
and by the end of the day enough people were clearly okay and in a position to tell me if others had been affected for some sense of calm to return .
i checked the blogs of those i care for , relaxing if they had posted some comment , however trivial , about the events of the day .
thanks to the network , websites , e-mails , chat , mobile phones , instant messenger , i was able to reach out to my friends and colleagues , able to reassure myself , and able to feel confident that if something had happened to someone close to me then i would have heard .
immediacy of news this also means , i am sure , that those who lost loved ones , friends or colleagues found out more quickly than they would have done if this atrocity had happened five years ago .
this will do nothing to diminish their pain .
many were left in a state of shock i think that i would rather have known at once instead of having to wait hours or even days to hear , but i can not be certain .
once information is moving faster , then it brings both good and bad news with equal speed .
it is a remarkable aspect of our networked society that we can reach out to those we know so easily and so effectively .
once this privilege would have been reserved for the powerful , the wealthy and the famous .
now it is available to all of us .
i am writing this in the bar of the cambridge arts picturehouse , waiting to go in to the uk premiere of the last mitterand , the opening film of this year 's film festival .
it feels good to be surrounded by people .
thanks to the open wireless network i can also look at the bbc news website and see that the number of dead has risen to 37 , and i grieve for every one of them .
but , more selfishly , i can reassure myself that no e-mails have arrived from friends and colleagues to tell me the bad news i do not want to hear .
and i will keep my phone switched on , silent , in the film tonight , just in case anyone calls or texts .
