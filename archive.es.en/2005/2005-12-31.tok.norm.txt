" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon . " " russia will deliver energy supplies only to those it likes , only to those regimes who are friendly with russia , " andrei illarionov told echo moscow radio . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to review gas supplies amid russia-ukraine standoff the european commission on friday called a special meeting to review gas supplies amid concern about the knock-on effect if russia goes ahead with a threat to cut the flow to ukraine in a flaring dispute over gas prices .

these families have to survive on less than half of the average salary nationwide , which is the sociologists ' definition of relative poverty in the industrialized world . this , of course , has little to do with the united nations ’ definition of poverty , which defines people as poor , if they are forced to subsist on less than a dollar per day .
nevertheless , child poverty in germany is seen as an alarming signal because of the shortcomings it reflects in day-care and the education system . single parents likely to fall through gaps barbara stolterfoth , who heads a large german welfare organisation , says children in single-parent households are most likely to fall into the poverty trap . " single parents in germany do n't have a chance to have a place in a kindergarten or in a day-care center , so most of the time they can not go to work because they have to care for the children , " stolterfoth said . statistically , early-age poverty in germany has a tremendous impact on the educational opportunities enjoyed by a child later in life .
only four out of 100 children who are considered poor during kindergarten age actually make it to higher education . the likelihood of a decent education is even slimmer for poor children from migrant backgrounds . strong psychological pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government needs to invest more in kindergartens social scientists such as klaus hurrelmann hope that the grand coalition government in berlin will fully implement the long-term measures it promised to fight child poverty and reform the education system . he says poor children are often barred from numerous hobbies and leisure activities taken for granted by their more prosperous peers .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon . " " russia will deliver energy supplies only to those it likes , only to those regimes who are friendly with russia , " andrei illarionov told echo moscow radio . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to review gas supplies amid russia-ukraine standoff the european commission on friday called a special meeting to review gas supplies amid concern about the knock-on effect if russia goes ahead with a threat to cut the flow to ukraine in a flaring dispute over gas prices .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .

the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal .

polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon .

dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .

you have had enough of that , " she said , reiterating her aim to return germany to its status as one of europe 's most dynamic economies by 2010 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.12.2005 child poverty in affluent germany on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more children in germany are losing out welfare groups fear that the number of poor children will continue to rise as the correlation between poverty as a child and missing out on a proper education is stronger in germany than in many other places in the west . " there was a time when i ’ d look forward to christmas and new year , " a 14-year-old boy on the streets of berlin said recently .
" but now i ’ m really fed up with all these celebrations around me .
they should be done away with completely , " he added .
" that ’ s how i feel about it . ” he ’ s one of some 3,500 young berliners aged between 14 and 21 who live rough and unprotected lives out on the streets . the bright city lights of the festive season leave them cold , because they have no money to spend on consumer goods or services . warning words a new study recently presented by welfare organizations contains a message of warning that sociologists and lawmakers have been trying to get across for some time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german government says about 15 percent of all kids up to age 14 are poor child poverty in affluent germany is on the rise , and the number of children in poverty has already exceeded the one million mark . the situation is particularly drastic in larger cities where an estimated one in four children and their parents can hardly make both ends meet .
these families have to survive on less than half of the average salary nationwide , which is the sociologists ' definition of relative poverty in the industrialized world . this , of course , has little to do with the united nations ’ definition of poverty , which defines people as poor , if they are forced to subsist on less than a dollar per day .
nevertheless , child poverty in germany is seen as an alarming signal because of the shortcomings it reflects in day-care and the education system . single parents likely to fall through gaps barbara stolterfoth , who heads a large german welfare organisation , says children in single-parent households are most likely to fall into the poverty trap . " single parents in germany do n't have a chance to have a place in a kindergarten or in a day-care center , so most of the time they can not go to work because they have to care for the children , " stolterfoth said . statistically , early-age poverty in germany has a tremendous impact on the educational opportunities enjoyed by a child later in life .
only four out of 100 children who are considered poor during kindergarten age actually make it to higher education . the likelihood of a decent education is even slimmer for poor children from migrant backgrounds . strong psychological pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the government needs to invest more in kindergartens social scientists such as klaus hurrelmann hope that the grand coalition government in berlin will fully implement the long-term measures it promised to fight child poverty and reform the education system . he says poor children are often barred from numerous hobbies and leisure activities taken for granted by their more prosperous peers .
the poorer parent simply ca n't afford them .
this leads to what sociologists call the multiple deprivation symptom , which the poor have to learn to cope with . " the problems that children in rich germany have are not comparable to those in developing countries , for example in africa , " hurrelmann said . " however , the psychological pressure can not be overlooked , it is a very heavy burden to cope with your economic achievement and social situation .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .

will 2006 be the year that germany emerges from its shadow ? for at least five years - some would say 10 - germany 's manufacturers , its service and retail sector and its fortunes in general seemed to have been on the down . but the country faces 2006 with a new leader , and with perhaps a better shot at turning its fortunes around than at any time in the last decade .
all eyes will undoubtedly be on chancellor angela merkel , who 's heard mostly accolades for her much-publicized role as mediator at the contentious budget talks of the european union in mid-december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has good reason to be confident of what the future holds " i think people outside of germany are realizing more and more that she is a powerful woman , " said gerd langguth , author of a merkel biography .
" on the other hand , the political honeymoon will be over very soon , and she will be caught up by the daily routine . " political scientist ulrich von alemann of the university of düsseldorf agreed that angela merkel got off to a good start with her new colleagues in the european union , but said the really tough work will be at home in germany where the economy has shown signs of picking up steam , despite being weighed down by near record unemployment . sustaining the momentum but to keep the momentum going , he said , merkel must learn to govern with her former political opponents after her conservative christian democrats were forced into a grand coalition with the social democrats by german voters in the fall . " they had a bitter fight and they have to learn to cooperate now , " alemann said .
" and it sometimes seems there is only cooperation on the surface . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel consults with european commission president barroso ahead of the brussels summit on dec .
15 according to alemann , the grand coalition will likely be judged first on its ability to reduce unemployment , and then on the manner with which it deals with the red ink of germany 's budget deficit which is set to exceed the eu 's limits again in 2006 . as for germany 's role in europe , analysts such as annette heuser , the director of the brussels-based bertelsmann foundation , see chancellor merkel rearranging her country 's priorities in 2006 . strong position in the eu " the merkel approach to integrate britain and france and make sure paris is not the one and only partner of berlin will open new options for merkel when it comes to eu appeals , " heuser said .
" right now , she is seen as a power broker , an honest negotiator and political leader in europe and i think she will be taken more seriously by countries in central and eastern europe than gerhard schröder had been taken before . " pushing forward an eu constitution will be a central goal of the european union under austrian , then finnish leadership in 2006 .
in 2007 , germany takes over the rotating presidency for the first six months , and there is concern that member states may wait until the so-called engine of europe and merkel are at the controls , before they choose to take major strides forward . " this will be proof of her ability to be an important chancellor , " alemann said . before that time comes though , chancellor merkel 's decisions and persuasive abilities on the domestic front may very well determine whether germany really is back on the up . kyle mckinnon -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor publishes pep talk for the nation angela merkel wrote an open letter to germans , calling on them to join her in tackling the major challenges facing the country including unemployment and a low birthrate .

will 2006 be the year that germany emerges from its shadow ? for at least five years - some would say 10 - germany 's manufacturers , its service and retail sector and its fortunes in general seemed to have been on the down . but the country faces 2006 with a new leader , and with perhaps a better shot at turning its fortunes around than at any time in the last decade .
all eyes will undoubtedly be on chancellor angela merkel , who 's heard mostly accolades for her much-publicized role as mediator at the contentious budget talks of the european union in mid-december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has good reason to be confident of what the future holds " i think people outside of germany are realizing more and more that she is a powerful woman , " said gerd langguth , author of a merkel biography .
" on the other hand , the political honeymoon will be over very soon , and she will be caught up by the daily routine . " political scientist ulrich von alemann of the university of düsseldorf agreed that angela merkel got off to a good start with her new colleagues in the european union , but said the really tough work will be at home in germany where the economy has shown signs of picking up steam , despite being weighed down by near record unemployment . sustaining the momentum but to keep the momentum going , he said , merkel must learn to govern with her former political opponents after her conservative christian democrats were forced into a grand coalition with the social democrats by german voters in the fall . " they had a bitter fight and they have to learn to cooperate now , " alemann said .
" and it sometimes seems there is only cooperation on the surface . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel consults with european commission president barroso ahead of the brussels summit on dec .
15 according to alemann , the grand coalition will likely be judged first on its ability to reduce unemployment , and then on the manner with which it deals with the red ink of germany 's budget deficit which is set to exceed the eu 's limits again in 2006 . as for germany 's role in europe , analysts such as annette heuser , the director of the brussels-based bertelsmann foundation , see chancellor merkel rearranging her country 's priorities in 2006 . strong position in the eu " the merkel approach to integrate britain and france and make sure paris is not the one and only partner of berlin will open new options for merkel when it comes to eu appeals , " heuser said .
" right now , she is seen as a power broker , an honest negotiator and political leader in europe and i think she will be taken more seriously by countries in central and eastern europe than gerhard schröder had been taken before . " pushing forward an eu constitution will be a central goal of the european union under austrian , then finnish leadership in 2006 .
in 2007 , germany takes over the rotating presidency for the first six months , and there is concern that member states may wait until the so-called engine of europe and merkel are at the controls , before they choose to take major strides forward . " this will be proof of her ability to be an important chancellor , " alemann said . before that time comes though , chancellor merkel 's decisions and persuasive abilities on the domestic front may very well determine whether germany really is back on the up . kyle mckinnon -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor publishes pep talk for the nation angela merkel wrote an open letter to germans , calling on them to join her in tackling the major challenges facing the country including unemployment and a low birthrate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.12.2005 new year holds promise of upswing for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look closely , the tables are turning in germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .
will 2006 be the year that germany emerges from its shadow ? for at least five years - some would say 10 - germany 's manufacturers , its service and retail sector and its fortunes in general seemed to have been on the down . but the country faces 2006 with a new leader , and with perhaps a better shot at turning its fortunes around than at any time in the last decade .
all eyes will undoubtedly be on chancellor angela merkel , who 's heard mostly accolades for her much-publicized role as mediator at the contentious budget talks of the european union in mid-december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has good reason to be confident of what the future holds " i think people outside of germany are realizing more and more that she is a powerful woman , " said gerd langguth , author of a merkel biography .
" on the other hand , the political honeymoon will be over very soon , and she will be caught up by the daily routine . " political scientist ulrich von alemann of the university of düsseldorf agreed that angela merkel got off to a good start with her new colleagues in the european union , but said the really tough work will be at home in germany where the economy has shown signs of picking up steam , despite being weighed down by near record unemployment . sustaining the momentum but to keep the momentum going , he said , merkel must learn to govern with her former political opponents after her conservative christian democrats were forced into a grand coalition with the social democrats by german voters in the fall .

in 2007 , germany takes over the rotating presidency for the first six months , and there is concern that member states may wait until the so-called engine of europe and merkel are at the controls , before they choose to take major strides forward .

government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .

moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.12.2005 new year holds promise of upswing for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if you look closely , the tables are turning in germany the media is beginning to link signs of an economic recovery in germany to the dawn of a new era under the rule of chancellor merkel .
will 2006 be the year that germany emerges from its shadow ? for at least five years - some would say 10 - germany 's manufacturers , its service and retail sector and its fortunes in general seemed to have been on the down . but the country faces 2006 with a new leader , and with perhaps a better shot at turning its fortunes around than at any time in the last decade .
all eyes will undoubtedly be on chancellor angela merkel , who 's heard mostly accolades for her much-publicized role as mediator at the contentious budget talks of the european union in mid-december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has good reason to be confident of what the future holds " i think people outside of germany are realizing more and more that she is a powerful woman , " said gerd langguth , author of a merkel biography .
" on the other hand , the political honeymoon will be over very soon , and she will be caught up by the daily routine . " political scientist ulrich von alemann of the university of düsseldorf agreed that angela merkel got off to a good start with her new colleagues in the european union , but said the really tough work will be at home in germany where the economy has shown signs of picking up steam , despite being weighed down by near record unemployment . sustaining the momentum but to keep the momentum going , he said , merkel must learn to govern with her former political opponents after her conservative christian democrats were forced into a grand coalition with the social democrats by german voters in the fall . " they had a bitter fight and they have to learn to cooperate now , " alemann said .
" and it sometimes seems there is only cooperation on the surface . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel consults with european commission president barroso ahead of the brussels summit on dec .
15 according to alemann , the grand coalition will likely be judged first on its ability to reduce unemployment , and then on the manner with which it deals with the red ink of germany 's budget deficit which is set to exceed the eu 's limits again in 2006 . as for germany 's role in europe , analysts such as annette heuser , the director of the brussels-based bertelsmann foundation , see chancellor merkel rearranging her country 's priorities in 2006 . strong position in the eu " the merkel approach to integrate britain and france and make sure paris is not the one and only partner of berlin will open new options for merkel when it comes to eu appeals , " heuser said .
" right now , she is seen as a power broker , an honest negotiator and political leader in europe and i think she will be taken more seriously by countries in central and eastern europe than gerhard schröder had been taken before . " pushing forward an eu constitution will be a central goal of the european union under austrian , then finnish leadership in 2006 .
in 2007 , germany takes over the rotating presidency for the first six months , and there is concern that member states may wait until the so-called engine of europe and merkel are at the controls , before they choose to take major strides forward . " this will be proof of her ability to be an important chancellor , " alemann said . before that time comes though , chancellor merkel 's decisions and persuasive abilities on the domestic front may very well determine whether germany really is back on the up . kyle mckinnon -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor publishes pep talk for the nation angela merkel wrote an open letter to germans , calling on them to join her in tackling the major challenges facing the country including unemployment and a low birthrate .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon . " " russia will deliver energy supplies only to those it likes , only to those regimes who are friendly with russia , " andrei illarionov told echo moscow radio . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to review gas supplies amid russia-ukraine standoff the european commission on friday called a special meeting to review gas supplies amid concern about the knock-on effect if russia goes ahead with a threat to cut the flow to ukraine in a flaring dispute over gas prices .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 31.12.2005 putin offers compromise to break russia-ukraine gas deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has control of its neighbors ' natural gas supplies russian president vladimir putin offered saturday to delay a steep price rise in natural gas for ukraine in an 11th-hour bid to resolve a bitter row before moscow cuts gas supplies to the ex-soviet republic . putin said ukraine could receive russian gas at existing lower prices until april and then switch to the four-fold increase being demanded by state-controlled gas giant gazprom . " i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon . " " russia will deliver energy supplies only to those it likes , only to those regimes who are friendly with russia , " andrei illarionov told echo moscow radio . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu to review gas supplies amid russia-ukraine standoff the european commission on friday called a special meeting to review gas supplies amid concern about the knock-on effect if russia goes ahead with a threat to cut the flow to ukraine in a flaring dispute over gas prices .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .

the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .

" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .

in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon .

" i instruct the government and gazprom to ensure gas deliveries in the first quarter of 2006 with the conditions and rates of 2005 , on the condition that before the end of today the ukrainian partners sign the contract with gazprom 's offer for switching to market prices in the second quarter , " putin said . there was no immediate reaction from kiev to putin 's televised remarks to his security council and the head of gazprom , but officials said they expected a statement from president viktor yushchenko .
government sources in kiev , who asked not to be identified , said they were cautiously optimistic .
" it 's very good , " said a source close to the energy ministry . putin 's dramatic offer came less than 24 hours before gazprom had been due to cut supplies to ukraine unless it agreed immediately to the price rises .
dependence on russian gas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin said he 'd give ukraine a small break the row has sparked concern in western europe , which is heavily dependent on russian energy supplies , and cast a shadow over the start to russia 's 2006 presidency of the group of eight -lrb- g8 -rrb- industrialized nations ' club , during which moscow wants to present itself as a reliable energy provider . gazprom wants ukraine to pay $ 230 -lrb- 195 euros -rrb- per 1,000 cubic meters -lrb- 35,335 cubic feet -rrb- of gas from the start of 2006 , up from the current $ 50 .
the company says this price reflects standard world rates . ukraine says it is ready to pay more but not so quickly and is offering up to $ 80 in a preliminary transition period .
moscow has flatly dismissed the offer . gazprom , which controls a third of the world 's gas reserves , says it is ready to end supplies to the country of 48 million people at 10:00 am moscow time -lrb- 0700 gmt -rrb- on sunday if kiev still refuses the deal . " all we need is the command " to cut supplies , alexander glazkritsky , the head of the mostransgaz control center near the russian-ukrainian border , said on state-owned ort television .
ordinary folk unaffected ?
officials in kiev say industrial centers will see a drop in supplies , but ordinary people should notice no difference , as the country has enough gas reserves to last the bitterly cold winter .
" the people will feel nothing , " prime minister yuriy yekhanurov promised , although many ordinary ukrainians have expressed alarm . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kiev says ordinary consumers wo n't notice if moscow turns off the gas " if they close the gas taps that will be a disaster , " said 74-year-old former nurse olena rakivska , who lives in a village in the jitomir region of northern ukraine .
" how could they ?
it 's not possible .
it 's inhuman . " there has been mounting concern in western europe , with the european commission calling a special meeting of its gas coordination group for wednesday to discuss the issue .
polish economy minister piotr wozniak said his country , which receives 90 percent of its imported gas from the east , would feel " the harmful potential effects " within days .
political overtones although gazprom insists the dispute is purely commercial , it has had unmistakable political overtones . yushchenko came to power almost exactly a year ago in the pro-western " orange revolution " that saw him defeat a russian-backed candidate in elections and vow to bring his country into the european union and nato .
in march , his supporters face a strong challenge in parliamentary elections that could signal the comeback of his pro-kremlin rival viktor yanukovich . putin 's longtime economic adviser , who resigned this week to protest what he said was the lack of freedom in russia , has accused moscow of using energy as a " weapon .

will 2006 be the year that germany emerges from its shadow ? for at least five years - some would say 10 - germany 's manufacturers , its service and retail sector and its fortunes in general seemed to have been on the down . but the country faces 2006 with a new leader , and with perhaps a better shot at turning its fortunes around than at any time in the last decade .
all eyes will undoubtedly be on chancellor angela merkel , who 's heard mostly accolades for her much-publicized role as mediator at the contentious budget talks of the european union in mid-december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has good reason to be confident of what the future holds " i think people outside of germany are realizing more and more that she is a powerful woman , " said gerd langguth , author of a merkel biography .
" on the other hand , the political honeymoon will be over very soon , and she will be caught up by the daily routine . " political scientist ulrich von alemann of the university of düsseldorf agreed that angela merkel got off to a good start with her new colleagues in the european union , but said the really tough work will be at home in germany where the economy has shown signs of picking up steam , despite being weighed down by near record unemployment . sustaining the momentum but to keep the momentum going , he said , merkel must learn to govern with her former political opponents after her conservative christian democrats were forced into a grand coalition with the social democrats by german voters in the fall . " they had a bitter fight and they have to learn to cooperate now , " alemann said .
" and it sometimes seems there is only cooperation on the surface . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel consults with european commission president barroso ahead of the brussels summit on dec .
15 according to alemann , the grand coalition will likely be judged first on its ability to reduce unemployment , and then on the manner with which it deals with the red ink of germany 's budget deficit which is set to exceed the eu 's limits again in 2006 . as for germany 's role in europe , analysts such as annette heuser , the director of the brussels-based bertelsmann foundation , see chancellor merkel rearranging her country 's priorities in 2006 . strong position in the eu " the merkel approach to integrate britain and france and make sure paris is not the one and only partner of berlin will open new options for merkel when it comes to eu appeals , " heuser said .
" right now , she is seen as a power broker , an honest negotiator and political leader in europe and i think she will be taken more seriously by countries in central and eastern europe than gerhard schröder had been taken before . " pushing forward an eu constitution will be a central goal of the european union under austrian , then finnish leadership in 2006 .
in 2007 , germany takes over the rotating presidency for the first six months , and there is concern that member states may wait until the so-called engine of europe and merkel are at the controls , before they choose to take major strides forward . " this will be proof of her ability to be an important chancellor , " alemann said . before that time comes though , chancellor merkel 's decisions and persuasive abilities on the domestic front may very well determine whether germany really is back on the up . kyle mckinnon -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor publishes pep talk for the nation angela merkel wrote an open letter to germans , calling on them to join her in tackling the major challenges facing the country including unemployment and a low birthrate .

writing in the guardian , the lord chancellor lord falconer said the new laws had successfully cracked open " the culture of secrecy in whitehall " .
but a minority of requests had been made simply to feed the " wilder fevers of journalistic wish-lists " , he said .
lord falconer told the bbc the scope of the act could be widened to include private bodies running public services . "
i am not surprised that they have been some problems in relation to timing because this is a new arrangement " lord falconer the freedom of information act 2000 , which became law on 1 january 2005 , means people have the right to access information held by 100,000 public bodies .
police forces , hospitals , schools , local councils and the government are obliged to reply to requests for information .
but privately run public services are not covered by the laws .
lord falconer said he could see a case for widening the provisions of the act to include such bodies .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " they have not been included in the first wave , but there 's a provision in the act which allows the act 's provisions to be extended to bodies like privately run prisons or city academies . "
he suggested a consultation on which bodies they should be extended to should be undertaken .
' significant information ' on so-called frivolous inquiries , lord falconer said requests for the number of windows at the department for education and skills and for how much another department spent on toilet paper had been made .
irresponsible queries such as these diverted energy from answering " worthwhile requests " , he told the guardian .
" freedom of information is about giving power to the people , not about declaring open season for the wilder fevers of journalistic wish-lists , " he said .
but lord falconer said the vast majority of requests had been for key information about issues , especially local ones , which had " a real impact on people 's lives " .
" inevitably , a small minority have not been so responsible , " he told the paper .
" so we are looking now at the operation of the act to ensure that its central purpose is being honoured . "
' deluge of detail ' on today lord falconer said : " very , very significant amounts of information are being released . "
he added that something like 16,000 pieces of information had been disclosed by central government and other bodies in the nine months since the act came into force .
the act had led to " a deluge of detail coming into the public domain for the first time ever " , he said .
he added : " our job now is to sustain it for the benefit of all the people . "
lord falconer also defended the fact that at least one in 10 information request under the new laws had not been met in time , saying the vast majority had met the deadline .
he said : " of course there will be some not dealt with in the time because they take longer than expected .
" i am not surprised that there have been some problems in relation to timing because this is a new arrangement - it has changed completely the approach to disclosure that existed before . "

writing in the guardian , the lord chancellor lord falconer said the new laws had successfully cracked open " the culture of secrecy in whitehall " .
but a minority of requests had been made simply to feed the " wilder fevers of journalistic wish-lists " , he said .
lord falconer told the bbc the scope of the act could be widened to include private bodies running public services .
i am not surprised that they have been some problems in relation to timing because this is a new arrangement lord falconer the freedom of information act 2000 , which became law on 1 january 2005 , means people have the right to access information held by 100,000 public bodies .
police forces , hospitals , schools , local councils and the government are obliged to reply to requests for information .
but privately run public services are not covered by the laws .
lord falconer said he could see a case for widening the provisions of the act to include such bodies .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " they have not been included in the first wave , but there 's a provision in the act which allows the act 's provisions to be extended to bodies like privately run prisons or city academies . "
he suggested a consultation on which bodies they should be extended to should be undertaken .
' significant information ' on so-called frivolous inquiries , lord falconer said requests for the number of windows at the department for education and skills and for how much another department spent on toilet paper had been made .
irresponsible queries such as these diverted energy from answering " worthwhile requests " , he told the guardian .
" freedom of information is about giving power to the people , not about declaring open season for the wilder fevers of journalistic wish-lists , " he said .
but lord falconer said the vast majority of requests had been for key information about issues , especially local ones , which had " a real impact on people 's lives " .
" inevitably , a small minority have not been so responsible , " he told the paper .
" so we are looking now at the operation of the act to ensure that its central purpose is being honoured . "
' deluge of detail ' on today lord falconer said : " very , very significant amounts of information are being released . "
he added that something like 16,000 pieces of information had been disclosed by central government and other bodies in the nine months since the act came into force .
the act had led to " a deluge of detail coming into the public domain for the first time ever " , he said .
he added : " our job now is to sustain it for the benefit of all the people . "
lord falconer also defended the fact that at least one in 10 information request under the new laws had not been met in time , saying the vast majority had met the deadline .
he said : " of course there will be some not dealt with in the time because they take longer than expected .
" i am not surprised that there have been some problems in relation to timing because this is a new arrangement - it has changed completely the approach to disclosure that existed before . "

the sound of 2006 countdown will begin on monday .
one artist from this year 's top five will be revealed every day until friday , when the winner and full top 10 will be announced .
1 .
the bravery electro-rockers the bravery produced a well-received debut album , which was a top five hit in the uk and spawned a top 10 single , an honest mistake .
they also gained an enthusiastic live following thanks to a constant tour schedule and a string of festivals .
but the public at large was reluctant to board the bandwagon and the new york band failed to stick at the right end of the charts .
singer sam endicott also hit the headlines for a spat with the killers .
2 .
bloc party the cerebral guitar pounders were big favourites with indie hardliners .
silent alarm was named the best album of 2005 by the nme and was nominated for the mercury music prize .
they also scored two top 10 singles , with two more reaching the top 20 .
3 .
kano rapper kano rose to the top of the british hip-hop scene , but failed to make a mainstream breakthrough .
he received the title of best uk newcomer at the mobo awards .
4 .
the game helped by his mentor 50 cent , us rapper the game had a huge album and a string of hit singles - even if subsequent publicity surrounded the pair 's feud and alleged links to shootings .
5 .
kaiser chiefs this leeds indie-pop bunch were one of the bands of the year .
their infectious odes to english life captured the public 's imagination and their showmanship wowed live crowds .
they were the only uk band to appear at the us leg of live 8 , scored three uk top 10 hits and got a mercury nomination .
6 .
kt tunstall another success story , singer-songwriter kt tunstall achieved widespread popularity without abandoning her acoustic folk roots .
her album eye to the telescope sold a million in the uk and her song black horse and the cherry tree won the best track prize at the q awards .
7 .
the dead 60s scouse ska revivalists the dead 60s got a warm if not wild reception , registering three singles in the lower reaches of the uk top 30 during the last 12 months .
8 .
the dears canadian stalwarts the dears generated considerable excitement with their melodramatic indie anthem lost in the plot a year ago .
but despite that promise , they faded from view as their countrymen the arcade fire went on to take more plaudits .
9 .
tom vek still buzzing along nicely , this offbeat electro-pop songwriter won many fans if not a mainstream audience .
he is still an underground hero and has started to create ripples in the us .
10 .
the magic numbers heartwarming , harmonic melodies and sunny personalities made them one of the uk 's best-loved breakthrough bands .
their mercury-nominated album was perfect summer soundtrack material - even if they got more column inches for storming off top of the pops .
the ones that got away james blunt had the uk 's best-selling album of 2005 and opened the door for fellow songsmiths daniel powter and jack johnson .
the arctic monkeys and pussycat dolls also made major breakthroughs in the last 12 months but were not on the sound of 2005 radar .
previous polls keane won the sound of 2004 poll before going on to become one of that year 's biggest bands .
the top 10 also featured future stars franz ferdinand , razorlight , joss stone , mcfly and the scissor sisters .
the inaugural survey , sound of 2003 , was topped by us rapper 50 cent before he hit the big time .
dizzee rascal , audio bullys , mario and sean paul were among the others on the list .

kate burton , 24 , told the bbc they were treated well by their kidnappers during the two-and-a-half days they were held , but that her parents were " tired " .
their captors , a previously unheard of group called the mujahadeen brigades , released a video denouncing the uk and threatening to take more hostages .
the family , of newbury , berkshire , are in jerusalem with uk consular staff . "
we thank everyone who has worked so tirelessly towards this moment " burton family ms burton told bbc correspondent alan johnston the family had been moved three times in two days by their captors , who remained masked throughout .
she spoke of her sadness that her parents had had such a " desperate experience " during their visit to gaza , but said she hoped to continue her human rights work there .
ms burton , who works for the palestinian al mezan centre for human rights , also told the bbc arabic service she and her parents had been held in rafah , southern gaza .
she added that she could not say a bad word about her captors , who always asked whether they needed anything .
' overjoyed ' the uk foreign office , who had a team of diplomats in gaza , said it was pleased to confirm kate , hugh and win -lrb- helen -rrb- burton had been freed and were " well and in good spirits " .
" they are currently with officials in our consulate general in jerusalem who are providing them with all necessary help and care . "
officials thanked those who had helped secure the family 's release .
the burtons ' wider family in the uk said they were " overjoyed " to hear they were safe .
" we thank everyone who has worked so tirelessly towards this moment , especially kate 's colleagues and friends in gaza who kept all our hopes up throughout this ordeal .
" we do not forget the wider situation in gaza , but right now we are looking forward to being together as a family very soon , " they said .
the muslim association of britain , which was planning to send an emissary to gaza to seek the family 's release , said : " we are very relieved and joyful . "
they said they hoped the same steps could be followed in iraq , where briton norman kember and his colleagues are still being held .
there has been no news of the 74 year old since earlier this month .
the video apparently made by the burtons ' kidnappers and delivered to a tv company in gaza on friday evening , showed a masked gunman reading a statement while standing next to ms burton .
' despicable ' bbc correspondent jo floto said the statement , roughly translated , said the british government bore responsibility for what had happened to the palestinians since 1918 .
the previously unknown group made a list of demands and urged britain to put pressure on israel .
they said if their demands were not met they would capture international observers in the forthcoming elections .
they said they had freed the three britons in what they described as a gesture of good faith .
earlier chief palestinian negotiator saeb erekat told bbc news 24 he hoped this would be the last such incident , as kidnapping harmed the palestinians ' interests .
" i am happy this despicable and shameful act is over , " he said .
ms burton 's friend and work colleague ghada snunu said her role as international co-ordinator at the human rights centre was very important .
" she is responsible for contacting donors , writing reports to them , fundraising , proposal-writing and editing english documents .
" losing her is losing something really very , very essential , " she told the bbc .
terry waite , who was held hostage in beirut for five years , told the bbc it would be a " very sad day indeed " if the kidnapping meant people like kate no longer worked in the palestinian territories .
' needed ' jocelyn hurndall , the mother of student photographer tom hurndall who was shot dead by an israeli soldier , also said the kidnappers had done a great " disservice to their cause " .
she added : " kate is exactly the kind of person who is needed in a place like gaza . "
ms burton , who speaks arabic , french and spanish , is understood to have been showing her parents around rafah , near the border with egypt , when they were kidnapped .
uk muslim groups and the palestinian authority had condemned the kidnaps , and palestinians had demonstrated to vent their anger at the abductions .
