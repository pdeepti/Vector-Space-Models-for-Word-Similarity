instead , klinsmann looked for more experienced players and called dietmar hamann , 31 , and christian wörns , 34 , back to the national team .
but after the team 's unconvincing play in the netherlands earlier this month , it seems klinsmann is returning to his promise to introduce new players to the lineup and revitalize germany soccer .
nine players get first cap under klinsmann klinsmann called two new faces into his squad for the upcoming friendly matches against slovakia and south africa with marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz promoted from the under-21 team .

so far klinsmann has capped nine new players since taking charge after the euro 2004 finals and continues to put the emphasis on youth .
but klinsmann is quick to contest that leaving older players like hamann off the side should not be counted as strikes against them .
" we know what didi can do , the criticism after the dutch draw had no influence " klinsmann contested .
" last season he was a late starter and went on to win the champions league . "

up front , podolski will be joined by experienced strikers gerald asamoah , miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi .
klinsmann has also decided to stick to his policy of rotating goalkeepers before germany hosts the world cup next year , and left bayern munich 's oliver kahn off the roster , bringing back jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- back for the friendly trials in bratislava on sept .

instead , klinsmann looked for more experienced players and called dietmar hamann , 31 , and christian wörns , 34 , back to the national team .
but after the team 's unconvincing play in the netherlands earlier this month , it seems klinsmann is returning to his promise to introduce new players to the lineup and revitalize germany soccer .
nine players get first cap under klinsmann klinsmann called two new faces into his squad for the upcoming friendly matches against slovakia and south africa with marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz promoted from the under-21 team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcell jansen can celebrate being called up to the national team a defender at borussia mönchengladbach , 19-year-old jansen has made only 20 appearances in the bundesliga while cologne midfielder sinkiewicz , also 19 , has played just six times in the german top-flight .
so far klinsmann has capped nine new players since taking charge after the euro 2004 finals and continues to put the emphasis on youth .
but klinsmann is quick to contest that leaving older players like hamann off the side should not be counted as strikes against them .
" we know what didi can do , the criticism after the dutch draw had no influence " klinsmann contested .
" last season he was a late starter and went on to win the champions league . "

captain michael ballack and bernd schneider will give stability to the midfield while christian wörns , who unlike hamann is still on the current national team roster , usually holds down the defensive end .
up front , podolski will be joined by experienced strikers gerald asamoah , miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi .
klinsmann has also decided to stick to his policy of rotating goalkeepers before germany hosts the world cup next year , and left bayern munich 's oliver kahn off the roster , bringing back jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- back for the friendly trials in bratislava on sept .
3 and in bremen against south africa four days later .
bildunterschrift : kahn not going anywhere while most nations have an established number one custodian , germany rotate kahn and arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann as klinsmann believes it is good for competition ahead of the world cup .
kahn lost his undisputed mantle as the number one keeper after klinsmann was named german national coach in august 2004 and ever since then some have expected him to step away from the international competition - a move he calls " absurd . "

eu member states will draw up individual lists and the european commission will combine them .

a recent survey highlighted the alarming rise in child poverty in germany .
advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .
ulrich schneider , managing director of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband association of charities , said the reforms known as harz iv have led to a drastic cut in benefits for the long-term unemployed , which in turn has had a severe financial impact on thousands of children across germany .
east hit hardest the subsistence-level benefits being paid out to the needy now are too little for too many , schneider argued .
poverty among children under age 15 has risen 14.2 percent since the end of 2004 , to over 1.5 million affected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the eastern part of the country is particularly alarming , schneider said .
every third child there is poor .
the most affected areas are berlin , schwerin , goerlitz and halle .
schneider called for special payments to be granted to poor families to finance school supplies .
" it ’ s yet unclear what it means for our society if in the eastern areas , every third child lives on benefits that are far too low to enable them to take an active part in social life , " he said .
" these kids will never enjoy music courses or computer training , go to a sports club , visit a zoo and the like .
this situation is appalling . "
seeking a fix schneider also said it is vital to ensure that kids from poorer backgrounds are given equal opportunities in the educational system .
recent studies show that nowhere else in western society does a child ’ s social background have such an impact on his educational opportunities .
on thursday , german social democrat family minister renate schmidt presented a report on the situation of families in germany , compiled by an independent advisory panel .
the report highlighted the current shortcomings in the state ’ s help for parents and single mothers .
" i particularly support the part of the study that emphasizes the necessity for more financial assistance to parents in the first year after a child is born , " schmidt said .
" our election manifesto includes proposals to this effect .
we want to make sure that parents get more support for raising their kids at home - without incurring painful financial losses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.08.2005 leap in child poverty worries advocates großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more and more german kids live under the poverty line .
a recent survey highlighted the alarming rise in child poverty in germany .
advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .
ulrich schneider , managing director of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband association of charities , said the reforms known as harz iv have led to a drastic cut in benefits for the long-term unemployed , which in turn has had a severe financial impact on thousands of children across germany .
east hit hardest the subsistence-level benefits being paid out to the needy now are too little for too many , schneider argued .
poverty among children under age 15 has risen 14.2 percent since the end of 2004 , to over 1.5 million affected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the eastern part of the country is particularly alarming , schneider said .
every third child there is poor .
the most affected areas are berlin , schwerin , goerlitz and halle .
schneider called for special payments to be granted to poor families to finance school supplies .
" it ’ s yet unclear what it means for our society if in the eastern areas , every third child lives on benefits that are far too low to enable them to take an active part in social life , " he said .
" these kids will never enjoy music courses or computer training , go to a sports club , visit a zoo and the like .

now fans in the city on the rhine are wondering how long it can last . that bayern munich would lead the bundesliga as the season begins was clear .
that only two points would separate schalke 04 and werder bremen from the bavarians also does n't take much imagination .
but at the beginning of the month if you said cologne would be tied on points for third place you 'd have been laughed out of the stadium .
" it 's no accident that we started the season so well , " fc köln coach uwe rapolder told german public broadcaster ard .
" there was a clear , tactical process that went from my mind to the players ' . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mascot hennes gets hydrated before motivating his team but rapolder 's esoteric process also benefited from a little luck in the opening 1-0 win against mainz and the gift of a missed penalty shot goal by vfb stuttgart assured cologne a 3-2 away victory .
the real disappointment would come in the bundesliga 's third week with a 3-2 loss , this time to on an extra-time penalty kick to kaiserslautern .
mounting expectations while the players were busy staging a comeback and scoring two goals , excited cologne fans began what will no doubt be endless chants meant to push their team forward into european competition .
" as far as expectations are concerned , maybe it was n't such a bad thing to have finished three to two , " rapolder said .
despite the loss to stuttgart , rapolder 's players are piquing the interest of german national team coach jürgen klinsmann .
lukas sinkiewicz will join teammate lukas podolski on the national team for the first time when they play international friendly matches against slovakia and south africa in the early september .
bildunterschrift : growing aspirations after being fired from lr ahlen three years ago and not finding a position for over a year , rapolder knows there are bigger problems that watching his top players tire themselves out for the national team .
equipped with a new stadium , internationally respected players and a good relationship with club management the question is whether cologne will stay in front of the bundesliga 's other top teams .
exactly how much rapolder intends to achieve may change as the season progresses .
originally , his goal was not to be sent back down to the second division , but if his streak of good luck continues cologne may pull off much more .
" we 're enjoying every week we spend near the top , " rapold said .
" but we can only achieve something if we 're ready to run a lot and play for each other . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : may never fit in with locals regardless of the success rapolder brings to the city , he may never fit in with his fans who are known for consuming substantial amounts of the local kölsch-style beer before , during and especially after games .

eu member states will draw up individual lists and the european commission will combine them .
" we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said at a briefing . the idea is to prevent an airline that has been banned in one state on safety concerns from doing business in another . france and belgium have taken the lead in the 25-nation eu , announcing plans to name-and-shame carriers from monday that do not respect safety regulations . bildunterschrift : on thursday , french transport minister dominique perben said that , from monday , a list of both banned and authorized companies would appear on the french civil aviation authority 's web site " in a way that is totally transparent . " the belgian transport ministry followed suit and said it too would publish a list on monday . " we do n't want to wait for the future european blacklist , " a spokeswoman for belgian transport minister renaat landuyt said . previously , only britain , switzerland and the united states prepared lists either of suspect companies or of countries in which civil aviation regulations were deemed inadequate . also taking the cue from france , switzerland said thursday that it would publish its list . differing strategies but not all member states want to take such an approach to airline safety .
italy , for example , prefers to draw up a list naming companies deemed to be safe . " in our country , if a company does not meet safety norms , it does not fly .
that 's why there 's no need for a blacklist , that is , a list of companies that are n't viable , " transport minister pietro lunardi said in newspaper interviews printed friday in la stampa and la repubblica . however , an eu official pointed out that there would be a " heavy responsibility " to assume if an airplane from a carrier on the italian list crashed . " the blacklist does not say that with other companies an accident ca n't happen but that with those on the list , you are taking a risk , " the official said . common criteria although the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list . bildunterschrift : undated picture of the airplane of the colombian airline west caribbean airways that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela on aug .
16 , 2005 . " we have to set common criteria at the european level , " lamented an official at the commission .
so far belgium , france , germany and spain have spearheaded the move to bring in an eu-wide list of suspect carriers . the european commission hopes that the backing from the european parliament will focus minds on compiling such a list .
one idea under consideration would consolidate lists in each member state and apply the result across the bloc . in the long run , the commission would like to be able to impose bans eu-wide , even though member states denied the eu executive such authority in early 2004 . in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a flash airlines ' boeing airliner , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a reinforcement of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

it was bayern 's 500th home win in the bundesliga and set off rumors that just three weeks into the bundesliga season the championship had already been decided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehmet scholl celebrates his goal in bayern 's 3-0 win michael ballack gave munich the lead early in the second half on a free kick , and late goals from mehmet scholl and roy makaay sealed bayern 's spot on top of the bundesliga table .
" the result camouflages how the game panned out , " explained bayern manager felix magath .
" hertha were very defensive due to their injury problems and we had very few chances . "
others ca n't match bayern none of the other teams tied for first going into the weekend 's games could match the bayern result .
cologne , knocked out of the german cup last weekend , gave up their first loss 3-2 at home to kaiserslautern , and 1-1 ties were handed out in the three matches between schalke 04 and borussia mönchengladbach ; hamburg sv and hanover 96 ; and werder bremen and vfb stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's ebbe sand , right , holds off mönchengladbach 's jeff strasser last season 's runners-up , schalke suffered through the disappointing draw at home .
for the third game in a row schalke fell behind with kasper bogelund netting on 41 minutes , but ebbe sand equalized after 54 minutes , giving the royal blues a share of the points .
stuttgart ties bremen under pressure stuttgart , and especially new coach giovanni trapattoni , were under pressure to post their first win after earning just one point in two games and the fans beginning to circle like sharks around the embattled coach and the draw away in bremen did n't help the one-time italy trainer , who is still waiting for his first bundesliga win .
danish international forward jon-dahl tomasson scored his first goal since his eight million euro -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- move from ac milan , slotting home in the 50th minute to cancel out ivan klasnic 's 40th minute opener .
" the first half was even but in the second werder were far better , " trapattoni admitted .
" but we had timo hildebrand in goal . "
bremen were left ruing the dropped points as they fell two points behind bayern in the table , although they retain second spot .
" we have to be happy with the point , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were good going forward but at the back we had a few nervy moments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's david jarolim , right , and hanover 's hanno balitsch fight for the ball hamburg could n't pull out a win but turned around a home losing streak against hanover with a 1-1 draw .
hanover started scoring in the 18th minute on a goal from jiri stajner .
three minutes later hamburg 's mehdi mahadivikia ended the celebrations and closed out scoring for both sides , giving hanover their third tie in as many games .
cologne falls in extra time kaiserlautern 's halil altintop , who is tied with munich 's roy makaay at the top of the scorer table , put an end to cologne 's victory march with a pair of goals .
after trailing by two going into the locker room , cologne 's matthias scherz and lukas podolski tied the game with goals in the 81st and 90th minute , only to see ervin skela cancel their work by converting a penalty in injury time and taking all three points back to kaiserslautern .
eintracht frankfurt , who joined cologne in being promoted to the german top flight this season , celebrated their first win , beating nuremberg 1-0 at home on a shot from captain jermaine jones in the 68th minute .
without a win - or even a goal - in three weeks , nuremberg seem to be making a comfortable spot for themselves in the bundesliga basement .
bildunterschrift : vfl wolfsburg got their first win and handed bayer leverkusen their second loss of the season in a slow moving 2-1 game .
demitar berbatov gave leverkusen the lead in the 22nd minute , but andres d 'alessandro and pablo thiam put in a header each to turn the score line around .
the game 's last minutes saw only nine leverkusen players leave the field as the referee sent off roque junior and marco babic with a justified red card each .

a recent survey highlighted the alarming rise in child poverty in germany .
advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .
ulrich schneider , managing director of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband association of charities , said the reforms known as harz iv have led to a drastic cut in benefits for the long-term unemployed , which in turn has had a severe financial impact on thousands of children across germany .
east hit hardest the subsistence-level benefits being paid out to the needy now are too little for too many , schneider argued .
poverty among children under age 15 has risen 14.2 percent since the end of 2004 , to over 1.5 million affected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the eastern part of the country is particularly alarming , schneider said .
every third child there is poor .
the most affected areas are berlin , schwerin , goerlitz and halle .
schneider called for special payments to be granted to poor families to finance school supplies .
" it ’ s yet unclear what it means for our society if in the eastern areas , every third child lives on benefits that are far too low to enable them to take an active part in social life , " he said .
" these kids will never enjoy music courses or computer training , go to a sports club , visit a zoo and the like .
this situation is appalling . "
seeking a fix schneider also said it is vital to ensure that kids from poorer backgrounds are given equal opportunities in the educational system .
recent studies show that nowhere else in western society does a child ’ s social background have such an impact on his educational opportunities .
on thursday , german social democrat family minister renate schmidt presented a report on the situation of families in germany , compiled by an independent advisory panel .
the report highlighted the current shortcomings in the state ’ s help for parents and single mothers .
" i particularly support the part of the study that emphasizes the necessity for more financial assistance to parents in the first year after a child is born , " schmidt said .
" our election manifesto includes proposals to this effect .
we want to make sure that parents get more support for raising their kids at home - without incurring painful financial losses .

a recent survey highlighted the alarming rise in child poverty in germany .
advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .
ulrich schneider , managing director of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband association of charities , said the reforms known as harz iv have led to a drastic cut in benefits for the long-term unemployed , which in turn has had a severe financial impact on thousands of children across germany .
east hit hardest the subsistence-level benefits being paid out to the needy now are too little for too many , schneider argued .
poverty among children under age 15 has risen 14.2 percent since the end of 2004 , to over 1.5 million affected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the eastern part of the country is particularly alarming , schneider said .
every third child there is poor .
the most affected areas are berlin , schwerin , goerlitz and halle .
schneider called for special payments to be granted to poor families to finance school supplies .
" it ’ s yet unclear what it means for our society if in the eastern areas , every third child lives on benefits that are far too low to enable them to take an active part in social life , " he said .
" these kids will never enjoy music courses or computer training , go to a sports club , visit a zoo and the like .
this situation is appalling . "
seeking a fix schneider also said it is vital to ensure that kids from poorer backgrounds are given equal opportunities in the educational system .
recent studies show that nowhere else in western society does a child ’ s social background have such an impact on his educational opportunities .
on thursday , german social democrat family minister renate schmidt presented a report on the situation of families in germany , compiled by an independent advisory panel .
the report highlighted the current shortcomings in the state ’ s help for parents and single mothers .
" i particularly support the part of the study that emphasizes the necessity for more financial assistance to parents in the first year after a child is born , " schmidt said .
" our election manifesto includes proposals to this effect .
we want to make sure that parents get more support for raising their kids at home - without incurring painful financial losses .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon .
-lrb- may 1 , 2005 -rrb- child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened .

a recent survey highlighted the alarming rise in child poverty in germany .
advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .
ulrich schneider , managing director of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband association of charities , said the reforms known as harz iv have led to a drastic cut in benefits for the long-term unemployed , which in turn has had a severe financial impact on thousands of children across germany .
east hit hardest the subsistence-level benefits being paid out to the needy now are too little for too many , schneider argued .
poverty among children under age 15 has risen 14.2 percent since the end of 2004 , to over 1.5 million affected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the eastern part of the country is particularly alarming , schneider said .
every third child there is poor .
the most affected areas are berlin , schwerin , goerlitz and halle .
schneider called for special payments to be granted to poor families to finance school supplies .
" it ’ s yet unclear what it means for our society if in the eastern areas , every third child lives on benefits that are far too low to enable them to take an active part in social life , " he said .
" these kids will never enjoy music courses or computer training , go to a sports club , visit a zoo and the like .
this situation is appalling . "
seeking a fix schneider also said it is vital to ensure that kids from poorer backgrounds are given equal opportunities in the educational system .
recent studies show that nowhere else in western society does a child ’ s social background have such an impact on his educational opportunities .
on thursday , german social democrat family minister renate schmidt presented a report on the situation of families in germany , compiled by an independent advisory panel .
the report highlighted the current shortcomings in the state ’ s help for parents and single mothers .
" i particularly support the part of the study that emphasizes the necessity for more financial assistance to parents in the first year after a child is born , " schmidt said .
" our election manifesto includes proposals to this effect .
we want to make sure that parents get more support for raising their kids at home - without incurring painful financial losses .

instead , klinsmann looked for more experienced players and called dietmar hamann , 31 , and christian wörns , 34 , back to the national team .
but after the team 's unconvincing play in the netherlands earlier this month , it seems klinsmann is returning to his promise to introduce new players to the lineup and revitalize germany soccer .
nine players get first cap under klinsmann klinsmann called two new faces into his squad for the upcoming friendly matches against slovakia and south africa with marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz promoted from the under-21 team .

so far klinsmann has capped nine new players since taking charge after the euro 2004 finals and continues to put the emphasis on youth .
but klinsmann is quick to contest that leaving older players like hamann off the side should not be counted as strikes against them .
" we know what didi can do , the criticism after the dutch draw had no influence " klinsmann contested .

up front , podolski will be joined by experienced strikers gerald asamoah , miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi .
klinsmann has also decided to stick to his policy of rotating goalkeepers before germany hosts the world cup next year , and left bayern munich 's oliver kahn off the roster , bringing back jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- back for the friendly trials in bratislava on sept .

it was bayern 's 500th home win in the bundesliga and set off rumors that just three weeks into the bundesliga season the championship had already been decided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehmet scholl celebrates his goal in bayern 's 3-0 win michael ballack gave munich the lead early in the second half on a free kick , and late goals from mehmet scholl and roy makaay sealed bayern 's spot on top of the bundesliga table .

" hertha were very defensive due to their injury problems and we had very few chances . "
others ca n't match bayern none of the other teams tied for first going into the weekend 's games could match the bayern result .

danish international forward jon-dahl tomasson scored his first goal since his eight million euro -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- move from ac milan , slotting home in the 50th minute to cancel out ivan klasnic 's 40th minute opener .
" the first half was even but in the second werder were far better , " trapattoni admitted .
" but we had timo hildebrand in goal . "
bremen were left ruing the dropped points as they fell two points behind bayern in the table , although they retain second spot .
" we have to be happy with the point , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were good going forward but at the back we had a few nervy moments . "

" after investigation we have ruled out any threat of a terrorist attack by these men , " a police spokesman said , adding the three had been freed during friday night . according to the police spokesperson , the three men were overheard by what is being referred to as a " credible source " at the holstenstrasse bus stop near a local railway station in the altona district of the city .
the witness told police he heard one of the men use the phrase " tomorrow we will stand as heroes before allah " before the three suspects boarded a bus heading away from the city center . hamburg police chief reinhard chedor said he was convinced that the men , aged from 21 to 25 , were the suspects caught on film by a surveillance camera boarding a bus in hamburg on wednesday .
he said one of the men was arrested and the other two had turned themselves in . control points and searches paralyze city bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 1,000 police officers mounted an operation to set up road blocks and apartments and other buildings were searched . the city 's interior minister udo nagel admitted that the size of the police operation was dictated by fears of attacks similar to those on three underground trains and a bus in london last month which killed 56 people , including the four suicide bombers .
a police statement on thursday revealed that the information regarding the operation was withheld from the public domain for 24 hours as not to jeopardize the initial criminal investigation .
suspects caught on cctv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the police also revealed that the suspects had been caught on close-circuit tv cameras and that their pictures were distributed as part of the ongoing search and investigation into their whereabouts . the operation is the result of the latest in a long line of terror alerts that hamburg has endured in the four years since it was revealed that the city was the home of a group of radical arab students led by mohamed atta , the hijack pilot who crashed the first plane into the world trade center in new york on sept .

eu member states will draw up individual lists and the european commission will combine them .
" we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said at a briefing . the idea is to prevent an airline that has been banned in one state on safety concerns from doing business in another . france and belgium have taken the lead in the 25-nation eu , announcing plans to name-and-shame carriers from monday that do not respect safety regulations . bildunterschrift : on thursday , french transport minister dominique perben said that , from monday , a list of both banned and authorized companies would appear on the french civil aviation authority 's web site " in a way that is totally transparent . " the belgian transport ministry followed suit and said it too would publish a list on monday .

eu member states will draw up individual lists and the european commission will combine them .
" we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said at a briefing . the idea is to prevent an airline that has been banned in one state on safety concerns from doing business in another . france and belgium have taken the lead in the 25-nation eu , announcing plans to name-and-shame carriers from monday that do not respect safety regulations . bildunterschrift : on thursday , french transport minister dominique perben said that , from monday , a list of both banned and authorized companies would appear on the french civil aviation authority 's web site " in a way that is totally transparent .

the witness told police he heard one of the men use the phrase " tomorrow we will stand as heroes before allah " before the three suspects boarded a bus heading away from the city center . hamburg police chief reinhard chedor said he was convinced that the men , aged from 21 to 25 , were the suspects caught on film by a surveillance camera boarding a bus in hamburg on wednesday .

it was bayern 's 500th home win in the bundesliga and set off rumors that just three weeks into the bundesliga season the championship had already been decided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehmet scholl celebrates his goal in bayern 's 3-0 win michael ballack gave munich the lead early in the second half on a free kick , and late goals from mehmet scholl and roy makaay sealed bayern 's spot on top of the bundesliga table .
" the result camouflages how the game panned out , " explained bayern manager felix magath .
" hertha were very defensive due to their injury problems and we had very few chances . "
others ca n't match bayern none of the other teams tied for first going into the weekend 's games could match the bayern result .
cologne , knocked out of the german cup last weekend , gave up their first loss 3-2 at home to kaiserslautern , and 1-1 ties were handed out in the three matches between schalke 04 and borussia mönchengladbach ; hamburg sv and hanover 96 ; and werder bremen and vfb stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's ebbe sand , right , holds off mönchengladbach 's jeff strasser last season 's runners-up , schalke suffered through the disappointing draw at home .
for the third game in a row schalke fell behind with kasper bogelund netting on 41 minutes , but ebbe sand equalized after 54 minutes , giving the royal blues a share of the points .
stuttgart ties bremen under pressure stuttgart , and especially new coach giovanni trapattoni , were under pressure to post their first win after earning just one point in two games and the fans beginning to circle like sharks around the embattled coach and the draw away in bremen did n't help the one-time italy trainer , who is still waiting for his first bundesliga win .
danish international forward jon-dahl tomasson scored his first goal since his eight million euro -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- move from ac milan , slotting home in the 50th minute to cancel out ivan klasnic 's 40th minute opener .
" the first half was even but in the second werder were far better , " trapattoni admitted .
" but we had timo hildebrand in goal . "
bremen were left ruing the dropped points as they fell two points behind bayern in the table , although they retain second spot .
" we have to be happy with the point , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were good going forward but at the back we had a few nervy moments . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg 's david jarolim , right , and hanover 's hanno balitsch fight for the ball hamburg could n't pull out a win but turned around a home losing streak against hanover with a 1-1 draw .
hanover started scoring in the 18th minute on a goal from jiri stajner .
three minutes later hamburg 's mehdi mahadivikia ended the celebrations and closed out scoring for both sides , giving hanover their third tie in as many games .
cologne falls in extra time kaiserlautern 's halil altintop , who is tied with munich 's roy makaay at the top of the scorer table , put an end to cologne 's victory march with a pair of goals .
after trailing by two going into the locker room , cologne 's matthias scherz and lukas podolski tied the game with goals in the 81st and 90th minute , only to see ervin skela cancel their work by converting a penalty in injury time and taking all three points back to kaiserslautern .
eintracht frankfurt , who joined cologne in being promoted to the german top flight this season , celebrated their first win , beating nuremberg 1-0 at home on a shot from captain jermaine jones in the 68th minute .
without a win - or even a goal - in three weeks , nuremberg seem to be making a comfortable spot for themselves in the bundesliga basement .
bildunterschrift : vfl wolfsburg got their first win and handed bayer leverkusen their second loss of the season in a slow moving 2-1 game .
demitar berbatov gave leverkusen the lead in the 22nd minute , but andres d 'alessandro and pablo thiam put in a header each to turn the score line around .
the game 's last minutes saw only nine leverkusen players leave the field as the referee sent off roque junior and marco babic with a justified red card each .

it was bayern 's 500th home win in the bundesliga and set off rumors that just three weeks into the bundesliga season the championship had already been decided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehmet scholl celebrates his goal in bayern 's 3-0 win michael ballack gave munich the lead early in the second half on a free kick , and late goals from mehmet scholl and roy makaay sealed bayern 's spot on top of the bundesliga table .

" hertha were very defensive due to their injury problems and we had very few chances . "

cologne , knocked out of the german cup last weekend , gave up their first loss 3-2 at home to kaiserslautern , and 1-1 ties were handed out in the three matches between schalke 04 and borussia mönchengladbach ; hamburg sv and hanover 96 ; and werder bremen and vfb stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's ebbe sand , right , holds off mönchengladbach 's jeff strasser last season 's runners-up , schalke suffered through the disappointing draw at home .
for the third game in a row schalke fell behind with kasper bogelund netting on 41 minutes , but ebbe sand equalized after 54 minutes , giving the royal blues a share of the points .
stuttgart ties bremen under pressure stuttgart , and especially new coach giovanni trapattoni , were under pressure to post their first win after earning just one point in two games and the fans beginning to circle like sharks around the embattled coach and the draw away in bremen did n't help the one-time italy trainer , who is still waiting for his first bundesliga win .
danish international forward jon-dahl tomasson scored his first goal since his eight million euro -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- move from ac milan , slotting home in the 50th minute to cancel out ivan klasnic 's 40th minute opener .
" the first half was even but in the second werder were far better , " trapattoni admitted .
" but we had timo hildebrand in goal . "
bremen were left ruing the dropped points as they fell two points behind bayern in the table , although they retain second spot .
" we have to be happy with the point , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .
" we were good going forward but at the back we had a few nervy moments . "

three minutes later hamburg 's mehdi mahadivikia ended the celebrations and closed out scoring for both sides , giving hanover their third tie in as many games .
cologne falls in extra time kaiserlautern 's halil altintop , who is tied with munich 's roy makaay at the top of the scorer table , put an end to cologne 's victory march with a pair of goals .
after trailing by two going into the locker room , cologne 's matthias scherz and lukas podolski tied the game with goals in the 81st and 90th minute , only to see ervin skela cancel their work by converting a penalty in injury time and taking all three points back to kaiserslautern .
eintracht frankfurt , who joined cologne in being promoted to the german top flight this season , celebrated their first win , beating nuremberg 1-0 at home on a shot from captain jermaine jones in the 68th minute .
without a win - or even a goal - in three weeks , nuremberg seem to be making a comfortable spot for themselves in the bundesliga basement .
bildunterschrift : vfl wolfsburg got their first win and handed bayer leverkusen their second loss of the season in a slow moving 2-1 game .
demitar berbatov gave leverkusen the lead in the 22nd minute , but andres d 'alessandro and pablo thiam put in a header each to turn the score line around .
the game 's last minutes saw only nine leverkusen players leave the field as the referee sent off roque junior and marco babic with a justified red card each .

a recent survey highlighted the alarming rise in child poverty in germany .
advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .
ulrich schneider , managing director of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband association of charities , said the reforms known as harz iv have led to a drastic cut in benefits for the long-term unemployed , which in turn has had a severe financial impact on thousands of children across germany .
east hit hardest the subsistence-level benefits being paid out to the needy now are too little for too many , schneider argued .
poverty among children under age 15 has risen 14.2 percent since the end of 2004 , to over 1.5 million affected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the eastern part of the country is particularly alarming , schneider said .
every third child there is poor .
the most affected areas are berlin , schwerin , goerlitz and halle .
schneider called for special payments to be granted to poor families to finance school supplies .
" it ’ s yet unclear what it means for our society if in the eastern areas , every third child lives on benefits that are far too low to enable them to take an active part in social life , " he said .
" these kids will never enjoy music courses or computer training , go to a sports club , visit a zoo and the like .
this situation is appalling . "
seeking a fix schneider also said it is vital to ensure that kids from poorer backgrounds are given equal opportunities in the educational system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.08.2005 eu airlines blacklist easier said than done großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash of a helios plane helped spur on the blacklist plan a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive . the list of airlines banned from flying in the european union due to poor safety records could be made available to passengers within six months .
eu member states will draw up individual lists and the european commission will combine them .
" we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said at a briefing . the idea is to prevent an airline that has been banned in one state on safety concerns from doing business in another . france and belgium have taken the lead in the 25-nation eu , announcing plans to name-and-shame carriers from monday that do not respect safety regulations . bildunterschrift : on thursday , french transport minister dominique perben said that , from monday , a list of both banned and authorized companies would appear on the french civil aviation authority 's web site " in a way that is totally transparent . " the belgian transport ministry followed suit and said it too would publish a list on monday . " we do n't want to wait for the future european blacklist , " a spokeswoman for belgian transport minister renaat landuyt said . previously , only britain , switzerland and the united states prepared lists either of suspect companies or of countries in which civil aviation regulations were deemed inadequate . also taking the cue from france , switzerland said thursday that it would publish its list . differing strategies but not all member states want to take such an approach to airline safety .
italy , for example , prefers to draw up a list naming companies deemed to be safe . " in our country , if a company does not meet safety norms , it does not fly .
that 's why there 's no need for a blacklist , that is , a list of companies that are n't viable , " transport minister pietro lunardi said in newspaper interviews printed friday in la stampa and la repubblica . however , an eu official pointed out that there would be a " heavy responsibility " to assume if an airplane from a carrier on the italian list crashed . " the blacklist does not say that with other companies an accident ca n't happen but that with those on the list , you are taking a risk , " the official said . common criteria although the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list . bildunterschrift : undated picture of the airplane of the colombian airline west caribbean airways that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela on aug .
16 , 2005 . " we have to set common criteria at the european level , " lamented an official at the commission .
so far belgium , france , germany and spain have spearheaded the move to bring in an eu-wide list of suspect carriers . the european commission hopes that the backing from the european parliament will focus minds on compiling such a list .
one idea under consideration would consolidate lists in each member state and apply the result across the bloc . in the long run , the commission would like to be able to impose bans eu-wide , even though member states denied the eu executive such authority in early 2004 . in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a flash airlines ' boeing airliner , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a reinforcement of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .
-lrb- aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.08.2005 eu airlines blacklist easier said than done großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash of a helios plane helped spur on the blacklist plan a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive . the list of airlines banned from flying in the european union due to poor safety records could be made available to passengers within six months .
eu member states will draw up individual lists and the european commission will combine them .
" we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said at a briefing . the idea is to prevent an airline that has been banned in one state on safety concerns from doing business in another . france and belgium have taken the lead in the 25-nation eu , announcing plans to name-and-shame carriers from monday that do not respect safety regulations . bildunterschrift : on thursday , french transport minister dominique perben said that , from monday , a list of both banned and authorized companies would appear on the french civil aviation authority 's web site " in a way that is totally transparent . " the belgian transport ministry followed suit and said it too would publish a list on monday . " we do n't want to wait for the future european blacklist , " a spokeswoman for belgian transport minister renaat landuyt said . previously , only britain , switzerland and the united states prepared lists either of suspect companies or of countries in which civil aviation regulations were deemed inadequate . also taking the cue from france , switzerland said thursday that it would publish its list . differing strategies but not all member states want to take such an approach to airline safety .
italy , for example , prefers to draw up a list naming companies deemed to be safe . " in our country , if a company does not meet safety norms , it does not fly .
that 's why there 's no need for a blacklist , that is , a list of companies that are n't viable , " transport minister pietro lunardi said in newspaper interviews printed friday in la stampa and la repubblica . however , an eu official pointed out that there would be a " heavy responsibility " to assume if an airplane from a carrier on the italian list crashed . " the blacklist does not say that with other companies an accident ca n't happen but that with those on the list , you are taking a risk , " the official said . common criteria although the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list . bildunterschrift : undated picture of the airplane of the colombian airline west caribbean airways that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela on aug .
16 , 2005 . " we have to set common criteria at the european level , " lamented an official at the commission .
so far belgium , france , germany and spain have spearheaded the move to bring in an eu-wide list of suspect carriers . the european commission hopes that the backing from the european parliament will focus minds on compiling such a list .
one idea under consideration would consolidate lists in each member state and apply the result across the bloc . in the long run , the commission would like to be able to impose bans eu-wide , even though member states denied the eu executive such authority in early 2004 . in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a flash airlines ' boeing airliner , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a reinforcement of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .
-lrb- aug .
15 , 2005 -rrb- eu air safety rules fall short although the european union has stepped up safety rules for the air transport sector in recent years , the bloc is still dogged by a lack of coordination and sometimes patchy application of existing regulations .

eu member states will draw up individual lists and the european commission will combine them .
" we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said at a briefing . the idea is to prevent an airline that has been banned in one state on safety concerns from doing business in another . france and belgium have taken the lead in the 25-nation eu , announcing plans to name-and-shame carriers from monday that do not respect safety regulations . bildunterschrift : on thursday , french transport minister dominique perben said that , from monday , a list of both banned and authorized companies would appear on the french civil aviation authority 's web site " in a way that is totally transparent .

italy , for example , prefers to draw up a list naming companies deemed to be safe . " in our country , if a company does not meet safety norms , it does not fly .
that 's why there 's no need for a blacklist , that is , a list of companies that are n't viable , " transport minister pietro lunardi said in newspaper interviews printed friday in la stampa and la repubblica . however , an eu official pointed out that there would be a " heavy responsibility " to assume if an airplane from a carrier on the italian list crashed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 27.08.2005 cologne : new team on european block ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one thought cologne would have much to celebrate this season newly promoted cologne switched divisions but after three weeks they have n't left their place near the top of the first division table .
now fans in the city on the rhine are wondering how long it can last . that bayern munich would lead the bundesliga as the season begins was clear .
that only two points would separate schalke 04 and werder bremen from the bavarians also does n't take much imagination .
but at the beginning of the month if you said cologne would be tied on points for third place you 'd have been laughed out of the stadium .
" it 's no accident that we started the season so well , " fc köln coach uwe rapolder told german public broadcaster ard .
" there was a clear , tactical process that went from my mind to the players ' . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mascot hennes gets hydrated before motivating his team but rapolder 's esoteric process also benefited from a little luck in the opening 1-0 win against mainz and the gift of a missed penalty shot goal by vfb stuttgart assured cologne a 3-2 away victory .
the real disappointment would come in the bundesliga 's third week with a 3-2 loss , this time to on an extra-time penalty kick to kaiserslautern .
mounting expectations while the players were busy staging a comeback and scoring two goals , excited cologne fans began what will no doubt be endless chants meant to push their team forward into european competition .
" as far as expectations are concerned , maybe it was n't such a bad thing to have finished three to two , " rapolder said .
despite the loss to stuttgart , rapolder 's players are piquing the interest of german national team coach jürgen klinsmann .
lukas sinkiewicz will join teammate lukas podolski on the national team for the first time when they play international friendly matches against slovakia and south africa in the early september .
bildunterschrift : growing aspirations after being fired from lr ahlen three years ago and not finding a position for over a year , rapolder knows there are bigger problems that watching his top players tire themselves out for the national team .
equipped with a new stadium , internationally respected players and a good relationship with club management the question is whether cologne will stay in front of the bundesliga 's other top teams .
exactly how much rapolder intends to achieve may change as the season progresses .
originally , his goal was not to be sent back down to the second division , but if his streak of good luck continues cologne may pull off much more .
" we 're enjoying every week we spend near the top , " rapold said .
" but we can only achieve something if we 're ready to run a lot and play for each other . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : may never fit in with locals regardless of the success rapolder brings to the city , he may never fit in with his fans who are known for consuming substantial amounts of the local kölsch-style beer before , during and especially after games .

instead , klinsmann looked for more experienced players and called dietmar hamann , 31 , and christian wörns , 34 , back to the national team .
but after the team 's unconvincing play in the netherlands earlier this month , it seems klinsmann is returning to his promise to introduce new players to the lineup and revitalize germany soccer .

so far klinsmann has capped nine new players since taking charge after the euro 2004 finals and continues to put the emphasis on youth .
but klinsmann is quick to contest that leaving older players like hamann off the side should not be counted as strikes against them .

instead , klinsmann looked for more experienced players and called dietmar hamann , 31 , and christian wörns , 34 , back to the national team .
but after the team 's unconvincing play in the netherlands earlier this month , it seems klinsmann is returning to his promise to introduce new players to the lineup and revitalize germany soccer .
nine players get first cap under klinsmann klinsmann called two new faces into his squad for the upcoming friendly matches against slovakia and south africa with marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz promoted from the under-21 team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcell jansen can celebrate being called up to the national team a defender at borussia mönchengladbach , 19-year-old jansen has made only 20 appearances in the bundesliga while cologne midfielder sinkiewicz , also 19 , has played just six times in the german top-flight .
so far klinsmann has capped nine new players since taking charge after the euro 2004 finals and continues to put the emphasis on youth .
but klinsmann is quick to contest that leaving older players like hamann off the side should not be counted as strikes against them .
" we know what didi can do , the criticism after the dutch draw had no influence " klinsmann contested .
" last season he was a late starter and went on to win the champions league . "

captain michael ballack and bernd schneider will give stability to the midfield while christian wörns , who unlike hamann is still on the current national team roster , usually holds down the defensive end .
up front , podolski will be joined by experienced strikers gerald asamoah , miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi .
klinsmann has also decided to stick to his policy of rotating goalkeepers before germany hosts the world cup next year , and left bayern munich 's oliver kahn off the roster , bringing back jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- back for the friendly trials in bratislava on sept .
3 and in bremen against south africa four days later .
bildunterschrift : kahn not going anywhere while most nations have an established number one custodian , germany rotate kahn and arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann as klinsmann believes it is good for competition ahead of the world cup .
kahn lost his undisputed mantle as the number one keeper after klinsmann was named german national coach in august 2004 and ever since then some have expected him to step away from the international competition - a move he calls " absurd . "

it was bayern 's 500th home win in the bundesliga and set off rumors that just three weeks into the bundesliga season the championship had already been decided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehmet scholl celebrates his goal in bayern 's 3-0 win michael ballack gave munich the lead early in the second half on a free kick , and late goals from mehmet scholl and roy makaay sealed bayern 's spot on top of the bundesliga table .
" the result camouflages how the game panned out , " explained bayern manager felix magath .
" hertha were very defensive due to their injury problems and we had very few chances . "
others ca n't match bayern none of the other teams tied for first going into the weekend 's games could match the bayern result .
cologne , knocked out of the german cup last weekend , gave up their first loss 3-2 at home to kaiserslautern , and 1-1 ties were handed out in the three matches between schalke 04 and borussia mönchengladbach ; hamburg sv and hanover 96 ; and werder bremen and vfb stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's ebbe sand , right , holds off mönchengladbach 's jeff strasser last season 's runners-up , schalke suffered through the disappointing draw at home .
for the third game in a row schalke fell behind with kasper bogelund netting on 41 minutes , but ebbe sand equalized after 54 minutes , giving the royal blues a share of the points .
stuttgart ties bremen under pressure stuttgart , and especially new coach giovanni trapattoni , were under pressure to post their first win after earning just one point in two games and the fans beginning to circle like sharks around the embattled coach and the draw away in bremen did n't help the one-time italy trainer , who is still waiting for his first bundesliga win .
danish international forward jon-dahl tomasson scored his first goal since his eight million euro -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- move from ac milan , slotting home in the 50th minute to cancel out ivan klasnic 's 40th minute opener .
" the first half was even but in the second werder were far better , " trapattoni admitted .
" but we had timo hildebrand in goal . "
bremen were left ruing the dropped points as they fell two points behind bayern in the table , although they retain second spot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.08.2005 eu airlines blacklist easier said than done großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash of a helios plane helped spur on the blacklist plan a series of airplane crashes has spurred european countries to ban airlines deemed unsafe , although drawing up an eu-wide list of trouble-plagued carriers - as the eu 's executive commission wants - is proving elusive . the list of airlines banned from flying in the european union due to poor safety records could be made available to passengers within six months .
eu member states will draw up individual lists and the european commission will combine them .
" we hope the list will be adopted very soon , late this year or early next year , " european commission spokesman rupert krietemeyer said at a briefing . the idea is to prevent an airline that has been banned in one state on safety concerns from doing business in another . france and belgium have taken the lead in the 25-nation eu , announcing plans to name-and-shame carriers from monday that do not respect safety regulations . bildunterschrift : on thursday , french transport minister dominique perben said that , from monday , a list of both banned and authorized companies would appear on the french civil aviation authority 's web site " in a way that is totally transparent . " the belgian transport ministry followed suit and said it too would publish a list on monday . " we do n't want to wait for the future european blacklist , " a spokeswoman for belgian transport minister renaat landuyt said . previously , only britain , switzerland and the united states prepared lists either of suspect companies or of countries in which civil aviation regulations were deemed inadequate . also taking the cue from france , switzerland said thursday that it would publish its list . differing strategies but not all member states want to take such an approach to airline safety .
italy , for example , prefers to draw up a list naming companies deemed to be safe . " in our country , if a company does not meet safety norms , it does not fly .
that 's why there 's no need for a blacklist , that is , a list of companies that are n't viable , " transport minister pietro lunardi said in newspaper interviews printed friday in la stampa and la repubblica . however , an eu official pointed out that there would be a " heavy responsibility " to assume if an airplane from a carrier on the italian list crashed . " the blacklist does not say that with other companies an accident ca n't happen but that with those on the list , you are taking a risk , " the official said . common criteria although the eu 's 25 member states agreed in april to the idea of eventually publishing the names of banned airlines , they disagree on what criteria to use for drawing up such a list . bildunterschrift : undated picture of the airplane of the colombian airline west caribbean airways that crashed in the mountains of western venezuela on aug .
16 , 2005 . " we have to set common criteria at the european level , " lamented an official at the commission .
so far belgium , france , germany and spain have spearheaded the move to bring in an eu-wide list of suspect carriers . the european commission hopes that the backing from the european parliament will focus minds on compiling such a list .
one idea under consideration would consolidate lists in each member state and apply the result across the bloc . in the long run , the commission would like to be able to impose bans eu-wide , even though member states denied the eu executive such authority in early 2004 . in january 2004 , the crash in egypt of a flash airlines ' boeing airliner , which killed 148 people , spurred the eu into action after years of negotiations and led to a reinforcement of safety checks on non-eu airplanes at airports in member states . the transport commissioner at the time , loyola de palacio , was quick to say that the accident probably would never have happened had the rules been in place . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greece and cyprus in mourning after plane crash the bodies of 119 of the 121 people on board the cypriot airliner which crashed northeast of athens as well as the plane 's second flight recorder have been recovered , greek national television reported monday .

instead , klinsmann looked for more experienced players and called dietmar hamann , 31 , and christian wörns , 34 , back to the national team .
but after the team 's unconvincing play in the netherlands earlier this month , it seems klinsmann is returning to his promise to introduce new players to the lineup and revitalize germany soccer .
nine players get first cap under klinsmann klinsmann called two new faces into his squad for the upcoming friendly matches against slovakia and south africa with marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz promoted from the under-21 team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcell jansen can celebrate being called up to the national team a defender at borussia mönchengladbach , 19-year-old jansen has made only 20 appearances in the bundesliga while cologne midfielder sinkiewicz , also 19 , has played just six times in the german top-flight .
so far klinsmann has capped nine new players since taking charge after the euro 2004 finals and continues to put the emphasis on youth .
but klinsmann is quick to contest that leaving older players like hamann off the side should not be counted as strikes against them .
" we know what didi can do , the criticism after the dutch draw had no influence " klinsmann contested .
" last season he was a late starter and went on to win the champions league . "

captain michael ballack and bernd schneider will give stability to the midfield while christian wörns , who unlike hamann is still on the current national team roster , usually holds down the defensive end .
up front , podolski will be joined by experienced strikers gerald asamoah , miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi .
klinsmann has also decided to stick to his policy of rotating goalkeepers before germany hosts the world cup next year , and left bayern munich 's oliver kahn off the roster , bringing back jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- back for the friendly trials in bratislava on sept .
3 and in bremen against south africa four days later .
bildunterschrift : kahn not going anywhere while most nations have an established number one custodian , germany rotate kahn and arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann as klinsmann believes it is good for competition ahead of the world cup .
kahn lost his undisputed mantle as the number one keeper after klinsmann was named german national coach in august 2004 and ever since then some have expected him to step away from the international competition - a move he calls " absurd . "

instead , klinsmann looked for more experienced players and called dietmar hamann , 31 , and christian wörns , 34 , back to the national team .
but after the team 's unconvincing play in the netherlands earlier this month , it seems klinsmann is returning to his promise to introduce new players to the lineup and revitalize germany soccer .
nine players get first cap under klinsmann klinsmann called two new faces into his squad for the upcoming friendly matches against slovakia and south africa with marcell jansen and lukas sinkiewicz promoted from the under-21 team .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marcell jansen can celebrate being called up to the national team a defender at borussia mönchengladbach , 19-year-old jansen has made only 20 appearances in the bundesliga while cologne midfielder sinkiewicz , also 19 , has played just six times in the german top-flight .
so far klinsmann has capped nine new players since taking charge after the euro 2004 finals and continues to put the emphasis on youth .
but klinsmann is quick to contest that leaving older players like hamann off the side should not be counted as strikes against them .
" we know what didi can do , the criticism after the dutch draw had no influence " klinsmann contested .
" last season he was a late starter and went on to win the champions league . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's kevin kuranyi , michael ballack and bernd schneider , from left , celebrate after ballack scored the first goal during the confederations cup team still has experience even with the two newcomers , the german side wo n't be without any experienced players .
captain michael ballack and bernd schneider will give stability to the midfield while christian wörns , who unlike hamann is still on the current national team roster , usually holds down the defensive end .
up front , podolski will be joined by experienced strikers gerald asamoah , miroslav klose and kevin kuranyi .
klinsmann has also decided to stick to his policy of rotating goalkeepers before germany hosts the world cup next year , and left bayern munich 's oliver kahn off the roster , bringing back jens lehmann -lrb- photo -rrb- back for the friendly trials in bratislava on sept .
3 and in bremen against south africa four days later .
bildunterschrift : kahn not going anywhere while most nations have an established number one custodian , germany rotate kahn and arsenal goalkeeper jens lehmann as klinsmann believes it is good for competition ahead of the world cup .
kahn lost his undisputed mantle as the number one keeper after klinsmann was named german national coach in august 2004 and ever since then some have expected him to step away from the international competition - a move he calls " absurd . "
" such a move does not correspond to my character , " said the bayern keeper who has won 81 caps for germany . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de attendances swell at world cup stadiums over the past five years average attendances in the bundesliga have been recorded at a respectable 30,000 but crowds have soared since the introduction of world cup stadiums last season .

it was bayern 's 500th home win in the bundesliga and set off rumors that just three weeks into the bundesliga season the championship had already been decided .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mehmet scholl celebrates his goal in bayern 's 3-0 win michael ballack gave munich the lead early in the second half on a free kick , and late goals from mehmet scholl and roy makaay sealed bayern 's spot on top of the bundesliga table .
" the result camouflages how the game panned out , " explained bayern manager felix magath .
" hertha were very defensive due to their injury problems and we had very few chances . "
others ca n't match bayern none of the other teams tied for first going into the weekend 's games could match the bayern result .
cologne , knocked out of the german cup last weekend , gave up their first loss 3-2 at home to kaiserslautern , and 1-1 ties were handed out in the three matches between schalke 04 and borussia mönchengladbach ; hamburg sv and hanover 96 ; and werder bremen and vfb stuttgart .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's ebbe sand , right , holds off mönchengladbach 's jeff strasser last season 's runners-up , schalke suffered through the disappointing draw at home .
for the third game in a row schalke fell behind with kasper bogelund netting on 41 minutes , but ebbe sand equalized after 54 minutes , giving the royal blues a share of the points .
stuttgart ties bremen under pressure stuttgart , and especially new coach giovanni trapattoni , were under pressure to post their first win after earning just one point in two games and the fans beginning to circle like sharks around the embattled coach and the draw away in bremen did n't help the one-time italy trainer , who is still waiting for his first bundesliga win .
danish international forward jon-dahl tomasson scored his first goal since his eight million euro -lrb- $ 9.8 million -rrb- move from ac milan , slotting home in the 50th minute to cancel out ivan klasnic 's 40th minute opener .
" the first half was even but in the second werder were far better , " trapattoni admitted .
" but we had timo hildebrand in goal . "
bremen were left ruing the dropped points as they fell two points behind bayern in the table , although they retain second spot .
" we have to be happy with the point , " said bremen manager thomas schaaf .

hanover started scoring in the 18th minute on a goal from jiri stajner .
three minutes later hamburg 's mehdi mahadivikia ended the celebrations and closed out scoring for both sides , giving hanover their third tie in as many games .
cologne falls in extra time kaiserlautern 's halil altintop , who is tied with munich 's roy makaay at the top of the scorer table , put an end to cologne 's victory march with a pair of goals .
after trailing by two going into the locker room , cologne 's matthias scherz and lukas podolski tied the game with goals in the 81st and 90th minute , only to see ervin skela cancel their work by converting a penalty in injury time and taking all three points back to kaiserslautern .
eintracht frankfurt , who joined cologne in being promoted to the german top flight this season , celebrated their first win , beating nuremberg 1-0 at home on a shot from captain jermaine jones in the 68th minute .
without a win - or even a goal - in three weeks , nuremberg seem to be making a comfortable spot for themselves in the bundesliga basement .

demitar berbatov gave leverkusen the lead in the 22nd minute , but andres d 'alessandro and pablo thiam put in a header each to turn the score line around .

now fans in the city on the rhine are wondering how long it can last . that bayern munich would lead the bundesliga as the season begins was clear .
that only two points would separate schalke 04 and werder bremen from the bavarians also does n't take much imagination .
but at the beginning of the month if you said cologne would be tied on points for third place you 'd have been laughed out of the stadium .
" it 's no accident that we started the season so well , " fc köln coach uwe rapolder told german public broadcaster ard .
" there was a clear , tactical process that went from my mind to the players ' . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne mascot hennes gets hydrated before motivating his team but rapolder 's esoteric process also benefited from a little luck in the opening 1-0 win against mainz and the gift of a missed penalty shot goal by vfb stuttgart assured cologne a 3-2 away victory .
the real disappointment would come in the bundesliga 's third week with a 3-2 loss , this time to on an extra-time penalty kick to kaiserslautern .
mounting expectations while the players were busy staging a comeback and scoring two goals , excited cologne fans began what will no doubt be endless chants meant to push their team forward into european competition .
" as far as expectations are concerned , maybe it was n't such a bad thing to have finished three to two , " rapolder said .
despite the loss to stuttgart , rapolder 's players are piquing the interest of german national team coach jürgen klinsmann .
lukas sinkiewicz will join teammate lukas podolski on the national team for the first time when they play international friendly matches against slovakia and south africa in the early september .
bildunterschrift : growing aspirations after being fired from lr ahlen three years ago and not finding a position for over a year , rapolder knows there are bigger problems that watching his top players tire themselves out for the national team .
equipped with a new stadium , internationally respected players and a good relationship with club management the question is whether cologne will stay in front of the bundesliga 's other top teams .
exactly how much rapolder intends to achieve may change as the season progresses .
originally , his goal was not to be sent back down to the second division , but if his streak of good luck continues cologne may pull off much more .
" we 're enjoying every week we spend near the top , " rapold said .
" but we can only achieve something if we 're ready to run a lot and play for each other . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : may never fit in with locals regardless of the success rapolder brings to the city , he may never fit in with his fans who are known for consuming substantial amounts of the local kölsch-style beer before , during and especially after games .

a recent survey highlighted the alarming rise in child poverty in germany .
advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .
ulrich schneider , managing director of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband association of charities , said the reforms known as harz iv have led to a drastic cut in benefits for the long-term unemployed , which in turn has had a severe financial impact on thousands of children across germany .
east hit hardest the subsistence-level benefits being paid out to the needy now are too little for too many , schneider argued .
poverty among children under age 15 has risen 14.2 percent since the end of 2004 , to over 1.5 million affected .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation in the eastern part of the country is particularly alarming , schneider said .
every third child there is poor .
the most affected areas are berlin , schwerin , goerlitz and halle .
schneider called for special payments to be granted to poor families to finance school supplies .
" it ’ s yet unclear what it means for our society if in the eastern areas , every third child lives on benefits that are far too low to enable them to take an active part in social life , " he said .
" these kids will never enjoy music courses or computer training , go to a sports club , visit a zoo and the like .
this situation is appalling . "
seeking a fix schneider also said it is vital to ensure that kids from poorer backgrounds are given equal opportunities in the educational system .
recent studies show that nowhere else in western society does a child ’ s social background have such an impact on his educational opportunities .
on thursday , german social democrat family minister renate schmidt presented a report on the situation of families in germany , compiled by an independent advisory panel .
the report highlighted the current shortcomings in the state ’ s help for parents and single mothers .
" i particularly support the part of the study that emphasizes the necessity for more financial assistance to parents in the first year after a child is born , " schmidt said .
" our election manifesto includes proposals to this effect .
we want to make sure that parents get more support for raising their kids at home - without incurring painful financial losses .

now a government study has finally recognized this phenomenon .
-lrb- may 1 , 2005 -rrb- child poverty rises in germany the number of children in german living in poverty is rising faster than in most other industrialized nations , according to a new report .
children of single parents and immigrant families are especially threatened .

a recent survey highlighted the alarming rise in child poverty in germany .
advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .
ulrich schneider , managing director of the paritätisch wohlfahrtsverband association of charities , said the reforms known as harz iv have led to a drastic cut in benefits for the long-term unemployed , which in turn has had a severe financial impact on thousands of children across germany .
east hit hardest the subsistence-level benefits being paid out to the needy now are too little for too many , schneider argued .
poverty among children under age 15 has risen 14.2 percent since the end of 2004 , to over 1.5 million affected .

the report highlighted the current shortcomings in the state ’ s help for parents and single mothers .
" i particularly support the part of the study that emphasizes the necessity for more financial assistance to parents in the first year after a child is born , " schmidt said .

advocacy groups blame recent changes in the social welfare system . a leading social welfare support group says child poverty has reached a new peak in germany 's post-world war ii history .

' artificial satellite ' the container , which also included a turkmen flag and presidential standard , was launched as part of a mission to place two japanese research satellites in orbit .
" the book that conquered the hearts of millions on earth is now conquering space , " said an article in the official neitralny turkmenistan newspaper .

men on average wanted their ex to keep 19 items from a list of 24 including the home , photographs and pets , while women wanted the men to get just eight .
while women did not particularly want items including the television , cds , dvds , and toaster , they were keen their ex-husband did not get them .
yougov polled 3,515 people in may and june for yorkshire building society .
the poll found men were keen for their ex to keep items including the bed , television , wedding album , lawnmower and garden accessories , house plants , coffee machine , monopoly board and the family pet .
emotional attachment one item that men were determined to keep for themselves was the house - 32 % wanted it to keep it outright , compared with 30 % who were happy to wholly hand it over to their ex-wife .
the men also wanted the car , the laptop computer , digital camera and cd and dvd collections .

ultimately 46 % of women did keep the house , compared with 29 % of men , with other couples selling .
denise knowles , a counsellor at relate , said : " these findings reflect the hugely different emotional attachment that divorcing men and women feel towards their shared possessions .
" men are far keener than women to put their past behind them and want to move on , which is why they are happy to let their ex keep almost all of their shared possessions - apart from those items that provide entertainment such as the car , digital camera and music system .
" women , by contrast , have a far greater emotional attachment to their home and its contents , seeing these things as the fabric of their lives and things that should be preserved both for themselves and any children as symbols of their family history and life . "

men on average wanted their ex to keep 19 items from a list of 24 including the home , photographs and pets , while women wanted the men to get just eight .
while women did not particularly want items including the television , cds , dvds , and toaster , they were keen their ex-husband did not get them .
yougov polled 3,515 people in may and june for yorkshire building society .
the poll found men were keen for their ex to keep items including the bed , television , wedding album , lawnmower and garden accessories , house plants , coffee machine , monopoly board and the family pet .
emotional attachment one item that men were determined to keep for themselves was the house - 32 % wanted it to keep it outright , compared with 30 % who were happy to wholly hand it over to their ex-wife .
the men also wanted the car , the laptop computer , digital camera and cd and dvd collections .
half of women wanted the family home outright , but even more - 64 % - wanted the dog or cat .
women have a far greater emotional attachment to their home and its contents relate counsellor denise knowles they were happy for their former husband to keep the bed , sofa , lawnmower , coffee machine , laptop , digital camera , playstation and any wine and drinks they had .
ultimately 46 % of women did keep the house , compared with 29 % of men , with other couples selling .
denise knowles , a counsellor at relate , said : " these findings reflect the hugely different emotional attachment that divorcing men and women feel towards their shared possessions .
" men are far keener than women to put their past behind them and want to move on , which is why they are happy to let their ex keep almost all of their shared possessions - apart from those items that provide entertainment such as the car , digital camera and music system .
" women , by contrast , have a far greater emotional attachment to their home and its contents , seeing these things as the fabric of their lives and things that should be preserved both for themselves and any children as symbols of their family history and life . "
but the divorce recovery workshop , a charity which helps people deal with separation , said it was difficult to make generalisations .
" some men can be vindictive .
many women are certainly not vindictive , " its spokesman peter allen told bbc radio five live .

the police and the city council have teamed up with other agencies to launch the two-month safe nottingham scheme .
officers will be out in force from this weekend to tackle under-age drinkers , anti-social behaviour and disorder .
but supt dave colbeck said the policy is likely to lead to more arrests - and hence higher crime rate figures .
mr colbeck said : " what people may see when reports come out subsequently is an apparent increase in anti-social behaviour .
" what people should understand is that if we are proactively out there issuing fixed penalty notices to people and arresting people for disorder offences , then you will get an increase in those figures . "
