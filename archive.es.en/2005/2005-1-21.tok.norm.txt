program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 bundestag wants to close visa loopholes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german embassies , like this one in havana , have been too lenient are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?
opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .
second , his purpose for travelling here has to be authentic and thirdly , their intention to return home needs to be closely examined , " said uhl .
" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .
by inferring that the government is letting in terrorists , illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals , the cdu is doing nothing more than " trying to play on people 's fears for their own gain , " said kerstin müller , a ministry undersecretary . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .
second , his purpose for travelling here has to be authentic and thirdly , their intention to return home needs to be closely examined , " said uhl .
" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .
by inferring that the government is letting in terrorists , illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals , the cdu is doing nothing more than " trying to play on people 's fears for their own gain , " said kerstin müller , a ministry undersecretary . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .
also , the space shuttle discovery is expected to fly again , and china is set to launch its second manned flight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 bundestag wants to close visa loopholes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german embassies , like this one in havana , have been too lenient are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?
opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .
second , his purpose for travelling here has to be authentic and thirdly , their intention to return home needs to be closely examined , " said uhl .
" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

thanks to an idea by ulrike brucher , a businesswoman who owns a local lingerie shop , women in these emergency situations can pop into the ladies ' room , drop € 6 -lrb- about $ 7.70 -rrb- into a vending machine , and emerge wearing a slinky thong .
it will not only do away with pesky panty lines , it 'll ensure that at the critical moment , the erotic charge wo n't be short circuited . you might call it the thong-o-mat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrike brucher displays her thong-o-mat .
the machines themselves are n't new , it 's just that they normally stock condoms or tampons .
brucher 's version now features black thongs in small , medium or large , and includes a toothpaste tablet so you can make sure your breath is at its freshest . brucher originally just stocked two such machines , thinking they 'd be good advertising for her store .
but after word got out , she received requests for the " thong-o-mats " from frankfurt , leipzig , cologne , berlin and other cities . the ones in the two stuttgart bars have to be refilled every week these days as more women are deciding for a last-minute lingerie switch .
they 're simply leaving the ugly undies behind .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 parliament debates anti-discrimination law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : age discrimination would be prohibited by the new law the german parliament has debated a proposed anti-discrimination law put forward by the government .
based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
teltschik said that many us senators were expected to be in attendance . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuit against rumsfeld threatens us-german relations the pentagon made thinly veiled threats on monday , suggesting us-german relations could be at risk if a criminal complaint filed in german courts over abu ghraib proceeds .

in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen .

he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .
the impressive midfielder barbarez , hamburg 's best player on the day , toiled tirelessly to the end but the back of the hsv team was broken .

" children in the countryside are the future , " fischer boel said .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
teltschik said that many us senators were expected to be in attendance . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuit against rumsfeld threatens us-german relations the pentagon made thinly veiled threats on monday , suggesting us-german relations could be at risk if a criminal complaint filed in german courts over abu ghraib proceeds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 bundestag wants to close visa loopholes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german embassies , like this one in havana , have been too lenient are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?
opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .
second , his purpose for travelling here has to be authentic and thirdly , their intention to return home needs to be closely examined , " said uhl .
" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .
by inferring that the government is letting in terrorists , illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals , the cdu is doing nothing more than " trying to play on people 's fears for their own gain , " said kerstin müller , a ministry undersecretary . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .
second , his purpose for travelling here has to be authentic and thirdly , their intention to return home needs to be closely examined , " said uhl .
" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .
by inferring that the government is letting in terrorists , illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals , the cdu is doing nothing more than " trying to play on people 's fears for their own gain , " said kerstin müller , a ministry undersecretary . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .
the impressive midfielder barbarez , hamburg 's best player on the day , toiled tirelessly to the end but the back of the hsv team was broken .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .
also , the space shuttle discovery is expected to fly again , and china is set to launch its second manned flight .

in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .
also , the space shuttle discovery is expected to fly again , and china is set to launch its second manned flight .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

no fear , now you can pop into the powder room and pick up a sexy thong that 's sure to impress . it 's like a scene from the tv show " sex and the city . "
you 're out on the town having a great time and you run into sexy mr. right , or at least mr. right now .

it will not only do away with pesky panty lines , it 'll ensure that at the critical moment , the erotic charge wo n't be short circuited . you might call it the thong-o-mat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrike brucher displays her thong-o-mat .
the machines themselves are n't new , it 's just that they normally stock condoms or tampons .
brucher 's version now features black thongs in small , medium or large , and includes a toothpaste tablet so you can make sure your breath is at its freshest . brucher originally just stocked two such machines , thinking they 'd be good advertising for her store .
but after word got out , she received requests for the " thong-o-mats " from frankfurt , leipzig , cologne , berlin and other cities . the ones in the two stuttgart bars have to be refilled every week these days as more women are deciding for a last-minute lingerie switch .
they 're simply leaving the ugly undies behind .

opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .

for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .

" organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

no fear , now you can pop into the powder room and pick up a sexy thong that 's sure to impress . it 's like a scene from the tv show " sex and the city . "
you 're out on the town having a great time and you run into sexy mr. right , or at least mr. right now .
things between you two are progressing nicely , when a flash hits you : in the rush to get out of the house , you threw on your ugliest pair of girdle-like panties .
that 's sure to throw ice on the erotic heat should things really get going . but now you have an option , at least if you live in stuttgart .
thanks to an idea by ulrike brucher , a businesswoman who owns a local lingerie shop , women in these emergency situations can pop into the ladies ' room , drop € 6 -lrb- about $ 7.70 -rrb- into a vending machine , and emerge wearing a slinky thong .
it will not only do away with pesky panty lines , it 'll ensure that at the critical moment , the erotic charge wo n't be short circuited . you might call it the thong-o-mat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrike brucher displays her thong-o-mat .
the machines themselves are n't new , it 's just that they normally stock condoms or tampons .
brucher 's version now features black thongs in small , medium or large , and includes a toothpaste tablet so you can make sure your breath is at its freshest . brucher originally just stocked two such machines , thinking they 'd be good advertising for her store .
but after word got out , she received requests for the " thong-o-mats " from frankfurt , leipzig , cologne , berlin and other cities . the ones in the two stuttgart bars have to be refilled every week these days as more women are deciding for a last-minute lingerie switch .
they 're simply leaving the ugly undies behind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 bundestag wants to close visa loopholes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german embassies , like this one in havana , have been too lenient are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?
opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .
also , the space shuttle discovery is expected to fly again , and china is set to launch its second manned flight .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 parliament debates anti-discrimination law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : age discrimination would be prohibited by the new law the german parliament has debated a proposed anti-discrimination law put forward by the government .
based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .
also , the space shuttle discovery is expected to fly again , and china is set to launch its second manned flight .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
teltschik said that many us senators were expected to be in attendance . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuit against rumsfeld threatens us-german relations the pentagon made thinly veiled threats on monday , suggesting us-german relations could be at risk if a criminal complaint filed in german courts over abu ghraib proceeds .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .
also , the space shuttle discovery is expected to fly again , and china is set to launch its second manned flight .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "

the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .

unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .
also , the space shuttle discovery is expected to fly again , and china is set to launch its second manned flight .
for astronomy buffs , the year 2005 will be an exciting one . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de huygens pictures unveil surface of titan the european space agency on saturday said the first pictures of saturn 's moon titan taken by the huygens probe showed what appeared to be rivulets winding their way towards the shoreline of a vast ocean .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 parliament debates anti-discrimination law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : age discrimination would be prohibited by the new law the german parliament has debated a proposed anti-discrimination law put forward by the government .
based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .
the impressive midfielder barbarez , hamburg 's best player on the day , toiled tirelessly to the end but the back of the hsv team was broken .

pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .
the impressive midfielder barbarez , hamburg 's best player on the day , toiled tirelessly to the end but the back of the hsv team was broken .
bayern are now three points ahead of their nearest challengers , schalke 04 .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .
the impressive midfielder barbarez , hamburg 's best player on the day , toiled tirelessly to the end but the back of the hsv team was broken .
bayern are now three points ahead of their nearest challengers , schalke 04 .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .
the impressive midfielder barbarez , hamburg 's best player on the day , toiled tirelessly to the end but the back of the hsv team was broken .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 parliament debates anti-discrimination law großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : age discrimination would be prohibited by the new law the german parliament has debated a proposed anti-discrimination law put forward by the government .
based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .

uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .

" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .

opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .
second , his purpose for travelling here has to be authentic and thirdly , their intention to return home needs to be closely examined , " said uhl .
" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
teltschik said that many us senators were expected to be in attendance . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuit against rumsfeld threatens us-german relations the pentagon made thinly veiled threats on monday , suggesting us-german relations could be at risk if a criminal complaint filed in german courts over abu ghraib proceeds .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
teltschik said that many us senators were expected to be in attendance . dw staff -lrb- lu -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de lawsuit against rumsfeld threatens us-german relations the pentagon made thinly veiled threats on monday , suggesting us-german relations could be at risk if a criminal complaint filed in german courts over abu ghraib proceeds .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law . "
while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .
" it will make german labor law , which is already heavily regulated , even more complicated , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's current anti-discrimination rules at the workplace focus mostly on women and the disabled .
the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda . " germany pulling up the rear germany is one of the few eu countries that has not made the guidelines from brussels into law .
most other member states passed laws meeting the requirements in 2003 or 2004 .
a draft law was presented in 2001 by then-justice minister herta däubler-gmelin but was withdrawn after a torrent a criticism . the delay prompted eu regulators in december to sue germany , along with greece , austria , finland and luxembourg for failing to pass anti-discrimination laws . the legislation is expected to be passed in the spring since it does not need approval of the upper house of parliament , or bundesrat , where the opposition has a majority . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de doing away with discrimination the german government plans to introduce a law banning discrimination in a wide range of areas .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .
the impressive midfielder barbarez , hamburg 's best player on the day , toiled tirelessly to the end but the back of the hsv team was broken .
bayern are now three points ahead of their nearest challengers , schalke 04 .

the machines themselves are n't new , it 's just that they normally stock condoms or tampons .
brucher 's version now features black thongs in small , medium or large , and includes a toothpaste tablet so you can make sure your breath is at its freshest . brucher originally just stocked two such machines , thinking they 'd be good advertising for her store .
but after word got out , she received requests for the " thong-o-mats " from frankfurt , leipzig , cologne , berlin and other cities . the ones in the two stuttgart bars have to be refilled every week these days as more women are deciding for a last-minute lingerie switch .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 bundestag wants to close visa loopholes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german embassies , like this one in havana , have been too lenient are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?
opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.01.2005 bundestag wants to close visa loopholes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german embassies , like this one in havana , have been too lenient are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?
opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .
second , his purpose for travelling here has to be authentic and thirdly , their intention to return home needs to be closely examined , " said uhl .
" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .
by inferring that the government is letting in terrorists , illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals , the cdu is doing nothing more than " trying to play on people 's fears for their own gain , " said kerstin müller , a ministry undersecretary . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .

some say the cancellation is likely due to a war crimes complaint against him that was filed in a german court . the head of the security conference , horst teltschik , said in friday 's edition of the münchner abendzeitung newspaper that rumsfeld will instead send the number three official at the pentagon , douglas j. feith , the undersecretary of defense for policy .
" this will disappoint many people in europe , because there is a real need for discussions about the iran crisis , " teltschik told afp .
rumsfeld has excused himself from the high-profile talks on international defense policy claiming prior commitments .
however , some have speculated that his decision not to attend the meeting was influenced by a complaint filed against him by a new york-based human rights group , the center for constitutional rights .
in december , the group filed a complaint with the federal german prosecutor 's office against rumsfeld , accusing him of war crimes and torture due to his involvement in the war in iraq .
the defense secretary later sent a message to the german government through the us embassy in berlin that he would not attend the munich meeting if there is a chance a case will be launched against him in germany .
however , when he informed the german government he would not take part in the conference , he did not refer to the charges filed against him .
among the participants expected to attend the february 11 to 13 meeting of security experts from around the world are un secretary general kofi annan , german president horst köhler and german chancellor gerhard schröder .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .

ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .

the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .
the impressive midfielder barbarez , hamburg 's best player on the day , toiled tirelessly to the end but the back of the hsv team was broken .
bayern are now three points ahead of their nearest challengers , schalke 04 .

based on a series of eu directives , the draft law goes even further .
critics say it will create more bureaucracy . the anti-discrimination law , which had its first reading in the bundestag on friday , would make punishable discrimination based on race , ethnic origin , age , sex , disability , religion or sexual orientation .
the aim is to prevent discriminatory practices at the workplace , in educational institutions , or , for example , by landlords . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volker beck , parliamentary floor leader of the green party , called the law an " important signal " for german society .
speaking before the legislative body , he listed what he said were several common discriminatory practices in germany : women forced to pay higher premiums for health insurance ; homosexuals refused life insurance policies ; or disabled people not being allowed to stay at resort hotels , on the reasoning that other guests might be disturbed by their presence . " that is a monstrosity that we want to stop , " he said . the legal expert for the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , olaf scholz , told parliamentarians that the proposed law was " pragmatic " and should not pose a problem for any " decent citizen . "
he said the legislation aims to make the already self-evident ban on discrimination between the state and the population apply equally to relationships between citizens . added bureaucracy but the draft law has run into harsh criticism from both opposition politicians and industry and trade groups , who say it will only create more bureaucracy and could hinder economic growth . the opposition accused the governing coalition of social democrats and greens of trying to promote a particular ideology with the " cudgel of the law .

while the two conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said the protection of the disabled and equality between men and women were important , the proposed anti-discrimination law was not the right approach to ensure this . karl-josef lauman of the opposition christian democratic union said the proposed law went far beyond the requirements of the european union , which requires a ban only on discrimination based on race or ethnic origin .
he added that the law was " a further step towards making the country more bureaucratic . " bad for the economy anton wirmer , an adviser for the german trade association bag , told reporters it would hurt attempts to make it easier to do business in the country .

the new law will expand on this and ease the burden of proof needed to sue a company over , for example , its personnel decisions .
up to now , workers in germany have relied on the country 's general dismissal protection . " this -lsb- law -rsb- will ensure even more bureaucracy and small and medium-sized companies will suffer , " said maria eichhorn , a parliamentarian with the conservative christian social union . she warned of a flood of lawsuits , an accusation that the spd 's scholz dismissed as " propaganda .

opposition politicians think so and want the foreign minister to appear before parliamentary hearings on the issue . to hear germany 's chief opposition party tell it , the country 's embassies might as well be smuggling bands in the way they let foreigners into the country . in the past year , german diplomats in ukraine , russia , albania , among other countries , have been slammed at home for being too lax on who they let into the country .
christian democrat parliamentarian hans-peter uhl said the german foreign ministry 's laziness in reviewing visa applications has only encouraged prostitution and human smugglers . " organized crime is benefiting … from the foreign ministry , " said uhl . sri lankan handballers benefit beginning wednesday , uhl is heading a parliamentary committee charged with examining the role of the foreign ministry and its head , joschka fischer , in the approval of thousands of incomplete or unverified visa applications in recent years .
opposition politicians called for the hearings after german law enforcement complained that criminals were granted easy entry to germany on falsified documents . in 2001 , the german embassy in kiev , ukraine approved 400,000 visas , an unusually high number considering the 190 german embassies worldwide issue 3 million visas each year on average . in 2003 , a judge in cologne handed down a mild sentence to the head of a smuggling ring , saying the foreign ministry made it too easy for him . last september , in perhaps the most comical episode of lax entry rules , a group of sri lankans advertising themselves as the national handball team were granted visas for a tournament in munich .
tournament officials started getting suspicious when it was clear the sri lankans had no idea how to play the game .
before they could be deported , they disappeared , allegedly travelling to the large and tight-knit sri lankan community in italy . tighter rules not tight enough the foreign ministry reacted to the criticism that erupted following the incident by promising tighter regulations .
under the microscope is a policy from 2000 that allowed more flexibility to people applying for entry in germany .
for example , they were allowed to mail in their applications , rather than stand in long lines at the embassy and questionable applications were often given the benefit of the doubt . now , the ministry wants to create , among other things , a databank that roots out people who apply repeatedly for visas to germany .
uhl says that 's not enough . " if a foreigner wants a visa he needs to first be able to finance the trip .
second , his purpose for travelling here has to be authentic and thirdly , their intention to return home needs to be closely examined , " said uhl .
" that is still not done . " foreign ministry officials are calling the opposition 's complaints populistic and misguiding .
by inferring that the government is letting in terrorists , illegal workers , prostitutes and criminals , the cdu is doing nothing more than " trying to play on people 's fears for their own gain , " said kerstin müller , a ministry undersecretary . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government says immigrant wave receding in germany immigration into germany in the year 2003 , for the first time in many decades , dropped below 800,000 as the influx of foreigners throughout the 1990s has receded , according to government statistics released on monday .

no fear , now you can pop into the powder room and pick up a sexy thong that 's sure to impress . it 's like a scene from the tv show " sex and the city . "
you 're out on the town having a great time and you run into sexy mr. right , or at least mr. right now .
things between you two are progressing nicely , when a flash hits you : in the rush to get out of the house , you threw on your ugliest pair of girdle-like panties .
that 's sure to throw ice on the erotic heat should things really get going . but now you have an option , at least if you live in stuttgart .
thanks to an idea by ulrike brucher , a businesswoman who owns a local lingerie shop , women in these emergency situations can pop into the ladies ' room , drop € 6 -lrb- about $ 7.70 -rrb- into a vending machine , and emerge wearing a slinky thong .
it will not only do away with pesky panty lines , it 'll ensure that at the critical moment , the erotic charge wo n't be short circuited . you might call it the thong-o-mat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrike brucher displays her thong-o-mat .
the machines themselves are n't new , it 's just that they normally stock condoms or tampons .
brucher 's version now features black thongs in small , medium or large , and includes a toothpaste tablet so you can make sure your breath is at its freshest . brucher originally just stocked two such machines , thinking they 'd be good advertising for her store .
but after word got out , she received requests for the " thong-o-mats " from frankfurt , leipzig , cologne , berlin and other cities . the ones in the two stuttgart bars have to be refilled every week these days as more women are deciding for a last-minute lingerie switch .
they 're simply leaving the ugly undies behind .
cleaning personnel at one of the bars report finding more and more pairs of panties in the toilet trash cans . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de for germans and their undies , parting is sweet sorrow a recent survey on germans and their hygiene habits may leave a stain on the teutonic reputation for cleanliness : it says more than a third of the country 's men don ’ t change their underwear every day .
-lrb- july 6 , 2004 -rrb- money over sex any day given the choice between hot sex and cold , hard cash , germans say they 'll take the dough .
a new survey reveals germans would prefer less erotic satisfaction in 2005 and more of the pecuniary sort .

" children in the countryside are the future , " fischer boel said .

he said he was pleased to see the chancellor campaigning for the automobile or airbus industry , but added that " farming is also economy .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .
three goals down and hamburg 's spirited challenge was over .

while they suffered a few minor scares and were forced to fight some hard battles , bayern munich showed the rest of the bundesliga that there was no over indulgence over christmas by taking off where they had finished .
hamburg sv were no match for the league leaders who battled to a 3-0 victory in the olympic stadium on friday night .
the winter break did n't seem to have any adverse effects on felix magath 's side as goals from claudio pizarro , bastian schweinsteiger and roy makaay secured the points and kept bayern on top of the league ahead of schalke 04 who play on saturday .
hamburg could have beaten a different side on any other day .
they ran hard , played neat passing movements and threatened oliver kahn 's goal on many occassions but bayern were different class .
pizarro 's looping header in the first half looked to be a crowning moment of the game but the exquisite one-two between bastian schweinsteiger and mehmet scholl which opened up the defense in the early minutes of the second half eclipsed that .
the young bayern man fought off two defenders to squeeze a shot under hsv keeper pieckenhagen for the second goal .
then it was the master finisher makaay who iced the cake .
a sublime lob from a long thorsten frings through ball made it 3-0 and crowned an exhibition performance .

not only did the space probe huygens successfully land on saturn moon titan 's surface , it was able to send back breathtaking photos from the surface along with valuable data . in the week since it landed , esa has had time to analyze the data huygens sent back to earth and the results are exciting , according to the experts at the space agency , who held a celebration press conference in paris on friday .
bildunterschrift : the lander huygens flew to saturn with cassini which in turn relayed the first photos from titan 's surface earth-like processes ?
" there is liquid on titan .
it has rained long ago ; there is liquid methane , " said jean-pierre leberton , director of the huygens mission at esa .
in order for methane to exist in a liquid form , temperatures on titan 's surface must be below -179 degrees celsius .
in addition to finding traces of methane on both the moon 's surface and in its atmosphere , huygens also found evidence of nitrogen .
oxygen , however was not found on titan , which is probably a good thing , as atmospheric scientist toby owen explained , otherwise the planet " would have exploded a long time ago . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an european space agency image beamed back by huygens , showing short , stubby drainage channels leading to a shoreline .
us researcher marty tamasko of the university of arizona , who was allowed a rare look at the data sent back by huygens , said titan 's surface shows evidence of remarkably earthlike processes , such as abrasion , erosion and precipitation .
while huygens only relayed a few hours ' worth of information , scientists expect to spend years analyzing its findings and interpreting what it means for the earth 's development .
ambitious future plans the breathtaking success of the huygens mission is the first highlight of a year packed with esa launches .
a european rocket will set off in the fall for a journey to venus .
the final goal for european scientists is to send probes to the other three planets of the inner solar system .
the first leg got underway in january 2004 when esa attempted to land its mars express on the red planet .
unlike the huygens endeavor , however , the mars express and its on-board probe the beagle , failed to land successfully and transmit data from the planet 's surface . the crash and burn was a major embarrassment to europe , especially after nasa succeed in landing two of its probes shortly thereafter .
but the mars express disaster has not dampend the frontier spirit of esa as it pushes ahead with even more ambitious projects including a manned-mission to mars in the next 20 years .
more tangible is the bepicolombo mission planned for 2012 , which will explore mercury , the planet closest to the sun .
in the more commercial field , europe is scheduled to launch the first galileo satellite which will create a new navigational web for earth .
it promises to exceed the capabilities of the us-run gps system .
the rest of the world is not standing idly by .
on july 4 , the us probe deep impact is expected to smash into the comet tempel 1 to gain information about the solar orbiters .
also , the space shuttle discovery is expected to fly again , and china is set to launch its second manned flight .
for astronomy buffs , the year 2005 will be an exciting one . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de huygens pictures unveil surface of titan the european space agency on saturday said the first pictures of saturn 's moon titan taken by the huygens probe showed what appeared to be rivulets winding their way towards the shoreline of a vast ocean .

leics county council has been awarded lottery money to celebrate the 1485 battle , near hinckley .
there will be a new education room to allow a " hands-on experience " at the bosworth battlefield centre .
peter winkless , council chairman , said it will provide visitors with an " even more " enjoyable experience .
he added : " the funding will be used to uncover and provide access to real facts about the battle and expend on the wealth and artefacts and objects already on display . "
the battle ushered in the tudor dynasty the money will be spent on replicas to show the weapons , armour and costume fittings of the period .
there will be an archaeological and geographical survey to determine the exact site of the battle with field walking , historic mapping and environmental studies over the coming years .
the idea is to pinpoint the exact location of the battle which changed the course of english history , as king richard iii was defeated by henry tudor .
visitors currently have to settle for a field and are told what is likely to have happened on the site .
the last major investment in the site was for the 500th anniversary in 1985 , and visitor numbers have dropped off since .
the site cafe , known as the buttery and housed in a temporary cabin , was condemned on safety grounds .

mr king 's speech came ahead of friday 's publication of the first official retail sales figures for december .
with a number of store groups having already reported poor trading over the festive period , the office for national statistics -lrb- ons -rrb- figures could be weak .
yet mr king said any month 's retail figures were " not always a good guide " .
and a number of retailers - most notably tesco - have reported strong festive sales .
patience call economists assess retail sales data for clues to any future movements in interest rates , which are decided by the bank of england 's monetary policy committee . "
the most important lesson from past experience is that , whatever the number turns out to be , it is foolish to put too much weight on any month 's figure , particularly at christmas " mervyn king mr king cautioned against any snap reactions to the december figures from the ons , saying " the true meaning of the christmas story " would not be revealed until easter and possibly much later .
" the monetary policy committee is more concerned to discern the meaning of the path of consumer spending over a longer time horizon , " he added .
" the most important lesson from past experience is that , whatever the number turns out to be , it is foolish to put too much weight on any month 's figure , particularly at christmas , " mixed christmas mr king added that households only use about 40 % of their budgets on the high street and that retail sales figures were " not always a good guide " to spending habits .
a number of retailers have said their christmas trading period was disappointing .
these include morrisons , woolworths , house of fraser , marks & spencer and big food .
a british retail consortium survey found that christmas 2004 was the worst for 10 years .
yet at the same time a number of other retailers reported festive sales well up on last year , including hmv , monsoon , jessops , body shop , as well as tesco .

the admission is part of an apology sent to jp morgan staff after the bank researched its links to slavery in order to meet legislation in chicago .
citizens bank and canal bank are the two lenders that were identified .
they are now closed , but were linked to bank one , which jp morgan bought last year .
about 13,000 slaves were used as loan collateral between 1831 and 1865 .

because of defaults by plantation owners , citizens and canal ended up owning about 1,250 slaves .
" we all know slavery existed in our country , but it is quite different to see how our history and the institution of slavery were intertwined , " jp morgan chief executive william harrison and chief operating officer james dimon said in the letter .
" slavery was tragically ingrained in american society , but that is no excuse . "
" we apologise to the african-american community , particularly those who are descendants of slaves , and to the rest of the american public for the role that citizens bank and canal bank played . "
" the slavery era was a tragic time in us history and in our company 's history . "
jp morgan said that it was setting up a $ 5m scholarship programme for students living in louisiana , the state where the events took place .
the bank said that it is a " very different company than the citizens and canal banks of the 1800s " .

once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year , firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology .
the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january .
the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january .
william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music , movies and software .
since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down , the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology , blaming it for falling sales and piracy .
but that is going to change very soon , according to the panel .
control and cash the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks .
but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content , said travis kalanick , founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh , and soon they are all going to want a slice of it .
they are just waiting to come up with " business models " that work for them , which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards .
when they ca n't stop it , they try to control it .
then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money michael weiss , streamcast networks but , until the legal actions are resolved , experimentation with p2p can not not happen , said michael weiss , president of streamcast networks .
remembering the furore around vcrs when they first came out , mr weiss said : " old media always tries to stop new media .
" when they ca n't stop it , they try to control it .
then they figure out how to make money and they always make a lot of money . "
once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology , the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business .
in august 2004 , the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast , two file-sharing networks .
the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle , and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal .
legal too p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files .
instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients .
there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways .
p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file , like photos , free software , licensed music and any other digital content .
the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology .
it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them .
the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control .
but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many .
the global entertainment industry says more than 2.6 billion copyrighted music files are downloaded every month , and about half a million films are downloaded a day .
legal music download services , like apple itunes , napster , have rushed into the music marketplace to try and lure file-sharers away from free content .
sales of legally-downloaded songs grew tenfold in 2004 , with 200 million tracks bought online in the us and europe in 12 months , the ifpi reported this week .
but such download services are very different from p2p networks , not least because of the financial aspect .
creating their own there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies .
paid-for-pass-along , in which firms receive money each time a file is shared , along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered .
" we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p , " said marc morgenstern , vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer .
file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg derek broes , microsoft " consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together , " agreed mr morgenstern .
but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry 's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations .
unsigned bands , for example , use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively , which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign .
" increasingly , what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content , " said derek broes , from microsoft .
" they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread , " he said .
looking into p2p 's future , file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks , as far as mr broes is concerned .
" once some of these issues are resolved , you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content , but also in ways that are unimaginable now , " he said .
" file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg . "

but such download services are very different from p2p networks , not least because of the financial aspect .
creating their own there are several money-spinning models that could turn p2p into a golden egg for commercial entertainment companies .
paid-for-pass-along , in which firms receive money each time a file is shared , along with various drm solutions and advertiser-based options are all being considered .
" we see there are going to be different models for commoditising p2p , " said marc morgenstern , vice president of anti-piracy firm overpeer .
file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg derek broes , microsoft " consumers are hungry for it and we will discover new models together , " agreed mr morgenstern .
but many net users will continue to ignore the entertainment industry 's potential controlling grip on content and p2p technology by continuing to use it for their own creations .
unsigned bands , for example , use p2p networks to distribute their music effectively , which also draws the attention of record companies looking for new artists to sign .
" increasingly , what you are seeing on p2p is consumer-created content , " said derek broes , from microsoft .
" they will probably play an increasing role in helping p2p spread , " he said .
looking into p2p 's future , file sharing is just the beginning for p2p networks , as far as mr broes is concerned .
" once some of these issues are resolved , you are going to see aggressive movement to protect content , but also in ways that are unimaginable now , " he said .
" file-sharing is the tip of the iceberg . "

once several high-profile legal cases against file-sharers are resolved this year , firms will be very keen to try and make money from p2p technology .
the expert panel probed the future of p2p at the consumer electronics show in las vegas earlier in january .
the first convictions for p2p piracy were handed out in the us in january .
william trowbridge and michael chicoine pleaded guilty to charges that they infringed copyright by illegally sharing music , movies and software .
since the first successful file-sharing network napster was forced to close down , the entertainment industry has been nervous and critical of p2p technology , blaming it for falling sales and piracy .
but that is going to change very soon , according to the panel .
control and cash the music and film industries have started some big legal cases against owners of legitimate p2p networks - which are not illegal in themselves - and of individuals accused of distributing pirated content over networks .
but they have slowly realised that p2p is a good way to distribute content , said travis kalanick , founder and chairman of p2p network red swoosh , and soon they are all going to want a slice of it .
they are just waiting to come up with " business models " that work for them , which includes digital rights management and copy-protection standards .

once the courts decided that the vcr in itself was not an illegal technology , the film studios turned it into an extremely lucrative business .
in august 2004 , the san francisco-based us court of appeals ruled in favour of grokster and streamcast , two file-sharing networks .
the court said they were essentially in the same position that sony was in the 1980s vcr battle , and said that the networks themselves could not be deemed as illegal .
legal too p2p networks usually do not rely on dedicated servers for the transfer of files .
instead it uses direct connections between computers - or clients .
there are now many different types of p2p systems than work in different ways .
p2p nets can be used to share any kind of file , like photos , free software , licensed music and any other digital content .
the bbc has already decided to embrace the technology .
it aims to offer most of its own programmes for download this year and it will use p2p technology to distribute them .
the files would be locked seven days after a programme aired making rights management easier to control .
but the technology is still demonised and misunderstood by many .

with violent titles continuing to top the charts , gaming and learning have not always sat well together but the tide could be beginning to turn .
recent research by the london institute of education concluded that games have a valid place in the classroom .
" games teach life skills such as decision making , problem solving , " said martin owen , at futurelab .
mr owen said games could also help children make quick assessments of situations and learning by trial and error .
speed and physics futurelab is a non-profit organisation looking at ways of using technology for innovative learning .
most game firms are too busy turning a profit in the lucrative commercial market to consider developing games for use in schools but liverpool-based games firm lateral visions saw a gap in the market .
" learning games were somewhat old-fashioned and we did n't see anyone else doing what we wanted to do , " said dr carl gavin , managing director of lateral visions .
the company set out to write something that had all the look and feel of a commercial game but with an educational and learning element .
the result is racing academy , a massively multiplayer car racing game , which requires not only a thirst for speed but a working knowledge of physics and engineering as well .

the cost of the scheme is already running at £ 35m and there is still no sign of an opening date .
the problems have included a row over peeling paint in the pools and leaks in the steam room floor .
bath and north east somerset -lrb- b & nes -rrb- council has been severely criticised over the spiralling costs , which are having to be offset by cuts elsewhere .
abbey ward councillor , dr sarah webb , fears the final bill could reach £ 40m , more than double the original estimate .
" it 's an horrific amount of money , but we ca n't pull out now , we 've poured an enormous amount of effort into this , " she said .
" we have to bite the bullet and get this thing finished . "
earlier this week , unison warned that staff may strike if the council 's commitment to the project led to job cuts within the authority .
councillor nicole o 'flaherty told the bbc : " we all want the spa to open .
it 's going to be a fantastic project when it opens and bring over £ 30m to the local economy every year - but at the moment it is an awful patch . "

the problems have included a row over peeling paint in the pools and leaks in the steam room floor .
bath and north east somerset -lrb- b & nes -rrb- council has been severely criticised over the spiralling costs , which are having to be offset by cuts elsewhere .
abbey ward councillor , dr sarah webb , fears the final bill could reach £ 40m , more than double the original estimate .
" it 's an horrific amount of money , but we ca n't pull out now , we 've poured an enormous amount of effort into this , " she said .
" we have to bite the bullet and get this thing finished . "
earlier this week , unison warned that staff may strike if the council 's commitment to the project led to job cuts within the authority .
councillor nicole o 'flaherty told the bbc : " we all want the spa to open .
it 's going to be a fantastic project when it opens and bring over £ 30m to the local economy every year - but at the moment it is an awful patch . "
