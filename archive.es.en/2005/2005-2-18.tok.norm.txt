it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ticket winners will get not just get small strips of paper .
they will come nicely packaged that now looks to be the case .
for example , in the very unusual case that a match were relocated to another stadium , the consumer could return the ticket and receive his money back , no questions asked .
secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .
müller said that in the current global situation , the prevention of attacks must remain a top goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since february 1 , 2005 , over two million fans have applied to purchase the first batch of 812,000 tickets .
these will then be awarded in a lottery in the middle of april .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .
instead , ling has been braving the below-zero temperatures in one revealing ensemble after another , proving she 's just as skilled at headline-grabbing as she is in the many uses of double-sided tape . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival set for scandal will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . -lrb- feb .

germany , on the other hand , has doled out so much public money to its orchestras that private money makes up only 13 percent of their budgets . " no one thought -lrb- innovation -rrb- was necessary , " said martin maria krüger , the president of the german music council , the world 's largest national music organization .
" there was a belief that the state would always be there to maintain cultural offerings . " bildunterschrift : trying to stay afloat krüger added that his organization would soon push for a renewed emphasis on musical education in the country 's schools to reverse the trend . sparking children 's interest in music is exactly what hermann bäumer , the musical director of the osnabrück symphonic orchestra in western germany , is already trying to do .
he has introduced youth programs that go beyond traditional school concerts .
he takes children to the city 's defunct coal mine , lets them record the sound of an old steam machine , which they use to compose their own music in collaboration with orchestra members . " it 's a way to secure our future , " he said , adding that his city-sponsored ensemble has no financial problems so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle " if you want to get kids excited about soccer , you do n't take them to a game but give them a ball instead , " he said , quoting sir simon rattle , the director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra and a strong supporter of interactive youth programs . corporate tailcoat linings but while berlin 's city government covers about half of rattle 's € 30-million -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- budget , even germany 's most famous orchestra has turned to a private sponsor to pay for its educational offerings : deutsche bank 's logo is prominently displayed on its web site . the berlin symphonic 's home page is currently under construction , but moritz would n't think twice about adding a company logo once it 's done . " you 're not doing anything bad if you 're funded by a firm , " he said , adding that he could even imagine orchestra members wearing tailcoats that are lined in the corporate color of a sponsor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the berlin symphonic orchestra tried to attract sponsors with unusual posters such as this one , which depicts a bleeding cornet .
but so far he 's still trying to find a financial savior .

it is supposed to safeguard elections in afghanistan , and keep peace in the country until 2006 .
hikmet cetin , nato representative in kabul , talked about isaf 's timetable . hikmet cetin sits in an old , two-story villa behind massive protective cement pillars .
outside , italian soldiers guard the isaf headquarters in afghanistan 's capital , kabul . as the top civil representative of nato in afghanistan , he is one of the most important actors in the central asia region today .
his job is to create peace and stability in a country that has seen neither for almost a quarter of a century .
to some an impossible task .
but to cetin , a vital one . " for our own security in the west , our main goal has to be to help afghanistan , " he said in an interview . the recent elections that confirmed prime minister hamid karzai as leader of the country have won the war-torn country international praise .
new elections , for parliamentary seats and local government positions , are due next summer .
though even politicians in kabul are doubtful they can happen so soon , cetin said delays will only slacken their reform vigor . " it is n't helpful to put off the elections any longer , " said cetin , the former turkish foreign minister .
" we have promised an election to the people of this country . " militias must be disarmed for nato , putting it off until mid-july or august - when isaf troops change command - is out of the question .
it would be too difficult to ascertain the security of the elections during such a transitional time , cetin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers after the isaf command handover ceremony in kabul in any case , international troops and the afghan government have difficult issues to deal with up to the time of the election .
for example , the disarmament of the militias that even today control large swaths of the country . " it is important to demobilize them before the parliamentary elections , in order to have free and safe elections , " cetin said .
aside from that , there are problems with the militia sub-commanders . " if we are n't careful , a kind of illegal militia could form . "
some of these sub-commanders could join parliament , according to cetin , but the rest need other inducements .
they need " jobs to make them happy , " he said . difficulty in eastern afghanistan at the same time , the isaf troops are preparing to take command of further sections of the country .
isaf already controls control the part of afghanistan that is kabul , the north , and the west of the country .
by the end of 2005 , it wants to control the south of the country , and by 2006 , everything . this means that , beginning in 2006 , even the disputed eastern part of afghanistan , with its impenetrable mountains would fall under the responsibility of the isaf .
there , on the border with pakistan , u.s. troops have been searching in vain for osama bin laden and the dispersed taliban . the mission wo n't be easy , cetin admitted .
" some countries are very hesitant in this part of the country to engage in the fight against terrorism .
but i think we can have two different missions under one command , " he said .
" the already existing coalition troops could continue the fight on terrorism , and catch osama bin laden or mullah omar and other leaders of terror organizations . " german army 's key role the nato representative said he is glad that the german army is playing an important role in the expansion of the isaf zone . " germany is playing a big part , " he said .
" right now it is very important , and supports nato with ita soldiers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.02.2005 issues facing bush on his european tour us president george bush travels to europe hoping to solidify a new spirit of cooperation with european allies .
here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .
it says the move would send the wrong signal on human rights and could tilt the military balance in the region .
the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .
the issue has come up again with a un proposal to use the icc to try suspects for crimes in sudan 's violence-wracked darfur region . - global warming : bush 's trip will come a week after the landmark kyoto protocol on global warming took effect , with the united states conspicuously on the sidelines as a non-signatory .
the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .
it says the move would send the wrong signal on human rights and could tilt the military balance in the region .
the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .
the issue has come up again with a un proposal to use the icc to try suspects for crimes in sudan 's violence-wracked darfur region . - global warming : bush 's trip will come a week after the landmark kyoto protocol on global warming took effect , with the united states conspicuously on the sidelines as a non-signatory .
the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.02.2005 reinventing a german classic 1/2 ahead faced with a drop in public funding , germany 's orchestras are exploring ways to re-establish themselves as essential cultural institutions .
at stake is the survival of one of the world 's richest classical music scenes . as the director of the berlin symphonic orchestra , andreas moritz had hoped to celebrate the orchestra 's 40th anniversary this year .
instead , he 's likely to announce the ensemble 's demise in the very near future . " if we can not find a major partner within a few weeks , the orchestra will be gone forever , " he said , adding that he 's not angry at berlin 's city government for revoking millions of euros in subsidies last year . " we 're not entitled to anything , " he said , adding that he 's not had much success in attracting private sponsors so far .
" it 's our own fault that it got to this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena -lrb- center -rrb- appeared with the berlin symphonic orchestra as the narrator in " peter and the wolf " last year .
working for next to no money , the orchestra has maintained its regular program , including school concerts with seriously reduced ticket prices .
it 's their only chance to convince potential investors of the orchestra 's qualities as a musical ambassador , moritz said . " if we do n't continue full speed ahead , if we do n't show what we can do , we 're not going to find anyone , " he said . losing public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german film orchestra counts an appearance at the academy awards among its most memorable concerts it 's a problem many of germany 's 136 professional orchestras are facing .
just recently , potsdam 's german film orchestra and the bavarian radio orchestra in munich have been threatened with closure . germany 's miserable overall economic situation has meant cuts in funding , after decades of plentiful state sponsorship .
now , ensembles across the country are waking up to the fact that they can no longer take the government 's money for granted and need to do more to attract a younger audience that has private sponsors in tow . " it 's absolutely necessary to free culture from elitism , " moritz said .
" it 's the only way to prevent further cuts in public funding . " gerald mertens , the director of the german orchestra union , agreed .
orchestras in competitive markets such as berlin , munich or the ruhrpott region in north rhine-westphalia will be particularly pressured to distinguish themselves , he said . " they have to become more active in documenting their societal value , " mertens said , adding that while germany remains the world 's no. 1 market for classical music , it lags far behind britain and especially the us in terms of innovation . please click on the second page to continue reading the story . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin orchestra goes private to survive around germany , cultural institutions are facing an uncertain future .

it is supposed to safeguard elections in afghanistan , and keep peace in the country until 2006 .
hikmet cetin , nato representative in kabul , talked about isaf 's timetable . hikmet cetin sits in an old , two-story villa behind massive protective cement pillars .
outside , italian soldiers guard the isaf headquarters in afghanistan 's capital , kabul . as the top civil representative of nato in afghanistan , he is one of the most important actors in the central asia region today .
his job is to create peace and stability in a country that has seen neither for almost a quarter of a century .
to some an impossible task .
but to cetin , a vital one . " for our own security in the west , our main goal has to be to help afghanistan , " he said in an interview . the recent elections that confirmed prime minister hamid karzai as leader of the country have won the war-torn country international praise .
new elections , for parliamentary seats and local government positions , are due next summer .
though even politicians in kabul are doubtful they can happen so soon , cetin said delays will only slacken their reform vigor . " it is n't helpful to put off the elections any longer , " said cetin , the former turkish foreign minister .
" we have promised an election to the people of this country . " militias must be disarmed for nato , putting it off until mid-july or august - when isaf troops change command - is out of the question .
it would be too difficult to ascertain the security of the elections during such a transitional time , cetin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers after the isaf command handover ceremony in kabul in any case , international troops and the afghan government have difficult issues to deal with up to the time of the election .
for example , the disarmament of the militias that even today control large swaths of the country . " it is important to demobilize them before the parliamentary elections , in order to have free and safe elections , " cetin said .
aside from that , there are problems with the militia sub-commanders . " if we are n't careful , a kind of illegal militia could form . "
some of these sub-commanders could join parliament , according to cetin , but the rest need other inducements .
they need " jobs to make them happy , " he said . difficulty in eastern afghanistan at the same time , the isaf troops are preparing to take command of further sections of the country .
isaf already controls control the part of afghanistan that is kabul , the north , and the west of the country .
by the end of 2005 , it wants to control the south of the country , and by 2006 , everything . this means that , beginning in 2006 , even the disputed eastern part of afghanistan , with its impenetrable mountains would fall under the responsibility of the isaf .
there , on the border with pakistan , u.s. troops have been searching in vain for osama bin laden and the dispersed taliban . the mission wo n't be easy , cetin admitted .
" some countries are very hesitant in this part of the country to engage in the fight against terrorism .
but i think we can have two different missions under one command , " he said .
" the already existing coalition troops could continue the fight on terrorism , and catch osama bin laden or mullah omar and other leaders of terror organizations . " german army 's key role the nato representative said he is glad that the german army is playing an important role in the expansion of the isaf zone . " germany is playing a big part , " he said .
" right now it is very important , and supports nato with ita soldiers .
and they are doing a great job here .
germany has to keep that up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included . " to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struggle over right of assembly bill parliamentary groups of the social democratic party and the green party opposed a bill to tighten the right of assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included . " to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struggle over right of assembly bill parliamentary groups of the social democratic party and the green party opposed a bill to tighten the right of assembly .

it is supposed to safeguard elections in afghanistan , and keep peace in the country until 2006 .
hikmet cetin , nato representative in kabul , talked about isaf 's timetable . hikmet cetin sits in an old , two-story villa behind massive protective cement pillars .
outside , italian soldiers guard the isaf headquarters in afghanistan 's capital , kabul . as the top civil representative of nato in afghanistan , he is one of the most important actors in the central asia region today .
his job is to create peace and stability in a country that has seen neither for almost a quarter of a century .
to some an impossible task .
but to cetin , a vital one . " for our own security in the west , our main goal has to be to help afghanistan , " he said in an interview . the recent elections that confirmed prime minister hamid karzai as leader of the country have won the war-torn country international praise .
new elections , for parliamentary seats and local government positions , are due next summer .
though even politicians in kabul are doubtful they can happen so soon , cetin said delays will only slacken their reform vigor . " it is n't helpful to put off the elections any longer , " said cetin , the former turkish foreign minister .
" we have promised an election to the people of this country . " militias must be disarmed for nato , putting it off until mid-july or august - when isaf troops change command - is out of the question .
it would be too difficult to ascertain the security of the elections during such a transitional time , cetin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers after the isaf command handover ceremony in kabul in any case , international troops and the afghan government have difficult issues to deal with up to the time of the election .
for example , the disarmament of the militias that even today control large swaths of the country . " it is important to demobilize them before the parliamentary elections , in order to have free and safe elections , " cetin said .
aside from that , there are problems with the militia sub-commanders . " if we are n't careful , a kind of illegal militia could form . "
some of these sub-commanders could join parliament , according to cetin , but the rest need other inducements .
they need " jobs to make them happy , " he said . difficulty in eastern afghanistan at the same time , the isaf troops are preparing to take command of further sections of the country .
isaf already controls control the part of afghanistan that is kabul , the north , and the west of the country .
by the end of 2005 , it wants to control the south of the country , and by 2006 , everything . this means that , beginning in 2006 , even the disputed eastern part of afghanistan , with its impenetrable mountains would fall under the responsibility of the isaf .
there , on the border with pakistan , u.s. troops have been searching in vain for osama bin laden and the dispersed taliban . the mission wo n't be easy , cetin admitted .
" some countries are very hesitant in this part of the country to engage in the fight against terrorism .
but i think we can have two different missions under one command , " he said .
" the already existing coalition troops could continue the fight on terrorism , and catch osama bin laden or mullah omar and other leaders of terror organizations . " german army 's key role the nato representative said he is glad that the german army is playing an important role in the expansion of the isaf zone . " germany is playing a big part , " he said .
" right now it is very important , and supports nato with ita soldiers .
and they are doing a great job here .
germany has to keep that up .

at stake is the survival of one of the world 's richest classical music scenes . as the director of the berlin symphonic orchestra , andreas moritz had hoped to celebrate the orchestra 's 40th anniversary this year .
instead , he 's likely to announce the ensemble 's demise in the very near future . " if we can not find a major partner within a few weeks , the orchestra will be gone forever , " he said , adding that he 's not angry at berlin 's city government for revoking millions of euros in subsidies last year . " we 're not entitled to anything , " he said , adding that he 's not had much success in attracting private sponsors so far .
" it 's our own fault that it got to this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena -lrb- center -rrb- appeared with the berlin symphonic orchestra as the narrator in " peter and the wolf " last year .
working for next to no money , the orchestra has maintained its regular program , including school concerts with seriously reduced ticket prices .
it 's their only chance to convince potential investors of the orchestra 's qualities as a musical ambassador , moritz said . " if we do n't continue full speed ahead , if we do n't show what we can do , we 're not going to find anyone , " he said . losing public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german film orchestra counts an appearance at the academy awards among its most memorable concerts it 's a problem many of germany 's 136 professional orchestras are facing .
just recently , potsdam 's german film orchestra and the bavarian radio orchestra in munich have been threatened with closure . germany 's miserable overall economic situation has meant cuts in funding , after decades of plentiful state sponsorship .
now , ensembles across the country are waking up to the fact that they can no longer take the government 's money for granted and need to do more to attract a younger audience that has private sponsors in tow . " it 's absolutely necessary to free culture from elitism , " moritz said .
" it 's the only way to prevent further cuts in public funding . " gerald mertens , the director of the german orchestra union , agreed .
orchestras in competitive markets such as berlin , munich or the ruhrpott region in north rhine-westphalia will be particularly pressured to distinguish themselves , he said . " they have to become more active in documenting their societal value , " mertens said , adding that while germany remains the world 's no. 1 market for classical music , it lags far behind britain and especially the us in terms of innovation . please click on the second page to continue reading the story . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin orchestra goes private to survive around germany , cultural institutions are facing an uncertain future .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included . " to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struggle over right of assembly bill parliamentary groups of the social democratic party and the green party opposed a bill to tighten the right of assembly .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .

it is supposed to safeguard elections in afghanistan , and keep peace in the country until 2006 .
hikmet cetin , nato representative in kabul , talked about isaf 's timetable . hikmet cetin sits in an old , two-story villa behind massive protective cement pillars .
outside , italian soldiers guard the isaf headquarters in afghanistan 's capital , kabul . as the top civil representative of nato in afghanistan , he is one of the most important actors in the central asia region today .
his job is to create peace and stability in a country that has seen neither for almost a quarter of a century .
to some an impossible task .
but to cetin , a vital one . " for our own security in the west , our main goal has to be to help afghanistan , " he said in an interview . the recent elections that confirmed prime minister hamid karzai as leader of the country have won the war-torn country international praise .
new elections , for parliamentary seats and local government positions , are due next summer .
though even politicians in kabul are doubtful they can happen so soon , cetin said delays will only slacken their reform vigor . " it is n't helpful to put off the elections any longer , " said cetin , the former turkish foreign minister .
" we have promised an election to the people of this country . " militias must be disarmed for nato , putting it off until mid-july or august - when isaf troops change command - is out of the question .
it would be too difficult to ascertain the security of the elections during such a transitional time , cetin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers after the isaf command handover ceremony in kabul in any case , international troops and the afghan government have difficult issues to deal with up to the time of the election .
for example , the disarmament of the militias that even today control large swaths of the country . " it is important to demobilize them before the parliamentary elections , in order to have free and safe elections , " cetin said .
aside from that , there are problems with the militia sub-commanders . " if we are n't careful , a kind of illegal militia could form . "
some of these sub-commanders could join parliament , according to cetin , but the rest need other inducements .
they need " jobs to make them happy , " he said . difficulty in eastern afghanistan at the same time , the isaf troops are preparing to take command of further sections of the country .
isaf already controls control the part of afghanistan that is kabul , the north , and the west of the country .
by the end of 2005 , it wants to control the south of the country , and by 2006 , everything . this means that , beginning in 2006 , even the disputed eastern part of afghanistan , with its impenetrable mountains would fall under the responsibility of the isaf .
there , on the border with pakistan , u.s. troops have been searching in vain for osama bin laden and the dispersed taliban . the mission wo n't be easy , cetin admitted .
" some countries are very hesitant in this part of the country to engage in the fight against terrorism .
but i think we can have two different missions under one command , " he said .
" the already existing coalition troops could continue the fight on terrorism , and catch osama bin laden or mullah omar and other leaders of terror organizations . " german army 's key role the nato representative said he is glad that the german army is playing an important role in the expansion of the isaf zone . " germany is playing a big part , " he said .
" right now it is very important , and supports nato with ita soldiers .
and they are doing a great job here .
germany has to keep that up .
we all agreed : if we do n't go to afghanistan , afghanistan will come to us – in the form of terror . cem sey -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opposes us plan in afghanistan at a meeting of nato defense ministers in romania on wednesday , germany objected to washington 's proposal for nato forces to take over the us military mission in afghanistan as part of next year 's reorganization efforts . -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal a bumper year for german film the best of germany 's silver screen eu boosts home-grown filmmakers culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.02.2005 berlinale shows off sexy side großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a steamy moment from taiwan 's contribution " the wayward cloud " forget the chilly temperatures - this year 's berlinale is sizzling with sex appeal , both on and off screen . at last year 's berlin film festival , the star of the winning film " head on " - sibel kekilli - created a furore when it emerged that she 'd previously acted in porn films .
this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .
instead , ling has been braving the below-zero temperatures in one revealing ensemble after another , proving she 's just as skilled at headline-grabbing as she is in the many uses of double-sided tape . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival set for scandal will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . -lrb- feb .

" our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .

the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .
proposed by prime minister tony blair 's labour government , the ban was adopted by the house of commons last november after a rarely-used law was pressed into service to override opposition in the unelected house of lords . police forces have warned that the law , which follows a similar hunting ban in scotland , could prove difficult , if not impossible , to enforce .
the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

" our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .
douglas batchelor , the chief executive for the league against cruel sports , told a press conference friday : " we have fought 80 years for this law , we will not let them flaunt it , " batchelor said . hard to police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he dismissed claims that the law can not be applied as " utter nonsense " and said " we will be watching " with tens of thousands of pounds worth of video cameras that his group has purchased .
" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .
in an interview with bbc radio , he said : " i think we are going to find that , after a few difficulties , this is going to disappear and people in a few years ' time will be wondering what on earth all the fuss is about . " ballot box effect ? on whether labour would lose votes over the ban , he said : " most people for whom hunting is their way of life and it 's the most important thing in their life wo n't vote labour , even if labour brought back slavery and witch-burning . " people could use the ballot box to register their anger , he said , adding : " however , i do n't think it will have any effect on the election at all .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ticket winners will get not just get small strips of paper .
they will come nicely packaged that now looks to be the case .
for example , in the very unusual case that a match were relocated to another stadium , the consumer could return the ticket and receive his money back , no questions asked .
secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .
müller said that in the current global situation , the prevention of attacks must remain a top goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since february 1 , 2005 , over two million fans have applied to purchase the first batch of 812,000 tickets .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal .

it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .

at stake is the survival of one of the world 's richest classical music scenes . as the director of the berlin symphonic orchestra , andreas moritz had hoped to celebrate the orchestra 's 40th anniversary this year .
instead , he 's likely to announce the ensemble 's demise in the very near future . " if we can not find a major partner within a few weeks , the orchestra will be gone forever , " he said , adding that he 's not angry at berlin 's city government for revoking millions of euros in subsidies last year . " we 're not entitled to anything , " he said , adding that he 's not had much success in attracting private sponsors so far .
" it 's our own fault that it got to this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena -lrb- center -rrb- appeared with the berlin symphonic orchestra as the narrator in " peter and the wolf " last year .
working for next to no money , the orchestra has maintained its regular program , including school concerts with seriously reduced ticket prices .

germany , on the other hand , has doled out so much public money to its orchestras that private money makes up only 13 percent of their budgets . " no one thought -lrb- innovation -rrb- was necessary , " said martin maria krüger , the president of the german music council , the world 's largest national music organization .
" there was a belief that the state would always be there to maintain cultural offerings . " bildunterschrift : trying to stay afloat krüger added that his organization would soon push for a renewed emphasis on musical education in the country 's schools to reverse the trend . sparking children 's interest in music is exactly what hermann bäumer , the musical director of the osnabrück symphonic orchestra in western germany , is already trying to do .
he has introduced youth programs that go beyond traditional school concerts .
he takes children to the city 's defunct coal mine , lets them record the sound of an old steam machine , which they use to compose their own music in collaboration with orchestra members . " it 's a way to secure our future , " he said , adding that his city-sponsored ensemble has no financial problems so far . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir simon rattle " if you want to get kids excited about soccer , you do n't take them to a game but give them a ball instead , " he said , quoting sir simon rattle , the director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra and a strong supporter of interactive youth programs . corporate tailcoat linings but while berlin 's city government covers about half of rattle 's € 30-million -lrb- $ 39 million -rrb- budget , even germany 's most famous orchestra has turned to a private sponsor to pay for its educational offerings : deutsche bank 's logo is prominently displayed on its web site . the berlin symphonic 's home page is currently under construction , but moritz would n't think twice about adding a company logo once it 's done . " you 're not doing anything bad if you 're funded by a firm , " he said , adding that he could even imagine orchestra members wearing tailcoats that are lined in the corporate color of a sponsor . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , the berlin symphonic orchestra tried to attract sponsors with unusual posters such as this one , which depicts a bleeding cornet .
but so far he 's still trying to find a financial savior .
one selling point is a prestigious award the german critics association gave to the berlin symphonic this year .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included . " to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struggle over right of assembly bill parliamentary groups of the social democratic party and the green party opposed a bill to tighten the right of assembly .

in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .

secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .
instead , ling has been braving the below-zero temperatures in one revealing ensemble after another , proving she 's just as skilled at headline-grabbing as she is in the many uses of double-sided tape . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival set for scandal will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . -lrb- feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.02.2005 clash looms over english hunt ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential pack of criminals hunt supporters and their opponents prepared for a clash of wills over a ban on using dogs to hunt foxes and other animals which took effect friday , ending a centuries-old tradition in england and wales . hunt supporters either vowed to defy the ban or said the legislation was so riddled with loopholes that it was ineffective , while their opponents vowed to help the government enforce the new ban with video camera surveillance . tim bonner , the media director for the pro-hunting countryside alliance , said he expected hundreds of thousands of hunt supporters to turn out in england and wales saturday to test what he considered to be hazy legislation . " our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .
douglas batchelor , the chief executive for the league against cruel sports , told a press conference friday : " we have fought 80 years for this law , we will not let them flaunt it , " batchelor said . hard to police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he dismissed claims that the law can not be applied as " utter nonsense " and said " we will be watching " with tens of thousands of pounds worth of video cameras that his group has purchased .
" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .
in an interview with bbc radio , he said : " i think we are going to find that , after a few difficulties , this is going to disappear and people in a few years ' time will be wondering what on earth all the fuss is about . " ballot box effect ? on whether labour would lose votes over the ban , he said : " most people for whom hunting is their way of life and it 's the most important thing in their life wo n't vote labour , even if labour brought back slavery and witch-burning . " people could use the ballot box to register their anger , he said , adding : " however , i do n't think it will have any effect on the election at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two protesters make their feelings known during a pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square , central london , wednesday sept .
15 , 2004 .
the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .
proposed by prime minister tony blair 's labour government , the ban was adopted by the house of commons last november after a rarely-used law was pressed into service to override opposition in the unelected house of lords . police forces have warned that the law , which follows a similar hunting ban in scotland , could prove difficult , if not impossible , to enforce .
the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

" our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .

" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .
in an interview with bbc radio , he said : " i think we are going to find that , after a few difficulties , this is going to disappear and people in a few years ' time will be wondering what on earth all the fuss is about . " ballot box effect ? on whether labour would lose votes over the ban , he said : " most people for whom hunting is their way of life and it 's the most important thing in their life wo n't vote labour , even if labour brought back slavery and witch-burning .

the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .
proposed by prime minister tony blair 's labour government , the ban was adopted by the house of commons last november after a rarely-used law was pressed into service to override opposition in the unelected house of lords . police forces have warned that the law , which follows a similar hunting ban in scotland , could prove difficult , if not impossible , to enforce .
the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.02.2005 issues facing bush on his european tour us president george bush travels to europe hoping to solidify a new spirit of cooperation with european allies .
here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .
it says the move would send the wrong signal on human rights and could tilt the military balance in the region .
the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .
the issue has come up again with a un proposal to use the icc to try suspects for crimes in sudan 's violence-wracked darfur region . - global warming : bush 's trip will come a week after the landmark kyoto protocol on global warming took effect , with the united states conspicuously on the sidelines as a non-signatory .
the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.02.2005 clash looms over english hunt ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential pack of criminals hunt supporters and their opponents prepared for a clash of wills over a ban on using dogs to hunt foxes and other animals which took effect friday , ending a centuries-old tradition in england and wales . hunt supporters either vowed to defy the ban or said the legislation was so riddled with loopholes that it was ineffective , while their opponents vowed to help the government enforce the new ban with video camera surveillance . tim bonner , the media director for the pro-hunting countryside alliance , said he expected hundreds of thousands of hunt supporters to turn out in england and wales saturday to test what he considered to be hazy legislation . " our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .
douglas batchelor , the chief executive for the league against cruel sports , told a press conference friday : " we have fought 80 years for this law , we will not let them flaunt it , " batchelor said . hard to police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he dismissed claims that the law can not be applied as " utter nonsense " and said " we will be watching " with tens of thousands of pounds worth of video cameras that his group has purchased .
" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .
in an interview with bbc radio , he said : " i think we are going to find that , after a few difficulties , this is going to disappear and people in a few years ' time will be wondering what on earth all the fuss is about . " ballot box effect ? on whether labour would lose votes over the ban , he said : " most people for whom hunting is their way of life and it 's the most important thing in their life wo n't vote labour , even if labour brought back slavery and witch-burning . " people could use the ballot box to register their anger , he said , adding : " however , i do n't think it will have any effect on the election at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two protesters make their feelings known during a pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square , central london , wednesday sept .
15 , 2004 .
the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .
proposed by prime minister tony blair 's labour government , the ban was adopted by the house of commons last november after a rarely-used law was pressed into service to override opposition in the unelected house of lords . police forces have warned that the law , which follows a similar hunting ban in scotland , could prove difficult , if not impossible , to enforce .
the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

" our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .

for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .

" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .

here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .
it says the move would send the wrong signal on human rights and could tilt the military balance in the region .
the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .
the issue has come up again with a un proposal to use the icc to try suspects for crimes in sudan 's violence-wracked darfur region . - global warming : bush 's trip will come a week after the landmark kyoto protocol on global warming took effect , with the united states conspicuously on the sidelines as a non-signatory .
the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .
douglas batchelor , the chief executive for the league against cruel sports , told a press conference friday : " we have fought 80 years for this law , we will not let them flaunt it , " batchelor said . hard to police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he dismissed claims that the law can not be applied as " utter nonsense " and said " we will be watching " with tens of thousands of pounds worth of video cameras that his group has purchased .
" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .
in an interview with bbc radio , he said : " i think we are going to find that , after a few difficulties , this is going to disappear and people in a few years ' time will be wondering what on earth all the fuss is about . " ballot box effect ? on whether labour would lose votes over the ban , he said : " most people for whom hunting is their way of life and it 's the most important thing in their life wo n't vote labour , even if labour brought back slavery and witch-burning . " people could use the ballot box to register their anger , he said , adding : " however , i do n't think it will have any effect on the election at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two protesters make their feelings known during a pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square , central london , wednesday sept .
15 , 2004 .
the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .
proposed by prime minister tony blair 's labour government , the ban was adopted by the house of commons last november after a rarely-used law was pressed into service to override opposition in the unelected house of lords . police forces have warned that the law , which follows a similar hunting ban in scotland , could prove difficult , if not impossible , to enforce .
the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .

secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included .

the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "

secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included . " to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struggle over right of assembly bill parliamentary groups of the social democratic party and the green party opposed a bill to tighten the right of assembly .

" we ca n't allow germany 's image in the world to be negatively influenced by this debate , " he said during a green party election campaign in kiel . fischer stressed that the controversial visa policy carried out by his ministry - which critics claim led to german embassies and consulates around the world issuing visas to " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants including prostitutes and human traffickers - was within the existing legal framework .
the issue has already claimed the scalp of his deputy ludmer vollmer . at the same time fischer suggested that even the conservative opposition has in the past shown to be in favor of less restrictive visa rules , notably under the chancellorship of helmut kohl of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the foreign minister said that even bavaria 's conservative interior minister günther beckstein was a proponent of lax visa rules " so that patients from the middle east come to bavarian clinics and not travel to the us instead . "
fischer also claimed that opposition christian social union politician hans-peter uhl , who now heads the investigative committee examining the visa scandal , had demanded less strict visa rules as did members of the cdu . dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

" we ca n't allow germany 's image in the world to be negatively influenced by this debate , " he said during a green party election campaign in kiel . fischer stressed that the controversial visa policy carried out by his ministry - which critics claim led to german embassies and consulates around the world issuing visas to " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants including prostitutes and human traffickers - was within the existing legal framework .
the issue has already claimed the scalp of his deputy ludmer vollmer . at the same time fischer suggested that even the conservative opposition has in the past shown to be in favor of less restrictive visa rules , notably under the chancellorship of helmut kohl of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the foreign minister said that even bavaria 's conservative interior minister günther beckstein was a proponent of lax visa rules " so that patients from the middle east come to bavarian clinics and not travel to the us instead . "
fischer also claimed that opposition christian social union politician hans-peter uhl , who now heads the investigative committee examining the visa scandal , had demanded less strict visa rules as did members of the cdu . dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .
germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included . " to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struggle over right of assembly bill parliamentary groups of the social democratic party and the green party opposed a bill to tighten the right of assembly .

it is supposed to safeguard elections in afghanistan , and keep peace in the country until 2006 .
hikmet cetin , nato representative in kabul , talked about isaf 's timetable . hikmet cetin sits in an old , two-story villa behind massive protective cement pillars .
outside , italian soldiers guard the isaf headquarters in afghanistan 's capital , kabul . as the top civil representative of nato in afghanistan , he is one of the most important actors in the central asia region today .
his job is to create peace and stability in a country that has seen neither for almost a quarter of a century .
to some an impossible task .
but to cetin , a vital one . " for our own security in the west , our main goal has to be to help afghanistan , " he said in an interview . the recent elections that confirmed prime minister hamid karzai as leader of the country have won the war-torn country international praise .
new elections , for parliamentary seats and local government positions , are due next summer .
though even politicians in kabul are doubtful they can happen so soon , cetin said delays will only slacken their reform vigor . " it is n't helpful to put off the elections any longer , " said cetin , the former turkish foreign minister .
" we have promised an election to the people of this country . " militias must be disarmed for nato , putting it off until mid-july or august - when isaf troops change command - is out of the question .
it would be too difficult to ascertain the security of the elections during such a transitional time , cetin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers after the isaf command handover ceremony in kabul in any case , international troops and the afghan government have difficult issues to deal with up to the time of the election .
for example , the disarmament of the militias that even today control large swaths of the country . " it is important to demobilize them before the parliamentary elections , in order to have free and safe elections , " cetin said .

it is supposed to safeguard elections in afghanistan , and keep peace in the country until 2006 .
hikmet cetin , nato representative in kabul , talked about isaf 's timetable . hikmet cetin sits in an old , two-story villa behind massive protective cement pillars .
outside , italian soldiers guard the isaf headquarters in afghanistan 's capital , kabul . as the top civil representative of nato in afghanistan , he is one of the most important actors in the central asia region today .
his job is to create peace and stability in a country that has seen neither for almost a quarter of a century .
to some an impossible task .
but to cetin , a vital one . " for our own security in the west , our main goal has to be to help afghanistan , " he said in an interview . the recent elections that confirmed prime minister hamid karzai as leader of the country have won the war-torn country international praise .
new elections , for parliamentary seats and local government positions , are due next summer .
though even politicians in kabul are doubtful they can happen so soon , cetin said delays will only slacken their reform vigor . " it is n't helpful to put off the elections any longer , " said cetin , the former turkish foreign minister .
" we have promised an election to the people of this country . " militias must be disarmed for nato , putting it off until mid-july or august - when isaf troops change command - is out of the question .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal .

it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "

here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .
it says the move would send the wrong signal on human rights and could tilt the military balance in the region .
the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .
the issue has come up again with a un proposal to use the icc to try suspects for crimes in sudan 's violence-wracked darfur region . - global warming : bush 's trip will come a week after the landmark kyoto protocol on global warming took effect , with the united states conspicuously on the sidelines as a non-signatory .
the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.02.2005 clash looms over english hunt ban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a potential pack of criminals hunt supporters and their opponents prepared for a clash of wills over a ban on using dogs to hunt foxes and other animals which took effect friday , ending a centuries-old tradition in england and wales . hunt supporters either vowed to defy the ban or said the legislation was so riddled with loopholes that it was ineffective , while their opponents vowed to help the government enforce the new ban with video camera surveillance . tim bonner , the media director for the pro-hunting countryside alliance , said he expected hundreds of thousands of hunt supporters to turn out in england and wales saturday to test what he considered to be hazy legislation . " our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .
douglas batchelor , the chief executive for the league against cruel sports , told a press conference friday : " we have fought 80 years for this law , we will not let them flaunt it , " batchelor said . hard to police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he dismissed claims that the law can not be applied as " utter nonsense " and said " we will be watching " with tens of thousands of pounds worth of video cameras that his group has purchased .
" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .
in an interview with bbc radio , he said : " i think we are going to find that , after a few difficulties , this is going to disappear and people in a few years ' time will be wondering what on earth all the fuss is about . " ballot box effect ? on whether labour would lose votes over the ban , he said : " most people for whom hunting is their way of life and it 's the most important thing in their life wo n't vote labour , even if labour brought back slavery and witch-burning . " people could use the ballot box to register their anger , he said , adding : " however , i do n't think it will have any effect on the election at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two protesters make their feelings known during a pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square , central london , wednesday sept .
15 , 2004 .
the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .
proposed by prime minister tony blair 's labour government , the ban was adopted by the house of commons last november after a rarely-used law was pressed into service to override opposition in the unelected house of lords . police forces have warned that the law , which follows a similar hunting ban in scotland , could prove difficult , if not impossible , to enforce .
the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ticket winners will get not just get small strips of paper .
they will come nicely packaged that now looks to be the case .
for example , in the very unusual case that a match were relocated to another stadium , the consumer could return the ticket and receive his money back , no questions asked .
secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .
müller said that in the current global situation , the prevention of attacks must remain a top goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since february 1 , 2005 , over two million fans have applied to purchase the first batch of 812,000 tickets .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .

secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.02.2005 issues facing bush on his european tour us president george bush travels to europe hoping to solidify a new spirit of cooperation with european allies .
here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .

nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included .

here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .

the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .
it says the move would send the wrong signal on human rights and could tilt the military balance in the region .
the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .
the issue has come up again with a un proposal to use the icc to try suspects for crimes in sudan 's violence-wracked darfur region . - global warming : bush 's trip will come a week after the landmark kyoto protocol on global warming took effect , with the united states conspicuously on the sidelines as a non-signatory .
the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included . " to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de struggle over right of assembly bill parliamentary groups of the social democratic party and the green party opposed a bill to tighten the right of assembly .

here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .
it says the move would send the wrong signal on human rights and could tilt the military balance in the region .
the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .
the issue has come up again with a un proposal to use the icc to try suspects for crimes in sudan 's violence-wracked darfur region . - global warming : bush 's trip will come a week after the landmark kyoto protocol on global warming took effect , with the united states conspicuously on the sidelines as a non-signatory .
the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.02.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc fischer targets opposition in visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday warned that the ongoing heated debate over his role in a damning illegal immigration affair could affect germany 's international standing . " we ca n't allow germany 's image in the world to be negatively influenced by this debate , " he said during a green party election campaign in kiel . fischer stressed that the controversial visa policy carried out by his ministry - which critics claim led to german embassies and consulates around the world issuing visas to " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants including prostitutes and human traffickers - was within the existing legal framework .
the issue has already claimed the scalp of his deputy ludmer vollmer . at the same time fischer suggested that even the conservative opposition has in the past shown to be in favor of less restrictive visa rules , notably under the chancellorship of helmut kohl of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the foreign minister said that even bavaria 's conservative interior minister günther beckstein was a proponent of lax visa rules " so that patients from the middle east come to bavarian clinics and not travel to the us instead . "
fischer also claimed that opposition christian social union politician hans-peter uhl , who now heads the investigative committee examining the visa scandal , had demanded less strict visa rules as did members of the cdu . dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .

" we ca n't allow germany 's image in the world to be negatively influenced by this debate , " he said during a green party election campaign in kiel . fischer stressed that the controversial visa policy carried out by his ministry - which critics claim led to german embassies and consulates around the world issuing visas to " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants including prostitutes and human traffickers - was within the existing legal framework .
the issue has already claimed the scalp of his deputy ludmer vollmer . at the same time fischer suggested that even the conservative opposition has in the past shown to be in favor of less restrictive visa rules , notably under the chancellorship of helmut kohl of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the foreign minister said that even bavaria 's conservative interior minister günther beckstein was a proponent of lax visa rules " so that patients from the middle east come to bavarian clinics and not travel to the us instead . "
fischer also claimed that opposition christian social union politician hans-peter uhl , who now heads the investigative committee examining the visa scandal , had demanded less strict visa rules as did members of the cdu . dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .

hikmet cetin , nato representative in kabul , talked about isaf 's timetable . hikmet cetin sits in an old , two-story villa behind massive protective cement pillars .
outside , italian soldiers guard the isaf headquarters in afghanistan 's capital , kabul . as the top civil representative of nato in afghanistan , he is one of the most important actors in the central asia region today .
his job is to create peace and stability in a country that has seen neither for almost a quarter of a century .
to some an impossible task .
but to cetin , a vital one . " for our own security in the west , our main goal has to be to help afghanistan , " he said in an interview . the recent elections that confirmed prime minister hamid karzai as leader of the country have won the war-torn country international praise .
new elections , for parliamentary seats and local government positions , are due next summer .
though even politicians in kabul are doubtful they can happen so soon , cetin said delays will only slacken their reform vigor . " it is n't helpful to put off the elections any longer , " said cetin , the former turkish foreign minister .
" we have promised an election to the people of this country . " militias must be disarmed for nato , putting it off until mid-july or august - when isaf troops change command - is out of the question .
it would be too difficult to ascertain the security of the elections during such a transitional time , cetin said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soldiers after the isaf command handover ceremony in kabul in any case , international troops and the afghan government have difficult issues to deal with up to the time of the election .
for example , the disarmament of the militias that even today control large swaths of the country . " it is important to demobilize them before the parliamentary elections , in order to have free and safe elections , " cetin said .
aside from that , there are problems with the militia sub-commanders . " if we are n't careful , a kind of illegal militia could form . "
some of these sub-commanders could join parliament , according to cetin , but the rest need other inducements .
they need " jobs to make them happy , " he said . difficulty in eastern afghanistan at the same time , the isaf troops are preparing to take command of further sections of the country .
isaf already controls control the part of afghanistan that is kabul , the north , and the west of the country .
by the end of 2005 , it wants to control the south of the country , and by 2006 , everything . this means that , beginning in 2006 , even the disputed eastern part of afghanistan , with its impenetrable mountains would fall under the responsibility of the isaf .
there , on the border with pakistan , u.s. troops have been searching in vain for osama bin laden and the dispersed taliban . the mission wo n't be easy , cetin admitted .
" some countries are very hesitant in this part of the country to engage in the fight against terrorism .
but i think we can have two different missions under one command , " he said .
" the already existing coalition troops could continue the fight on terrorism , and catch osama bin laden or mullah omar and other leaders of terror organizations . " german army 's key role the nato representative said he is glad that the german army is playing an important role in the expansion of the isaf zone . " germany is playing a big part , " he said .
" right now it is very important , and supports nato with ita soldiers .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .

the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .

" we ca n't allow germany 's image in the world to be negatively influenced by this debate , " he said during a green party election campaign in kiel . fischer stressed that the controversial visa policy carried out by his ministry - which critics claim led to german embassies and consulates around the world issuing visas to " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants including prostitutes and human traffickers - was within the existing legal framework .
the issue has already claimed the scalp of his deputy ludmer vollmer . at the same time fischer suggested that even the conservative opposition has in the past shown to be in favor of less restrictive visa rules , notably under the chancellorship of helmut kohl of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the foreign minister said that even bavaria 's conservative interior minister günther beckstein was a proponent of lax visa rules " so that patients from the middle east come to bavarian clinics and not travel to the us instead . "
fischer also claimed that opposition christian social union politician hans-peter uhl , who now heads the investigative committee examining the visa scandal , had demanded less strict visa rules as did members of the cdu . dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "

for example , in the very unusual case that a match were relocated to another stadium , the consumer could return the ticket and receive his money back , no questions asked .
secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .
müller said that in the current global situation , the prevention of attacks must remain a top goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 18.02.2005 agreement paves way for smoother ticket sale großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans lucky enough to get tickets will be able to transfer them to friends a row over world cup 2006 tickets between officials and a consumer rights group worried about privacy protection has been resolved after the group won concessions from german organizers .
it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ticket winners will get not just get small strips of paper .
they will come nicely packaged that now looks to be the case .
for example , in the very unusual case that a match were relocated to another stadium , the consumer could return the ticket and receive his money back , no questions asked .
secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .
müller said that in the current global situation , the prevention of attacks must remain a top goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since february 1 , 2005 , over two million fans have applied to purchase the first batch of 812,000 tickets .
these will then be awarded in a lottery in the middle of april .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "

for example , in the very unusual case that a match were relocated to another stadium , the consumer could return the ticket and receive his money back , no questions asked .
secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .
müller said that in the current global situation , the prevention of attacks must remain a top goal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.02.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc fischer targets opposition in visa scandal german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday warned that the ongoing heated debate over his role in a damning illegal immigration affair could affect germany 's international standing . " we ca n't allow germany 's image in the world to be negatively influenced by this debate , " he said during a green party election campaign in kiel . fischer stressed that the controversial visa policy carried out by his ministry - which critics claim led to german embassies and consulates around the world issuing visas to " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants including prostitutes and human traffickers - was within the existing legal framework .
the issue has already claimed the scalp of his deputy ludmer vollmer . at the same time fischer suggested that even the conservative opposition has in the past shown to be in favor of less restrictive visa rules , notably under the chancellorship of helmut kohl of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the foreign minister said that even bavaria 's conservative interior minister günther beckstein was a proponent of lax visa rules " so that patients from the middle east come to bavarian clinics and not travel to the us instead . "
fischer also claimed that opposition christian social union politician hans-peter uhl , who now heads the investigative committee examining the visa scandal , had demanded less strict visa rules as did members of the cdu . dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .
germany 's most popular politician is facing stiff criticism for his responsibility in an illegal immigration affair .
his fate depends on the outcome of a raging political war .

the 12-month rate of inflation was therefore substantially slower than the 2.1 percent recorded in december .
according to the statisticians , the main reason for the slowdown was an increase in consumer prices in january 2004 due to healthcare reforms , an effect which was absent in january this year .
on the other hand , oil prices continued to fuel inflation , with the price of light heating oil surging by 20.5 percent on a 12-month basis .
excluding oil prices , cpi would have risen by 1.4 percent year-on-year last month , the office said .

" we ca n't allow germany 's image in the world to be negatively influenced by this debate , " he said during a green party election campaign in kiel . fischer stressed that the controversial visa policy carried out by his ministry - which critics claim led to german embassies and consulates around the world issuing visas to " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants including prostitutes and human traffickers - was within the existing legal framework .
the issue has already claimed the scalp of his deputy ludmer vollmer . at the same time fischer suggested that even the conservative opposition has in the past shown to be in favor of less restrictive visa rules , notably under the chancellorship of helmut kohl of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the foreign minister said that even bavaria 's conservative interior minister günther beckstein was a proponent of lax visa rules " so that patients from the middle east come to bavarian clinics and not travel to the us instead . "
fischer also claimed that opposition christian social union politician hans-peter uhl , who now heads the investigative committee examining the visa scandal , had demanded less strict visa rules as did members of the cdu . dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .

at stake is the survival of one of the world 's richest classical music scenes . as the director of the berlin symphonic orchestra , andreas moritz had hoped to celebrate the orchestra 's 40th anniversary this year .
instead , he 's likely to announce the ensemble 's demise in the very near future . " if we can not find a major partner within a few weeks , the orchestra will be gone forever , " he said , adding that he 's not angry at berlin 's city government for revoking millions of euros in subsidies last year . " we 're not entitled to anything , " he said , adding that he 's not had much success in attracting private sponsors so far .

at stake is the survival of one of the world 's richest classical music scenes . as the director of the berlin symphonic orchestra , andreas moritz had hoped to celebrate the orchestra 's 40th anniversary this year .
instead , he 's likely to announce the ensemble 's demise in the very near future . " if we can not find a major partner within a few weeks , the orchestra will be gone forever , " he said , adding that he 's not angry at berlin 's city government for revoking millions of euros in subsidies last year . " we 're not entitled to anything , " he said , adding that he 's not had much success in attracting private sponsors so far .
" it 's our own fault that it got to this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena -lrb- center -rrb- appeared with the berlin symphonic orchestra as the narrator in " peter and the wolf " last year .
working for next to no money , the orchestra has maintained its regular program , including school concerts with seriously reduced ticket prices .
it 's their only chance to convince potential investors of the orchestra 's qualities as a musical ambassador , moritz said . " if we do n't continue full speed ahead , if we do n't show what we can do , we 're not going to find anyone , " he said . losing public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german film orchestra counts an appearance at the academy awards among its most memorable concerts it 's a problem many of germany 's 136 professional orchestras are facing .
just recently , potsdam 's german film orchestra and the bavarian radio orchestra in munich have been threatened with closure . germany 's miserable overall economic situation has meant cuts in funding , after decades of plentiful state sponsorship .
now , ensembles across the country are waking up to the fact that they can no longer take the government 's money for granted and need to do more to attract a younger audience that has private sponsors in tow . " it 's absolutely necessary to free culture from elitism , " moritz said .
" it 's the only way to prevent further cuts in public funding . " gerald mertens , the director of the german orchestra union , agreed .
orchestras in competitive markets such as berlin , munich or the ruhrpott region in north rhine-westphalia will be particularly pressured to distinguish themselves , he said . " they have to become more active in documenting their societal value , " mertens said , adding that while germany remains the world 's no. 1 market for classical music , it lags far behind britain and especially the us in terms of innovation . please click on the second page to continue reading the story . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin orchestra goes private to survive around germany , cultural institutions are facing an uncertain future .

as the upper house or the bundesrat2 started debate on the historic eu treaty , foreign minister joschka fischer called on the assembly to send a " positive signal " to europe by finishing its work before the summer recess .
the treaty , which is aimed at streamlining the eu 's institutions and decision-making processes with 25 member states , must be ratified in germany by both houses of parliament with a two-thirds majority vote . according to german press reports , the government has arranged with france to conclude the process by june to give the treaty a psychological boost just as the french prepare to vote on it in a referendum .
germany is among roughly half of the eu 's member states which have chosen to submit the text to parliament for ratification , rather than in a referendum . dw-world.de eu parliament approves constitution the european parliament has sent an important signal of unity by overwhelmingly endorsing the eu 's proposed new constitution .
now , it is up to the bloc 's 25 member states to ratify the historic treaty .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .
instead , ling has been braving the below-zero temperatures in one revealing ensemble after another , proving she 's just as skilled at headline-grabbing as she is in the many uses of double-sided tape . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival set for scandal will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . -lrb- feb .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .

the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .

at stake is the survival of one of the world 's richest classical music scenes . as the director of the berlin symphonic orchestra , andreas moritz had hoped to celebrate the orchestra 's 40th anniversary this year .
instead , he 's likely to announce the ensemble 's demise in the very near future . " if we can not find a major partner within a few weeks , the orchestra will be gone forever , " he said , adding that he 's not angry at berlin 's city government for revoking millions of euros in subsidies last year . " we 're not entitled to anything , " he said , adding that he 's not had much success in attracting private sponsors so far .
" it 's our own fault that it got to this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena -lrb- center -rrb- appeared with the berlin symphonic orchestra as the narrator in " peter and the wolf " last year .
working for next to no money , the orchestra has maintained its regular program , including school concerts with seriously reduced ticket prices .
it 's their only chance to convince potential investors of the orchestra 's qualities as a musical ambassador , moritz said . " if we do n't continue full speed ahead , if we do n't show what we can do , we 're not going to find anyone , " he said . losing public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german film orchestra counts an appearance at the academy awards among its most memorable concerts it 's a problem many of germany 's 136 professional orchestras are facing .
just recently , potsdam 's german film orchestra and the bavarian radio orchestra in munich have been threatened with closure . germany 's miserable overall economic situation has meant cuts in funding , after decades of plentiful state sponsorship .
now , ensembles across the country are waking up to the fact that they can no longer take the government 's money for granted and need to do more to attract a younger audience that has private sponsors in tow . " it 's absolutely necessary to free culture from elitism , " moritz said .
" it 's the only way to prevent further cuts in public funding . " gerald mertens , the director of the german orchestra union , agreed .
orchestras in competitive markets such as berlin , munich or the ruhrpott region in north rhine-westphalia will be particularly pressured to distinguish themselves , he said . " they have to become more active in documenting their societal value , " mertens said , adding that while germany remains the world 's no. 1 market for classical music , it lags far behind britain and especially the us in terms of innovation . please click on the second page to continue reading the story . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin orchestra goes private to survive around germany , cultural institutions are facing an uncertain future .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal .

it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included .

" our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .
douglas batchelor , the chief executive for the league against cruel sports , told a press conference friday : " we have fought 80 years for this law , we will not let them flaunt it , " batchelor said . hard to police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he dismissed claims that the law can not be applied as " utter nonsense " and said " we will be watching " with tens of thousands of pounds worth of video cameras that his group has purchased .
" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .
in an interview with bbc radio , he said : " i think we are going to find that , after a few difficulties , this is going to disappear and people in a few years ' time will be wondering what on earth all the fuss is about . " ballot box effect ? on whether labour would lose votes over the ban , he said : " most people for whom hunting is their way of life and it 's the most important thing in their life wo n't vote labour , even if labour brought back slavery and witch-burning . " people could use the ballot box to register their anger , he said , adding : " however , i do n't think it will have any effect on the election at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two protesters make their feelings known during a pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square , central london , wednesday sept .
15 , 2004 .
the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .
proposed by prime minister tony blair 's labour government , the ban was adopted by the house of commons last november after a rarely-used law was pressed into service to override opposition in the unelected house of lords . police forces have warned that the law , which follows a similar hunting ban in scotland , could prove difficult , if not impossible , to enforce .
the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .

" we ca n't allow germany 's image in the world to be negatively influenced by this debate , " he said during a green party election campaign in kiel . fischer stressed that the controversial visa policy carried out by his ministry - which critics claim led to german embassies and consulates around the world issuing visas to " hundreds of thousands " of illegal immigrants including prostitutes and human traffickers - was within the existing legal framework .
the issue has already claimed the scalp of his deputy ludmer vollmer . at the same time fischer suggested that even the conservative opposition has in the past shown to be in favor of less restrictive visa rules , notably under the chancellorship of helmut kohl of the christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- . the foreign minister said that even bavaria 's conservative interior minister günther beckstein was a proponent of lax visa rules " so that patients from the middle east come to bavarian clinics and not travel to the us instead . "
fischer also claimed that opposition christian social union politician hans-peter uhl , who now heads the investigative committee examining the visa scandal , had demanded less strict visa rules as did members of the cdu . dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : berlinale 2005 berlin film festival set for scandal a bumper year for german film the best of germany 's silver screen eu boosts home-grown filmmakers culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.02.2005 berlinale shows off sexy side großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a steamy moment from taiwan 's contribution " the wayward cloud " forget the chilly temperatures - this year 's berlinale is sizzling with sex appeal , both on and off screen . at last year 's berlin film festival , the star of the winning film " head on " - sibel kekilli - created a furore when it emerged that she 'd previously acted in porn films .
this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .
instead , ling has been braving the below-zero temperatures in one revealing ensemble after another , proving she 's just as skilled at headline-grabbing as she is in the many uses of double-sided tape . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival set for scandal will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . -lrb- feb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.02.2005 issues facing bush on his european tour us president george bush travels to europe hoping to solidify a new spirit of cooperation with european allies .
here is a rundown of the trip 's major issues . - iraq : armed with the success of iraq 's january 30 national elections , bush is seeking to overcome any lingering resentment over the us-led invasion and enlist allied help to rebuild the country .
washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .
it says the move would send the wrong signal on human rights and could tilt the military balance in the region .
the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .
the issue has come up again with a un proposal to use the icc to try suspects for crimes in sudan 's violence-wracked darfur region . - global warming : bush 's trip will come a week after the landmark kyoto protocol on global warming took effect , with the united states conspicuously on the sidelines as a non-signatory .
the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .
the us leader will also have a chance to see ukraine 's new president , viktor yushchenko , in brussels to celebrate his victory over electoral fraud and a moscow-backed opponent . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .
instead , ling has been braving the below-zero temperatures in one revealing ensemble after another , proving she 's just as skilled at headline-grabbing as she is in the many uses of double-sided tape . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin film festival set for scandal will smith and keanu reeves are expected to lend the 55th berlin film festival star quality , organizers said , while sex as science and titillation is set to be one of the event 's outstanding themes . -lrb- feb .

this year , the festival got straight to the point , making sex - and porn - one of its main themes .
" sex sells , " said festival director , dieter kosslick .
and this year , there 's so much of it on offer that one local tabloid dubbed the festival the " sexinale . "
a round-up of the sexiest moments at the berlinale : the films bildunterschrift : " deep throat " made porn mainstream much of what 's getting everyone hot and bothered at the berlinale is happening on the big screen .
one of the most anticipated films was " inside deep throat , " a documentary about the making of one of the most commercially successful films ever , the 1972 us film " deep throat . "
the film 's late-night screening was completely sold out , and was accompanied by more than the usual amount of pushing and shoving when the doors opened . the porn theme continues with german director jochen hick 's " cycles of porn - sex / life in la part 2 , " which tracks a group of young gay actors hoping for stardom in the porn industry , and also examines how the internet has taken over the sex business . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " that man : peter berlin " another film in a special panorama section entitled " sex and gender " is " that man : peter berlin , " which looks at the self-made success of the eponymous 1970s gay porn icon . competing for the golden bear is " tian bian yi duo yun -lrb- the wayward cloud -rrb- " a taiwanese film about a romance between a woman and a man who is pursuing a career as porn actor .
its many explicit sex scenes caused nervous tittering during the screening , which most will remember for the moment in which a watermelon loses its innocence . also in competition is " kinsey , " in which liam neeson plays the pioneering and controversial american sex researcher , alfred c. kinsey . the events off-screen , french director catherine breillat - notorious for sex scenes that critics say border on pornography - gave a seminar on " ways of directing intimacy for the screen " for the young filmmakers attending the festival 's talent campus .
the title of breillat 's seminar , " directing sex , " was provocative enough to ensure a packed-out venue . the pop star sexy singer george michael , who 's often raised the ire of conservative groups with suggestive songs such as " freeek ! " and " i want your sex " stopped by the berlinale to introduce a new documentary about his life .
" a different story " is a candid look at the singer 's career , his sexuality , and the various ups and downs that accompanied record releases as well as long periods of silence .
" i thought i should explain myself before i disappear , " michael said . the jury bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jury member bai ling when it comes to sex appeal , one jury member has definitely stolen the show .
although chinese actress bai ling claims to have brought a pant suit with her to berlin , it has yet to emerge on the red carpet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included .

but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .

it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ticket winners will get not just get small strips of paper .
they will come nicely packaged that now looks to be the case .
for example , in the very unusual case that a match were relocated to another stadium , the consumer could return the ticket and receive his money back , no questions asked .
secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .
müller said that in the current global situation , the prevention of attacks must remain a top goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since february 1 , 2005 , over two million fans have applied to purchase the first batch of 812,000 tickets .
these will then be awarded in a lottery in the middle of april .

it 's good news for soccer fans . the big-spending consumer , alias the soccer fan , won a small victory thursday when the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- agreed to alter application forms for the already hot-selling tickets to the world cup 2006 in germany .
the change means that wide-ranging personal data from applicants - requested by organizers for security reasons - can be exempted from commercial use at their request .
in return , the federation of german consumer organizations -lrb- vzbv -rrb- , which was worried that the original application forms would amount to an unncessary invasion of privacy , has said it will not take the dfb to court to win such changes .
at the same time , the world cup organizational committee announced that those who win tickets through the lottery would be allowed to transfer tickets to friends and relatives - under certain conditions .
in addition , a market will be set up where fans can trade tickets .
finally , individual data and rights of spectators will be better protected .
consumer rights ' groups satisfied it took direct talks between leaders of the dfb and german consumer advocates before any agreement could be reached .
dfb president theo zwanziger met with vzbv executive director edda müller in berlin , this meeting coming after the consumer rights group had sent two letters of complaint to the dfb .
müller said the vzbv was " very satisfied " with the agreement .
zwanziger , also vice president on the organizational committee , concurred : " the interests of the soccer fans as consumers must take priority . "

secondly , the transfer of a ticket is theoretically possible .
it can not be refused except for security reasons , putting the fears of some people to rest that they would have to get a note from their doctor in order to pass on the ticket to someone else .
nevertheless , the organizational committee still has the final say in case of a transfer , a point that committee press speaker jens grittner underlined .
" of course we are acting in the interest of the fans and spectators , " but the transfer of tickets can only be an exception .
on the online application form , it will be clearly stated that fans can order their tickets without any worry that their personal data will be used for commercial purposes .
one piece of information continues to be mandatory when ordering - personal identification or passport numbers .

" our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .
douglas batchelor , the chief executive for the league against cruel sports , told a press conference friday : " we have fought 80 years for this law , we will not let them flaunt it , " batchelor said . hard to police bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he dismissed claims that the law can not be applied as " utter nonsense " and said " we will be watching " with tens of thousands of pounds worth of video cameras that his group has purchased .
" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .
in an interview with bbc radio , he said : " i think we are going to find that , after a few difficulties , this is going to disappear and people in a few years ' time will be wondering what on earth all the fuss is about . " ballot box effect ? on whether labour would lose votes over the ban , he said : " most people for whom hunting is their way of life and it 's the most important thing in their life wo n't vote labour , even if labour brought back slavery and witch-burning . " people could use the ballot box to register their anger , he said , adding : " however , i do n't think it will have any effect on the election at all . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two protesters make their feelings known during a pro-hunting demonstration in parliament square , central london , wednesday sept .
15 , 2004 .
the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .
proposed by prime minister tony blair 's labour government , the ban was adopted by the house of commons last november after a rarely-used law was pressed into service to override opposition in the unelected house of lords . police forces have warned that the law , which follows a similar hunting ban in scotland , could prove difficult , if not impossible , to enforce .
the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

" our advice is to test the law and not to break it , " bonner said .
" there are huge grey areas in it .
for instance , if several people have two hounds and are in the same area , then the two hounds become four hounds , and become six hounds and become eight hounds . " bildunterschrift : i 'm outta here ! " the law says that if you lay a scent of a dead fox and the hounds then run off and hunt a live fox , which they are quite likely to do , and kill it , then you wo n't be breaking the law because you intended to hunt an artificial trail , " he said . he was referring to " drag " or " trail " hunting , in which hunters will still be allowed to attract hounds by trailing a dead fox or a bag of straw scented with fox urine .
" this has absolutely nothing to do with protecting foxes .
more foxes will be killed as a result of this law . " other hunt supporters said they would violate the law anyway since it would be impossible for police to follow them over large stretches of countryside .

" hunters should be aware that we have the capacity to monitor every hunt in the country , " he said , adding , " lawbreakers will be prosecuted . " not only will league members monitor hunts , " we will be recording conversations in pubs .
if they are talking about ways of breaking the law , this is criminal conspiracy . " leading anti-hunt labour lawmaker tony banks said he was aware the legislation would be tested by hunt supporters , but predicted most people would comply with the ban .

the hunting act , which took effect at midnight , was the result of years of campaigning by those who regard hunting with hounds - a part of british country life for centuries - as cruel and inhumane .

the ban most notably affects fox hunting , in which red-jacketed riders on horseback gallop after foxhounds which trail a fox and , if they are successful , will catch it , kill it and rip it apart . lesser known , but also to be prohibited , is hare coursing , a spectator sport in which a pair of greyhounds are set loose after a hare which often , but not always , gets away . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de britain bans fox hunting britain 's parliament has forced through a ban on fox hunting , leaving prime minister tony blair facing the prospect of massive civil disobedience from hunters in the run-up to an imminent general election .

washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .

washington hopes all 26 nato members will contribute one way or another to the training of iraqi security forces , providing political cover if not substantive support for the operation . - middle east : with prospects for israeli-palestinian peace looking brighter , both europeans and americans see the process as a key test of transatlantic cooperation .
bush , who announced a $ 350-million aid package to help develop palestinian institutions , is looking to his allies to make their own contributions and pressure arab states to follow suit . - syria-lebanon : the assassination of former lebanese prime minister rafiq hariri has sparked a round of franco-american cooperation in efforts to force syria to pull out of lebanon .
bush will also be scouting support to pressure damascus to end its backing for insurgents in iraq and islamic militants seeking to wreck the middle east peace process . - iran : the united states and the europeans have been struggling to stay on the same page in efforts to halt iran 's suspected nuclear weapons program .
the americans are impatient over the slow progress of european-led negotiations and want un sanctions .
the allies say they need more direct us diplomatic support - and less veiled threats of military action . - china : washington is unhappy at the prospects that the european union will lift an arms embargo on china imposed after the massacre of pro-democracy students in 1989 .

the eu could adopt a code of conduct for sales to appease the americans . - international criminal court : the europeans are irked over the us refusal to back the icc set up in the hague to try war crimes suspects .
the americans fear it could be used for politically motivated prosecution of us diplomats and soldiers .

the president 's rejection of the pact to curb the emission of greenhouse gases is a major source of his unpopularity in europe . - russia : bush will meet with his russian counterpart vladimir putin in slovakia to discuss the war on terror and other issues , and likely chide him on moscow 's slow move towards democracy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.02.2005 seeking common ground to curb neo-nazis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german legislators are trying to prevent pictures like this on may 8 both the government and opposition agree that the right of assembly needs tightening to prevent neo-nazi marches at historic landmarks such as the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but details still need to be ironed out . after a day of political wrangling and heated discussions in the parliament on friday , german politicians came a step closer to approving a draft proposal drawn up by the ruling social democrat-green party coalition on limiting the german right of assembly in order to prevent neo-nazi demonstrations near sensitive national landmarks . the debate comes at a time when germany is under pressure to rein in its increasingly emboldened right-wing extremists .
large neo-nazi demonstrations last week in dresden during the 60th anniversary of the allied bombing of the city and further planned far-right marches at the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin on may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii , have turned up the heat on policy makers . the domestic policy experts for the two major parties , the governing social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- and the opposition christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said they would meet next week to try and come up with a bipartisan proposal . " why should n't we manage to do that for the sake of democracy ? " the spd 's dieter wüfelspütz told passauer neue presse newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's holocaust memorial consists of 2,751 concrete pillars and will be opened on may 10 .
it 's just down the street from the brandenburg gate his counterpart , wolfgang bosbach , told the same daily friday that the most important thing was to protect national landmarks - the brandenburg gate and the holocaust memorial in berlin - against abuse by neo-nazis . keeping neo-nazis away earlier , a draft to control assembly rights proposed by interior minister otto schily had been under heavy fire from all sides .
it intends to keep right-wing extremists , especially the national democratic party -lrb- npd -rrb- , from demonstrating near important state and national sites . social democrat and green party coalition members have expressed fear that schily ’ s draft may be unconstitutional and have come up with their own proposal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's brandenburg gate has become a national symbol .
it stands just a stone 's throw away from parliament but just how far the law should go is still a matter of dispute .
cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it . " but the draft law drafted by schily and justice minister brigitte zypries has been criticized from within the ranks of the governing coalition as well . protecting national symbols bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's reichstag houses the german parliament the draft law proposes an additional paragraph in the german assembly law , which would ratify a list of symbolic sites drawn up by the german parliament .
but critics warn that the politicians must be careful not to overstep the constitutional right to the freedom of expression , on the one hand , or to create loopholes for right-wing extremists . a passage calling for up to three years in jail for glorification of the nazis or downplaying the atrocities of the third reich has been cut from the bill that will be presented to parliament on friday .
suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included . " to think of right-wing extremist groups demonstrating in front of memorials for the victims of nazi crimes , either endorsing , denying , or playing down these crimes against humanity , is unbearable , " schily said . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : struggle over right of assembly bill parliamentary groups of the social democratic party and the green party opposed a bill to tighten the right of assembly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 18.02.2005 reinventing a german classic 1/2 ahead faced with a drop in public funding , germany 's orchestras are exploring ways to re-establish themselves as essential cultural institutions .
at stake is the survival of one of the world 's richest classical music scenes . as the director of the berlin symphonic orchestra , andreas moritz had hoped to celebrate the orchestra 's 40th anniversary this year .
instead , he 's likely to announce the ensemble 's demise in the very near future . " if we can not find a major partner within a few weeks , the orchestra will be gone forever , " he said , adding that he 's not angry at berlin 's city government for revoking millions of euros in subsidies last year . " we 're not entitled to anything , " he said , adding that he 's not had much success in attracting private sponsors so far .
" it 's our own fault that it got to this point . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german pop singer nena -lrb- center -rrb- appeared with the berlin symphonic orchestra as the narrator in " peter and the wolf " last year .
working for next to no money , the orchestra has maintained its regular program , including school concerts with seriously reduced ticket prices .
it 's their only chance to convince potential investors of the orchestra 's qualities as a musical ambassador , moritz said . " if we do n't continue full speed ahead , if we do n't show what we can do , we 're not going to find anyone , " he said . losing public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german film orchestra counts an appearance at the academy awards among its most memorable concerts it 's a problem many of germany 's 136 professional orchestras are facing .
just recently , potsdam 's german film orchestra and the bavarian radio orchestra in munich have been threatened with closure . germany 's miserable overall economic situation has meant cuts in funding , after decades of plentiful state sponsorship .
now , ensembles across the country are waking up to the fact that they can no longer take the government 's money for granted and need to do more to attract a younger audience that has private sponsors in tow . " it 's absolutely necessary to free culture from elitism , " moritz said .
" it 's the only way to prevent further cuts in public funding . " gerald mertens , the director of the german orchestra union , agreed .
orchestras in competitive markets such as berlin , munich or the ruhrpott region in north rhine-westphalia will be particularly pressured to distinguish themselves , he said . " they have to become more active in documenting their societal value , " mertens said , adding that while germany remains the world 's no. 1 market for classical music , it lags far behind britain and especially the us in terms of innovation . please click on the second page to continue reading the story . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin orchestra goes private to survive around germany , cultural institutions are facing an uncertain future .

cdu members have suggested extending the no-demonstration zone around the parliament to the brandenburg gate to keep " undesirables " away . sticking to the constitution but the spd 's wiefelspütz said this is unlikely to happen as the parliament is only allowed to limit the right to demonstrate near its buildings in order to guarantee the legislature 's orderly conduct of business . " in my opinion , this proposal is obviously unconstitutional , " he said .
" the law has unconstitutionality written all over it .
i am convinced of it .

suggestions to prohibit demonstrations at sites of national symbolic nature , such as the holocaust memorial , will be included .

the border crossing point at aflao is one of the busiest in west africa .
traders , hawkers and loiterers shuffle across the boundary , as if the two countries were one village .
ghana 's volta region was once part of togoland , until the people there voted in a plebiscite to join ghana at independence 47 years ago .
so the ewes on either side of their common border are , indeed , one people .
and many togolese keep one foot on either side of the border , living in ghana by night and working in the markets of the capital , lome , by day .

being a proud coward , i joined the traffic of shuffling feet back across the border to aflao .
afraid there i met koshi , who sells used clothes at a market in lome .

togo : africa 's test case " now i can not go to market , i can not sell because i 'm worried and afraid . "
another man said he had no more freedom with eyadema dead than he did when he was alive .
" eyadema died , but we 're not free , because of his children , " he said .
" the day that we heard eyadema died , we were happy . "
but catherine nutakor , who goes to togo to sell plastic bowls , says she 's not worried by the events of the last 10 days .
" it 's not affected my business or anybody in togo .
but i did n't open my shop on the day of the general strike , i stayed at home . "
ms nutakor is ghanaian , and maybe that makes it easier for her to have a more relaxed attitude .
shared music indeed , it was difficult to find any togolese people at aflao who were prepared to speak kindly of eyadema and the takeover by his son , faure .
with all the anxiety in togo when ghana is at its most stable , i wondered if the togolese sometimes wished that the rest of their country had joined their cousins in the volta region and become part of ghana back in 1956 ?
" no , i do n't like it so .
let ghana be ghana and togo be togo , " koshi said adamantly .
for koshi , having a hospitable place to run to , where there is a shared history and a common culture , and where the music after sunset is n't alien , is good enough .

south korean-based samsung closed its factory at wynyard , near billingham , in april 2004 with the loss of 400 jobs .
the site was bought by local firm wynyard limited , which has promised 1,000 jobs with a new business park .
now the company has announced a deal to develop 50,000ft of office units on the redeveloped site .
the scheme is in addition to the development announced in november 2004 , which revealed plans for private investment of £ 35m and the potential for 1,000 jobs , subject to planning permission on 38 acres of the 200-acre site .
chris musgrave , managing director of wynyard ltd , said : " we want to create a sustainable business community here at wynyard , accommodating both large and small companies .
" the units have been created to meet current demand and are also an attractive option for companies to offer employees the chance to acquire property within pension schemes . "
darlington-based niven architects have been appointed by wynyard ltd to create the contemporary scheme .
an application by wynyard ltd to relax the existing planning consent to allow non-electronics companies to occupy the site is currently being considered by the local authority .

the children 's commissioner for wales peter clarke agreed and said that the move by the uk government could undermine the rights of young people .
under current law , it is possible to name children issued with an asbo .

asbos were introduced by the government to stamp out unruly and anti-social behaviour , and particularly have been used to target young people .

the serious and organised crime and police bill , which is going before the house of commons , will make it legal to name children appearing in court for breaking an asbo .
speaking to bbc radio 4 's law in action programme , mr clarke said the bill chipped away at the rights of young people .
" i 'm concerned about this .
it 's chipping away at the rights of young people and asbos are being used disproportionately against young people , " he said .
" if someone does breach an order , the behaviour may not be illegal but , by breaching an asbo , this will lead to a criminal offence .

a child who is accused of murder wo n't be named until they 're convicted .
" so in some ways this is putting a disproportionate degree of notoriety on the child because of what may be a very small bit of anti-social behaviour . "
barnardo 's has warned this could be the " slippery slope " to the naming of all children in all criminal trials .
the home office said in a statement : " publicity is a key factor in the effectiveness of asbos .
" whilst local communities can currently identify those who are subject to an asbo , they are not informed of the outcome when the individual commits the more serious offence of breaching that asbo .
" lifting reporting restrictions on breaches should not only act as a deterrent factor but will also maintain public confidence in the effectiveness of the system . "

plans to allow the naming of children who breach anti-social behaviour orders -lrb- asbo -rrb- have been criticised by children 's charity barnardo 's .
the children 's commissioner for wales peter clarke agreed and said that the move by the uk government could undermine the rights of young people .
under current law , it is possible to name children issued with an asbo .
but it is usually against the law to identify them if they breach the order and appear in a criminal court .
barnardo 's said the plans could lead to children in other criminal cases being named .
asbos were introduced by the government to stamp out unruly and anti-social behaviour , and particularly have been used to target young people .
they are usually imposed by local authorities in a civil court .
children over the age of 10 who are the subject of an order are usually named under civil law .
asbos are being used disproportionately against young people , peter clarke if they break the order , they commit a criminal offence , however - and it is normally against the law to identify children who appear in court on criminal charges .
the serious and organised crime and police bill , which is going before the house of commons , will make it legal to name children appearing in court for breaking an asbo .
speaking to bbc radio 4 's law in action programme , mr clarke said the bill chipped away at the rights of young people .
" i 'm concerned about this .
it 's chipping away at the rights of young people and asbos are being used disproportionately against young people , " he said .
peter clarke says children are ' disproportionately ' given asbos " if someone does breach an order , the behaviour may not be illegal but , by breaching an asbo , this will lead to a criminal offence .
" and now they will be named .
a child who is accused of murder wo n't be named until they 're convicted .
" so in some ways this is putting a disproportionate degree of notoriety on the child because of what may be a very small bit of anti-social behaviour . "
barnardo 's has warned this could be the " slippery slope " to the naming of all children in all criminal trials .
the home office said in a statement : " publicity is a key factor in the effectiveness of asbos .
" whilst local communities can currently identify those who are subject to an asbo , they are not informed of the outcome when the individual commits the more serious offence of breaching that asbo .
" lifting reporting restrictions on breaches should not only act as a deterrent factor but will also maintain public confidence in the effectiveness of the system . "
