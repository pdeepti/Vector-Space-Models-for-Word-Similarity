now , the country 's social democrats are churning up the party 's past . it 's often said of austria that it has not done enough to come to terms with its nazi past .
the country became part of the third reich when it was annexed by hitler in 1938 .
it 's often described as hitler 's first victim , despite the fact that many austrians welcomed the nazis and held prominent positions in hitler 's regime .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : populistic austrian politician jörg haider has been frequently criticized for pro-nazi remarks this has n't gone unnoticed in the alpine country .
an old inside joke among austrians is to compare politicians to " punschkrapfen " - sweet cakes which are iced pink -lrb- left wing -rrb- on the outside , but are chocolate brown -lrb- the color of the nazis -rrb- on the inside .
austria 's social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- , arguably the most powerful political movement in the country during the post-war period , has served up its fair share punschkrapfen - members with a nazi past who took up powerful positions in the fledgling democracy after 1945 .
historian maria mesner has just completed her report on austria 's post-war period , and it does n't paint a pretty picture of the socialists .
red is not always red in the study , she revealed that just over 10 percent of the socialists ' parliamentarians and senior officers in the immediate post-war years had once been members of the nazi party.this was a time when austria was occupied by the victorious allied powers and memories of nazi atrocities were fresh .
" in the beginning , the social democratic party really tried to keep former nazis out of the party , or remove them , " mesner said .
but political pragmatism quickly replaced the distaste for those who 'd been part of the totalitarian regime .
when it came time for elections in late 1945 , votes became more important than grappling with the recent past , mesner said .
" it became clear that the first elections would be held already in autumn 1945 and all the political parties started to compete for voters , " the historian said .
" the number of people related to or connected to nazis was a rather big part of the electorate . " 2005 : an important year the year 2005 marks an important year for austria .
not only does it mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation from nazi germany , but 50 years ago , austria regained its sovereignty from the allies after a decade of occupation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austrian president heinz fischer but the opportunity to talk openly about the country 's collective memory with regard to nazi germany has been avoided to a great extent .
austria 's president , heinz fischer , a former social democrat who 's been active in left wing politics for nearly 40 years , admitted to austria 's reluctance to talk about the past .
" it took quite a long time until we found the right language for some problems , " the 66-year-old graz native said .
" the national fund for victims of the nazi era was n't established until 1995 ... so you can say it was very late .
some say it was too late . "
high ground no longer possible the revelations about the social democrats , who have been in power in austria either in coalition or ruling in their own right for most of the past 50 years , struck a blow to the party .
in the past , they 've generally taken the moral high ground when it comes to denouncing former nazis and the far right , but according to mesner , the left wing of politics has gone along with the rest in repressing the past .
" when a large share of a population is involved in a regime like that , as was the case with the third reich , then how things are talked about becomes an important issue .
and they were not talked about , " she said .
" people were rewarded , so to say , if they did n't talk about it . "

gross was a successful forensic scientist during the nazi regime , because he dissected the brains of hundreds of children killed under the nazis ' euthanasia program at a vienna clinic .
he was linked to the deaths of nine children , but was able to remain a party member until 1981 .
" there were several cases like this , " said mesner .
" this was the most prominent one and the most disturbing one .
i think it was a commitment by elites not to discuss it . "
the heinrich gross affair provided the incentive for the social democrats to begin the airing of their dirty laundry .
but if brown stains have been found on austria 's reds they 're sure to turn up on other political colors , too .

now , the country 's social democrats are churning up the party 's past . it 's often said of austria that it has not done enough to come to terms with its nazi past .
the country became part of the third reich when it was annexed by hitler in 1938 .

austria 's social democratic party -lrb- spö -rrb- , arguably the most powerful political movement in the country during the post-war period , has served up its fair share punschkrapfen - members with a nazi past who took up powerful positions in the fledgling democracy after 1945 .

austria 's president , heinz fischer , a former social democrat who 's been active in left wing politics for nearly 40 years , admitted to austria 's reluctance to talk about the past .

last week 's london bombings have sent politicians scrambling to step up security .
but , the only way europe can defend itself against terrorism is by being honest and adopting a smarter foreign policy . eu politicians meeting in brussels this week once again had a taste of their own powerlessness - it seems there is no protection from fanatic suicide bombers . it does n't matter how many surveillance cameras and phone taps later supply crucial data that can help to track down the perpetrators - unfortunately they do n't help to prevent attacks by self-appointed jehadis . what can the eu do ?
what can we do ? integration has failed western societies can be honest to themselves and admit that their approach to integration until now has failed .
that 's because the london bombers were british citizens and from all we know so far , integrated into british society .
yet , they wanted to destroy that very same society . the muslim environment that the young men grew up in either did n't recognize the warning signs of an increasing radicalization or they did n't alert the authorities to it . the only thing that remains to be done is step up surveillance .
should spies and undercover agents infiltrate muslim minorities as demanded by günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister ? after all , it seems that tolerance towards extreme islamic views was n't a good idea : great britain and even spain were for decades breeding grounds for hate-preachers who could , under the cloak of liberal freedom of expression , incite people to wage war against the non-believers . caving in to terrorist demands ? representatives of the muslim community in britain believe the deeper reasons behind the terror lie in the ongoing palestinian conflict , the war against the taliban and the conflict in iraq . if one were to give in to that argument , then europe would have to more clearly side with the palestinians , withdraw its troops from afghanistan and iraq and condemn us policy in the middle east to protect itself from terrorist attacks in the long term . that may help but it is politically unrealistic . it would be a victory for the terrorists , who unfortunately have already achieved much through their tactics .
their attacks have n't just claimed 54 lives in london so far , but they 're also forcing europe and the us to invest unbelievable amounts of personnel , political energy and money in the fight against terror . a smarter foreign policy europe ca n't seal itself off from immigrants , it ca n't isolate muslim minorities and it also ca n't protect itself against radical suicide bombers with walls , the way israel is attempting to . what remains is a long , arduous and risk-riddled way : we need a smarter foreign policy that would lead to an end to the middle east conflict . moderate , muslim nations have to be supported in building their economies in order to offer a perspective to the rapidly swelling number of unemployed youth . the us and europeans who invaded iraq must be honest about the fact that the country has become a recruiting bazaar for future terrorist generations .
that has to be stopped .
preventive wars , that only make everything worse , should not be waged anymore . on the other hand , there 's a need for immense efforts to find the masterminds of terror in afghanistan and iraq , the bin ladens and zarkawis , and to dispose them . many people in europe are at a loss as to how to go on and how to balance freedom and the right to defend oneself .
we 've fallen into the terror trap . bernd riegert -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bomb probe widens to egypt , pakistan britain 's probe into last week 's london bombings took on a new twist friday with the arrest of an egyptian chemistry expert in cairo and a " pakistan connection " to the attacks .
-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : living with growing suspicion following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not .
-lrb- july 15 , 2005 -rrb- eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

last week 's london bombings have sent politicians scrambling to step up security .
but , the only way europe can defend itself against terrorism is by being honest and adopting a smarter foreign policy . eu politicians meeting in brussels this week once again had a taste of their own powerlessness - it seems there is no protection from fanatic suicide bombers . it does n't matter how many surveillance cameras and phone taps later supply crucial data that can help to track down the perpetrators - unfortunately they do n't help to prevent attacks by self-appointed jehadis . what can the eu do ?
what can we do ? integration has failed western societies can be honest to themselves and admit that their approach to integration until now has failed .
that 's because the london bombers were british citizens and from all we know so far , integrated into british society .
yet , they wanted to destroy that very same society . the muslim environment that the young men grew up in either did n't recognize the warning signs of an increasing radicalization or they did n't alert the authorities to it . the only thing that remains to be done is step up surveillance .
should spies and undercover agents infiltrate muslim minorities as demanded by günther beckstein , bavarian interior minister ? after all , it seems that tolerance towards extreme islamic views was n't a good idea : great britain and even spain were for decades breeding grounds for hate-preachers who could , under the cloak of liberal freedom of expression , incite people to wage war against the non-believers . caving in to terrorist demands ? representatives of the muslim community in britain believe the deeper reasons behind the terror lie in the ongoing palestinian conflict , the war against the taliban and the conflict in iraq . if one were to give in to that argument , then europe would have to more clearly side with the palestinians , withdraw its troops from afghanistan and iraq and condemn us policy in the middle east to protect itself from terrorist attacks in the long term . that may help but it is politically unrealistic . it would be a victory for the terrorists , who unfortunately have already achieved much through their tactics .
their attacks have n't just claimed 54 lives in london so far , but they 're also forcing europe and the us to invest unbelievable amounts of personnel , political energy and money in the fight against terror . a smarter foreign policy europe ca n't seal itself off from immigrants , it ca n't isolate muslim minorities and it also ca n't protect itself against radical suicide bombers with walls , the way israel is attempting to . what remains is a long , arduous and risk-riddled way : we need a smarter foreign policy that would lead to an end to the middle east conflict . moderate , muslim nations have to be supported in building their economies in order to offer a perspective to the rapidly swelling number of unemployed youth . the us and europeans who invaded iraq must be honest about the fact that the country has become a recruiting bazaar for future terrorist generations .
that has to be stopped .
preventive wars , that only make everything worse , should not be waged anymore . on the other hand , there 's a need for immense efforts to find the masterminds of terror in afghanistan and iraq , the bin ladens and zarkawis , and to dispose them . many people in europe are at a loss as to how to go on and how to balance freedom and the right to defend oneself .

but she said she would stop short of sending german soldiers to iraq to support us forces . " we would not have done that and we will not do that , " merkel said . schröder 's strident rhetoric against the us-led invasion of iraq is widely credited with helping his social democrats narrowly win the 2002 general election against the opposition christian union parties -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german troops train iraqi security forces in the united arab emirates since then , the chancellor has repeatedly ruled out deploying german troops in iraq .
germany has opted instead to train iraqi security forces in the united arab emirates . but merkel , whose cdu / csu alliance has a lead in opinion polls , said a government under her leadership would " put europe 's relations with the united states on a proper footing again . " defending tax hikes merkel also defended her proposal for a two-point hike in the country 's 16 percent value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- , which has emerged as a hot button issue in the run-up to possible early elections in september .
she told the berliner zeitung that the tax hike would cut labor costs , boost economic growth and create jobs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel plans to raise vat in germany " by raising vat by two percentage points we 'll be able to quickly cut the supplemental wage costs by two points , " merkel said .
" you ca n't look at only the increase .
looking at the whole picture you can see clearly why we 're doing it . " the head of the bdi german industry federation , ludolf von wartenberg , added his voice to that of other critics of the plan , including merkel 's allies in the liberal free democrat party , who warned it would negatively impact spending and growth . " why do they have to start off by raising the vat ? " von wartenberg asked .
" cutting spending should take priority .
there are huge potential savings to be found by reforming the social welfare system . " social democrat party leader franz müntefering said his party would keep up pressure on the conservative 's vat proposals . " it 's a job killer , " he told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
" the talk of raising vat is horribly damaging to the economy . " battered by a string of state poll losses , schröder called for a fresh mandate for his reform agenda .
he deliberately lost a no-confidence vote before parliament earlier this month with the aim of triggering an early election in september . president horst köhler has until july 22 to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call a national poll . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel critical of schröder 's un strategy angela merkel , germany 's conservative leader , took a swipe at chancellor gerhard schröder for his position on un security council reform .

a us state department spokesman has described gen zhu 's remarks as " unfortunate " and " irresponsible " .
china regards taiwan as a renegade province .
one-china commitment the chinese general , who is not directly involved in china 's military strategy , made his remarks to foreign reporters on friday .
" if the americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition onto the target zone on china 's territory , i think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons , " maj gen zhu told an official briefing for foreign reporters . "
we firmly believe it is in the interests of both china and the united states ... to oppose the ' taiwan independence " ' chinese foreign ministry the general said his comments were " my assessment , not the policy of the government " .
he said he was confident the us and china would not go to war .
the us is currently taiwan 's biggest arms supplier and has indicated it would defend the island in the event of a chinese invasion .
gen zhu 's remarks come at a time when many us politicians are already concerned about china 's military build-up .
state department spokesman sean mccormack said he hoped they did not reflect chinese official policy .
on saturday , the chinese foreign ministry said : " we will firmly abide by the principles of peaceful re-unification and one country two systems and we will express the deepest sincerity and exert the greatest efforts to realise peaceful reunification .
" we will never tolerate the ' taiwan independence ' , " the spokesman said .
he said china appreciated the us government 's repeated commitments to the one-china policy .
" we hope the united states will fulfil its commitments with concrete actions and join efforts with china to maintain the peace and stability across the taiwan strait , " he said .

guy fawkes was born in york in 1570 .
at 200ft -lrb- 61m -rrb- in diameter , the maze 's clock face alone is nearly 10 times the size of the real thing .
the maze is on the a1079 , off the a64 , and opens to the public on saturday .
covering 24 acres , it is being considered for the title of the world 's largest temporary crop maze by the guinness book of world records .
it claims to beat the current record holder by seven acres .
visitors will be able to find their way around the maze by answering clues from a series of giant talking sculptures .
the maze will close in september so the crop can be harvested to feed the cows .

but only in northern ireland will we think first of the blast bombs of ardoyne and not the much more deadly ones of london and the revelation that young suicide bombers delivered them .
as if to confirm our place in the second division of the new world -lrb- dis -rrb- order , the scenes from north belfast barely made the national television news .
the angry young men of ardoyne were no match for the angry young men from west yorkshire responsible for the carnage in the underground and the number 30 bus in tavistock square .
violence erupted in ardoyne on 12 july not even the use of blast bombs and plastic baton rounds in north belfast and the discovery of a roadside bomb in armagh will change that .
the effect within the bubble of northern ireland politics , however , could be a very different thing .
on one hand the claim that dissident republicans were behind the violence - and that senior sinn fein figures appeared to be doing what they could to prevent trouble - will ease the fears of some .
but not those with whom sinn fein will have to deal if there is ever to be a political settlement .
one senior dup source said : " the problem is if the provos were n't responsible for what happened then what use are they in terms of the overall situation .
" and if they were involved and are hiding behind this cloak then what does that say about their commitment to exclusively peaceful means . "
' peacefully parading ' dup mp gregory campbell made it clear on radio ulster 's inside politics programme that the events in ardoyne will make it even more difficult to reach a deal .
he said : ' ' let 's say the -lrb- ira -rrb- statement comes , and let 's say there is the usual media rush to try to proclaim this as a tremendous move by them , and we await a testing period of time to establish that they have gone out of business .
" and let 's assume that over the winter things are much quieter than they presently are .
" does anybody seriously think that in a period of time coming up to june and july of next year , if we go through all of this and republican elements are throwing more blast bombs at orange marchers who are peacefully parading ; that petrol bombs are flying in londonderry or elsewhere ; people are just going to say well the ira have gone away and really this is just some sort of non-descript event that occurred and it 's a blip - do n't worry about it .
that 's ludicrous .
therefore the lesson of this conversation has to be that what worked in derry or elsewhere is when people sit down and talk to each other all of our problems can be satisfactorily addressed alex maskey sinn fein ' ' there will be very serious repercussions for political discussions whenever - if ever - they take place , whether its this winter or next winter and we have to solve this parading issue as part of the overall settlement . "
sinn fein 's alex maskey told the same programme : ' ' when gregory talks about having to sort out the issue of parading , he 's absolutely 100 % right and hits the nail on the head .
" because all of these matters still have to be resolved regardless of what the ira may or may not say in the time ahead .
' ' therefore the lesson of this conversation has to be that what worked in derry or elsewhere is when people sit down and talk to each other all of our problems can be satisfactorily addressed . "
' pointless exercise ' the dup leader ian paisley also appeared to up the ante in his twelfth speech in portglenone .
he said : " there must be a complete disbandoning -lrb- sic -rrb- of the ira lock , stock and barrel .
and i want to see that arsenal of blood weapons destroyed and i want you to see it and we demand it must be transparent .
" we are not looking for one photograph .
we are looking for every photograph we can get , to see that it is done and done forever . "
that was not available last december - how likely is it now ?
ian paisley said " arsenal of blood weapons " must be destroyed the guessing game about an ira statement appears to be an increasingly pointless exercise .
first it would come in june .
it did n't .
then it would probably come by the middle of july after the marching season climaxed .
not so far it has n't .
some think it may be september , when minds usually turn to negotiations so as to turn the heat up on the dup at a time of maximum advantage .
that might be right too -lrb- though the dup seem fairly well insulated -rrb- but the truth is no-one outside a fairly select bunch of republican leaders know and they are not giving much away .
there are other questions thrown up by the continuing problems surrounding the twelfth on ardoyne .
given sinn fein claims that the psni overreacted to the violence of ardoyne , how would a similar situation be handled if and when the party finally signs up to policing .
soon newspaper adverts will invite applications from people wishing to become members of a new parades commission whose period in office begins in december .
the present chairman , tony holland , is understood to have indicated he does not wish to stand again , as have some other commission members .
whoever replaces them will face the same old headaches .
more and more it appears an answer will not be found to the problem of politics without an answer being found to the problem of parades .

but only in northern ireland will we think first of the blast bombs of ardoyne and not the much more deadly ones of london and the revelation that young suicide bombers delivered them .
as if to confirm our place in the second division of the new world -lrb- dis -rrb- order , the scenes from north belfast barely made the national television news .
the angry young men of ardoyne were no match for the angry young men from west yorkshire responsible for the carnage in the underground and the number 30 bus in tavistock square .
violence erupted in ardoyne on 12 july not even the use of blast bombs and plastic baton rounds in north belfast and the discovery of a roadside bomb in armagh will change that .
the effect within the bubble of northern ireland politics , however , could be a very different thing .
on one hand the claim that dissident republicans were behind the violence - and that senior sinn fein figures appeared to be doing what they could to prevent trouble - will ease the fears of some .
but not those with whom sinn fein will have to deal if there is ever to be a political settlement .
one senior dup source said : " the problem is if the provos were n't responsible for what happened then what use are they in terms of the overall situation .
" and if they were involved and are hiding behind this cloak then what does that say about their commitment to exclusively peaceful means . "
' peacefully parading ' dup mp gregory campbell made it clear on radio ulster 's inside politics programme that the events in ardoyne will make it even more difficult to reach a deal .
he said : ' ' let 's say the -lrb- ira -rrb- statement comes , and let 's say there is the usual media rush to try to proclaim this as a tremendous move by them , and we await a testing period of time to establish that they have gone out of business .
" and let 's assume that over the winter things are much quieter than they presently are .
" does anybody seriously think that in a period of time coming up to june and july of next year , if we go through all of this and republican elements are throwing more blast bombs at orange marchers who are peacefully parading ; that petrol bombs are flying in londonderry or elsewhere ; people are just going to say well the ira have gone away and really this is just some sort of non-descript event that occurred and it 's a blip - do n't worry about it .
that 's ludicrous .
therefore the lesson of this conversation has to be that what worked in derry or elsewhere is when people sit down and talk to each other all of our problems can be satisfactorily addressed alex maskey sinn fein ' ' there will be very serious repercussions for political discussions whenever - if ever - they take place , whether its this winter or next winter and we have to solve this parading issue as part of the overall settlement . "
sinn fein 's alex maskey told the same programme : ' ' when gregory talks about having to sort out the issue of parading , he 's absolutely 100 % right and hits the nail on the head .
" because all of these matters still have to be resolved regardless of what the ira may or may not say in the time ahead .
' ' therefore the lesson of this conversation has to be that what worked in derry or elsewhere is when people sit down and talk to each other all of our problems can be satisfactorily addressed . "
' pointless exercise ' the dup leader ian paisley also appeared to up the ante in his twelfth speech in portglenone .
he said : " there must be a complete disbandoning -lrb- sic -rrb- of the ira lock , stock and barrel .
and i want to see that arsenal of blood weapons destroyed and i want you to see it and we demand it must be transparent .
" we are not looking for one photograph .
we are looking for every photograph we can get , to see that it is done and done forever . "
that was not available last december - how likely is it now ?
ian paisley said " arsenal of blood weapons " must be destroyed the guessing game about an ira statement appears to be an increasingly pointless exercise .
first it would come in june .
it did n't .
then it would probably come by the middle of july after the marching season climaxed .
not so far it has n't .
some think it may be september , when minds usually turn to negotiations so as to turn the heat up on the dup at a time of maximum advantage .
that might be right too -lrb- though the dup seem fairly well insulated -rrb- but the truth is no-one outside a fairly select bunch of republican leaders know and they are not giving much away .
there are other questions thrown up by the continuing problems surrounding the twelfth on ardoyne .
given sinn fein claims that the psni overreacted to the violence of ardoyne , how would a similar situation be handled if and when the party finally signs up to policing .
soon newspaper adverts will invite applications from people wishing to become members of a new parades commission whose period in office begins in december .
the present chairman , tony holland , is understood to have indicated he does not wish to stand again , as have some other commission members .
whoever replaces them will face the same old headaches .
more and more it appears an answer will not be found to the problem of politics without an answer being found to the problem of parades .

they would have to engage better with minorities - but the minorities would have to take the first step , he said .
an air of radicalism had been building up among a minority of muslims , mr ghaffur added .

" our thoughts are with all the bereaved families and we have to live ourselves with the loss of our son in these difficult circumstances .
