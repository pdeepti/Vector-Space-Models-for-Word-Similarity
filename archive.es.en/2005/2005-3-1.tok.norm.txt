program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2005 flat tax revolution puts europe on edge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax reform will attract more investors like volkswagen slovakia in bratislava last week , george w. bush praised slovakia 's new flat tax .
but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders . at the moment , the euro valley industrial park half an hour outside of bratislava is not much more than a name . subcontractors to nearby volkswagen slovakia and other car companies inhabit some of the nondescript buildings , but much of the park is uninhabited or undeveloped .
euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .
the country , which has already attracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has produced more than a million cars in bratislava german giants like volkswagen and siemens , looks forward to posing more problems for western european governments looking to stop the flow of companies moving eastwards . in addition to already cheaper labor , countries like ukraine , romania and slovakia have offered up the flat tax as an additional incentive for foreign companies . “ it definitely puts pressure on western europe , ” said kevin waddell , an eastern europe-based analyst with the boston consulting group . the giants respond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy european economic giants france and germany have already voiced their disapproval .
then french finance minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said that if the new member states could “ afford ” a flat tax - which traditionally leads to a decline in tax revenues - they wouldn ’ t need financial help from the european union .
chancellor gerhard schröder last year also criticized the new member states for taking aid from brussels while stealing business from western europe . “ it is certainly unreasonable that we finance an unbridled tax competition among each other via the budget of the european union , " schröder said last may . germany , by comparison , has an average corporate tax of 38 percent , a rate that economists consider one of the big reasons foreign companies are bypassing the former european giant .
but schröder shows no sign of budging . resistance to change in germany when germany ’ s council of economic advisors last summer recommended the government introduce a flat tax of 30 percent , their proposal was duly ignored . “ most politicians don ’ t think they can convince the population of the need for a unified tax rate , ” said wolfgang wiegard -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the economic council .
“ the reason is the concern in germany that the redistributive role of the tax system would be reduced . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wiegard , head of the economic advisors ' council like sweden , italy and france , germany has a massive social net to support .
a flat tax would mean taxing the rich at the same rate as the working class .
more importantly , it would mean less tax revenues flowing into the government coffers and less money to pay for unemployment insurance , pensions , education and so on . west should learn from east rather than adjust their tax rates too drastically , france and germany are at the moment trying to push the eu into introducing a unified corporate tax rate .
the strategy puzzles many in eastern europe . “ why should we be punished for the flat tax ? ” said jozef uhrlik , ceo of volkswagen slovakia , after a panel discussion in bratislava last week .
he then launched into a criticism of the union ’ s “ irrational ” labor policy , “ unrealistic ” environmental policy and massive agricultural budget . “ we have implemented something that is rational , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava , slovakia 's capital drafted and passed by the slovak parliament at an astonishing speed in 2003 , the tax is being treated warily by some in slovakia .
as part of the reform , lower taxes on certain foodstuffs and products that had meant spending relief for the working class were eliminated .
opposition politicians are concerned about the long-term consequences for those who don ’ t earn much , as slovakia angles for foreign companies . “ i ’ m not sure it ’ s fair to those people , ” said pavol pesca , an opposition parliamentarian from the poor eastern city of kosice .
“ maybe it ’ s fair in a more developed country with a bigger middle class . ” but that ’ s exactly what slovakia ’ s flat tax advocates argue will emerge in the central european country .
the tax reform , they say , will reward the middle class for earning and producing more , provided the investment keeps flowing in . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slovaks reject populist in presidential election voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .
since then he 's been present at numerous neo-nazi gatherings and events worldwide . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .
the country , which has already attracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has produced more than a million cars in bratislava german giants like volkswagen and siemens , looks forward to posing more problems for western european governments looking to stop the flow of companies moving eastwards . in addition to already cheaper labor , countries like ukraine , romania and slovakia have offered up the flat tax as an additional incentive for foreign companies . “ it definitely puts pressure on western europe , ” said kevin waddell , an eastern europe-based analyst with the boston consulting group . the giants respond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy european economic giants france and germany have already voiced their disapproval .
then french finance minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said that if the new member states could “ afford ” a flat tax - which traditionally leads to a decline in tax revenues - they wouldn ’ t need financial help from the european union .
chancellor gerhard schröder last year also criticized the new member states for taking aid from brussels while stealing business from western europe . “ it is certainly unreasonable that we finance an unbridled tax competition among each other via the budget of the european union , " schröder said last may . germany , by comparison , has an average corporate tax of 38 percent , a rate that economists consider one of the big reasons foreign companies are bypassing the former european giant .
but schröder shows no sign of budging . resistance to change in germany when germany ’ s council of economic advisors last summer recommended the government introduce a flat tax of 30 percent , their proposal was duly ignored . “ most politicians don ’ t think they can convince the population of the need for a unified tax rate , ” said wolfgang wiegard -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the economic council .
“ the reason is the concern in germany that the redistributive role of the tax system would be reduced . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wiegard , head of the economic advisors ' council like sweden , italy and france , germany has a massive social net to support .
a flat tax would mean taxing the rich at the same rate as the working class .
more importantly , it would mean less tax revenues flowing into the government coffers and less money to pay for unemployment insurance , pensions , education and so on . west should learn from east rather than adjust their tax rates too drastically , france and germany are at the moment trying to push the eu into introducing a unified corporate tax rate .
the strategy puzzles many in eastern europe . “ why should we be punished for the flat tax ? ” said jozef uhrlik , ceo of volkswagen slovakia , after a panel discussion in bratislava last week .
he then launched into a criticism of the union ’ s “ irrational ” labor policy , “ unrealistic ” environmental policy and massive agricultural budget . “ we have implemented something that is rational , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava , slovakia 's capital drafted and passed by the slovak parliament at an astonishing speed in 2003 , the tax is being treated warily by some in slovakia .
as part of the reform , lower taxes on certain foodstuffs and products that had meant spending relief for the working class were eliminated .
opposition politicians are concerned about the long-term consequences for those who don ’ t earn much , as slovakia angles for foreign companies . “ i ’ m not sure it ’ s fair to those people , ” said pavol pesca , an opposition parliamentarian from the poor eastern city of kosice .
“ maybe it ’ s fair in a more developed country with a bigger middle class . ” but that ’ s exactly what slovakia ’ s flat tax advocates argue will emerge in the central european country .
the tax reform , they say , will reward the middle class for earning and producing more , provided the investment keeps flowing in . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slovaks reject populist in presidential election voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win .

limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .

but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders . at the moment , the euro valley industrial park half an hour outside of bratislava is not much more than a name . subcontractors to nearby volkswagen slovakia and other car companies inhabit some of the nondescript buildings , but much of the park is uninhabited or undeveloped .
euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .

as german tv viewers are tiring of reality shows , broadcasters are re-discovering a format that 's promising to glue people to their screens on a daily basis : the kitschy world of telenovelas . having just spent four years in prison after a wrongful conviction for arson , bianca meets oliver , the handsome son of a rich banker .
she immediately falls in love with him only to see him marry another woman .
lisa , an ugly duckling , adores david , her boss at a berlin fashion label who barely notices her existence . things do n't seem to go too well for the women at the center of the most recent format to hit german television - the telenovela , a concept that 's been hugely popular in latin america for decades .
but viewers can rest assured that bianca and lisa will eventually get their men - even if they have to watch about 200 episodes to see the happy ending . fictional bliss the latter is what many germans seem to be looking for as bleak economic times make reality tv shows less appealing and instead nurture a longing for - albeit fictional - bliss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bianca berger " and " oliver wellinghoff " are the stars in zdf 's telenovela last november , german public broadcaster zdf launched the first german telenovela , " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . the show found a dedicated - mainly female - audience , prompting private broadcaster sat1 to follow suit this week : " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- smitten in berlin -rrb- aired for the first time on monday , attracting almost a third of viewers aged 14 to 19 . " people in germany are n't doing too well - that 's maybe why they want less reality and enjoy life 's nicer moments instead , " said rainer wemcken , the managing director of grundy ufa , which produces both " bianca " and " verliebt in berlin " along with several successful german soap operas . rehashing old concepts ? joan kristin bleicher , a professor at hamburg university 's hans bredow institute for media research , agreed that telenovelas showed germans were increasingly interested in fiction rather than court and talk shows , which lack an " ideal world " aspect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mathis künzler and alexandra neldel play the lead roles in " smitten in berlin " but the concept of long-running fictional shows with a limited storyline is not completely new to german television , bleicher said . " it 's an attempt to rehash a trend from the early 90s , " she said , adding that " verliebt in berlin " was similar to other popular daily soaps already on tv . keeping things simple wemcken countered that while soap operas stayed closer to real life , telenovelas were less " down to earth . "
by focusing on a single character , keeping the story line simple and limiting the duration , the format also required less of a commitment from increasingly busy viewers , he said . " that means viewers are more likely to watch it , " wemcken said , adding that his company is already in discussions with zdf as well as german public broadcaster ard to produce additional shows . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german tv soap celebrates 20 years when it began in 1985 , the soap opera " lindenstrasse " got miserable reviews and many predicted a short life for the series .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.03.2005 canada deports neo-nazi to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel faces arrest upon his arrival in germany right-wing extremist ernst zündel is due to arrive in germany on tuesday .
canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .
since then he 's been present at numerous neo-nazi gatherings and events worldwide . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .

a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

as german tv viewers are tiring of reality shows , broadcasters are re-discovering a format that 's promising to glue people to their screens on a daily basis : the kitschy world of telenovelas . having just spent four years in prison after a wrongful conviction for arson , bianca meets oliver , the handsome son of a rich banker .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .
since then he 's been present at numerous neo-nazi gatherings and events worldwide . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.03.2005 canada deports neo-nazi to germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel faces arrest upon his arrival in germany right-wing extremist ernst zündel is due to arrive in germany on tuesday .
canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .
since then he 's been present at numerous neo-nazi gatherings and events worldwide . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders . at the moment , the euro valley industrial park half an hour outside of bratislava is not much more than a name . subcontractors to nearby volkswagen slovakia and other car companies inhabit some of the nondescript buildings , but much of the park is uninhabited or undeveloped .
euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .
the country , which has already attracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has produced more than a million cars in bratislava german giants like volkswagen and siemens , looks forward to posing more problems for western european governments looking to stop the flow of companies moving eastwards . in addition to already cheaper labor , countries like ukraine , romania and slovakia have offered up the flat tax as an additional incentive for foreign companies . “ it definitely puts pressure on western europe , ” said kevin waddell , an eastern europe-based analyst with the boston consulting group . the giants respond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy european economic giants france and germany have already voiced their disapproval .
then french finance minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said that if the new member states could “ afford ” a flat tax - which traditionally leads to a decline in tax revenues - they wouldn ’ t need financial help from the european union .
chancellor gerhard schröder last year also criticized the new member states for taking aid from brussels while stealing business from western europe . “ it is certainly unreasonable that we finance an unbridled tax competition among each other via the budget of the european union , " schröder said last may . germany , by comparison , has an average corporate tax of 38 percent , a rate that economists consider one of the big reasons foreign companies are bypassing the former european giant .
but schröder shows no sign of budging . resistance to change in germany when germany ’ s council of economic advisors last summer recommended the government introduce a flat tax of 30 percent , their proposal was duly ignored . “ most politicians don ’ t think they can convince the population of the need for a unified tax rate , ” said wolfgang wiegard -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the economic council .
“ the reason is the concern in germany that the redistributive role of the tax system would be reduced . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wiegard , head of the economic advisors ' council like sweden , italy and france , germany has a massive social net to support .
a flat tax would mean taxing the rich at the same rate as the working class .
more importantly , it would mean less tax revenues flowing into the government coffers and less money to pay for unemployment insurance , pensions , education and so on . west should learn from east rather than adjust their tax rates too drastically , france and germany are at the moment trying to push the eu into introducing a unified corporate tax rate .
the strategy puzzles many in eastern europe . “ why should we be punished for the flat tax ? ” said jozef uhrlik , ceo of volkswagen slovakia , after a panel discussion in bratislava last week .
he then launched into a criticism of the union ’ s “ irrational ” labor policy , “ unrealistic ” environmental policy and massive agricultural budget . “ we have implemented something that is rational , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava , slovakia 's capital drafted and passed by the slovak parliament at an astonishing speed in 2003 , the tax is being treated warily by some in slovakia .
as part of the reform , lower taxes on certain foodstuffs and products that had meant spending relief for the working class were eliminated .
opposition politicians are concerned about the long-term consequences for those who don ’ t earn much , as slovakia angles for foreign companies . “ i ’ m not sure it ’ s fair to those people , ” said pavol pesca , an opposition parliamentarian from the poor eastern city of kosice .
“ maybe it ’ s fair in a more developed country with a bigger middle class . ” but that ’ s exactly what slovakia ’ s flat tax advocates argue will emerge in the central european country .
the tax reform , they say , will reward the middle class for earning and producing more , provided the investment keeps flowing in . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slovaks reject populist in presidential election voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win .

as german tv viewers are tiring of reality shows , broadcasters are re-discovering a format that 's promising to glue people to their screens on a daily basis : the kitschy world of telenovelas . having just spent four years in prison after a wrongful conviction for arson , bianca meets oliver , the handsome son of a rich banker .
she immediately falls in love with him only to see him marry another woman .
lisa , an ugly duckling , adores david , her boss at a berlin fashion label who barely notices her existence . things do n't seem to go too well for the women at the center of the most recent format to hit german television - the telenovela , a concept that 's been hugely popular in latin america for decades .
but viewers can rest assured that bianca and lisa will eventually get their men - even if they have to watch about 200 episodes to see the happy ending . fictional bliss the latter is what many germans seem to be looking for as bleak economic times make reality tv shows less appealing and instead nurture a longing for - albeit fictional - bliss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bianca berger " and " oliver wellinghoff " are the stars in zdf 's telenovela last november , german public broadcaster zdf launched the first german telenovela , " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . the show found a dedicated - mainly female - audience , prompting private broadcaster sat1 to follow suit this week : " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- smitten in berlin -rrb- aired for the first time on monday , attracting almost a third of viewers aged 14 to 19 .

" it 's an attempt to rehash a trend from the early 90s , " she said , adding that " verliebt in berlin " was similar to other popular daily soaps already on tv . keeping things simple wemcken countered that while soap operas stayed closer to real life , telenovelas were less " down to earth . "
by focusing on a single character , keeping the story line simple and limiting the duration , the format also required less of a commitment from increasingly busy viewers , he said . " that means viewers are more likely to watch it , " wemcken said , adding that his company is already in discussions with zdf as well as german public broadcaster ard to produce additional shows . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german tv soap celebrates 20 years when it began in 1985 , the soap opera " lindenstrasse " got miserable reviews and many predicted a short life for the series .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .

but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders . at the moment , the euro valley industrial park half an hour outside of bratislava is not much more than a name . subcontractors to nearby volkswagen slovakia and other car companies inhabit some of the nondescript buildings , but much of the park is uninhabited or undeveloped .
euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .
the country , which has already attracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has produced more than a million cars in bratislava german giants like volkswagen and siemens , looks forward to posing more problems for western european governments looking to stop the flow of companies moving eastwards . in addition to already cheaper labor , countries like ukraine , romania and slovakia have offered up the flat tax as an additional incentive for foreign companies . “ it definitely puts pressure on western europe , ” said kevin waddell , an eastern europe-based analyst with the boston consulting group . the giants respond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy european economic giants france and germany have already voiced their disapproval .
then french finance minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said that if the new member states could “ afford ” a flat tax - which traditionally leads to a decline in tax revenues - they wouldn ’ t need financial help from the european union .
chancellor gerhard schröder last year also criticized the new member states for taking aid from brussels while stealing business from western europe . “ it is certainly unreasonable that we finance an unbridled tax competition among each other via the budget of the european union , " schröder said last may . germany , by comparison , has an average corporate tax of 38 percent , a rate that economists consider one of the big reasons foreign companies are bypassing the former european giant .
but schröder shows no sign of budging . resistance to change in germany when germany ’ s council of economic advisors last summer recommended the government introduce a flat tax of 30 percent , their proposal was duly ignored . “ most politicians don ’ t think they can convince the population of the need for a unified tax rate , ” said wolfgang wiegard -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the economic council .
“ the reason is the concern in germany that the redistributive role of the tax system would be reduced . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wiegard , head of the economic advisors ' council like sweden , italy and france , germany has a massive social net to support .
a flat tax would mean taxing the rich at the same rate as the working class .
more importantly , it would mean less tax revenues flowing into the government coffers and less money to pay for unemployment insurance , pensions , education and so on . west should learn from east rather than adjust their tax rates too drastically , france and germany are at the moment trying to push the eu into introducing a unified corporate tax rate .
the strategy puzzles many in eastern europe . “ why should we be punished for the flat tax ? ” said jozef uhrlik , ceo of volkswagen slovakia , after a panel discussion in bratislava last week .
he then launched into a criticism of the union ’ s “ irrational ” labor policy , “ unrealistic ” environmental policy and massive agricultural budget . “ we have implemented something that is rational , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava , slovakia 's capital drafted and passed by the slovak parliament at an astonishing speed in 2003 , the tax is being treated warily by some in slovakia .
as part of the reform , lower taxes on certain foodstuffs and products that had meant spending relief for the working class were eliminated .
opposition politicians are concerned about the long-term consequences for those who don ’ t earn much , as slovakia angles for foreign companies . “ i ’ m not sure it ’ s fair to those people , ” said pavol pesca , an opposition parliamentarian from the poor eastern city of kosice .
“ maybe it ’ s fair in a more developed country with a bigger middle class . ” but that ’ s exactly what slovakia ’ s flat tax advocates argue will emerge in the central european country .
the tax reform , they say , will reward the middle class for earning and producing more , provided the investment keeps flowing in . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slovaks reject populist in presidential election voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2005 flat tax revolution puts europe on edge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax reform will attract more investors like volkswagen slovakia in bratislava last week , george w. bush praised slovakia 's new flat tax .
but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders . at the moment , the euro valley industrial park half an hour outside of bratislava is not much more than a name . subcontractors to nearby volkswagen slovakia and other car companies inhabit some of the nondescript buildings , but much of the park is uninhabited or undeveloped .
euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .
the country , which has already attracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has produced more than a million cars in bratislava german giants like volkswagen and siemens , looks forward to posing more problems for western european governments looking to stop the flow of companies moving eastwards . in addition to already cheaper labor , countries like ukraine , romania and slovakia have offered up the flat tax as an additional incentive for foreign companies . “ it definitely puts pressure on western europe , ” said kevin waddell , an eastern europe-based analyst with the boston consulting group . the giants respond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy european economic giants france and germany have already voiced their disapproval .
then french finance minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said that if the new member states could “ afford ” a flat tax - which traditionally leads to a decline in tax revenues - they wouldn ’ t need financial help from the european union .
chancellor gerhard schröder last year also criticized the new member states for taking aid from brussels while stealing business from western europe . “ it is certainly unreasonable that we finance an unbridled tax competition among each other via the budget of the european union , " schröder said last may . germany , by comparison , has an average corporate tax of 38 percent , a rate that economists consider one of the big reasons foreign companies are bypassing the former european giant .
but schröder shows no sign of budging . resistance to change in germany when germany ’ s council of economic advisors last summer recommended the government introduce a flat tax of 30 percent , their proposal was duly ignored . “ most politicians don ’ t think they can convince the population of the need for a unified tax rate , ” said wolfgang wiegard -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the economic council .
“ the reason is the concern in germany that the redistributive role of the tax system would be reduced . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wiegard , head of the economic advisors ' council like sweden , italy and france , germany has a massive social net to support .
a flat tax would mean taxing the rich at the same rate as the working class .
more importantly , it would mean less tax revenues flowing into the government coffers and less money to pay for unemployment insurance , pensions , education and so on . west should learn from east rather than adjust their tax rates too drastically , france and germany are at the moment trying to push the eu into introducing a unified corporate tax rate .
the strategy puzzles many in eastern europe . “ why should we be punished for the flat tax ? ” said jozef uhrlik , ceo of volkswagen slovakia , after a panel discussion in bratislava last week .
he then launched into a criticism of the union ’ s “ irrational ” labor policy , “ unrealistic ” environmental policy and massive agricultural budget . “ we have implemented something that is rational , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava , slovakia 's capital drafted and passed by the slovak parliament at an astonishing speed in 2003 , the tax is being treated warily by some in slovakia .
as part of the reform , lower taxes on certain foodstuffs and products that had meant spending relief for the working class were eliminated .
opposition politicians are concerned about the long-term consequences for those who don ’ t earn much , as slovakia angles for foreign companies . “ i ’ m not sure it ’ s fair to those people , ” said pavol pesca , an opposition parliamentarian from the poor eastern city of kosice .
“ maybe it ’ s fair in a more developed country with a bigger middle class . ” but that ’ s exactly what slovakia ’ s flat tax advocates argue will emerge in the central european country .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 01.03.2005 flat tax revolution puts europe on edge großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tax reform will attract more investors like volkswagen slovakia in bratislava last week , george w. bush praised slovakia 's new flat tax .
but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders . at the moment , the euro valley industrial park half an hour outside of bratislava is not much more than a name . subcontractors to nearby volkswagen slovakia and other car companies inhabit some of the nondescript buildings , but much of the park is uninhabited or undeveloped .
euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .
the country , which has already attracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has produced more than a million cars in bratislava german giants like volkswagen and siemens , looks forward to posing more problems for western european governments looking to stop the flow of companies moving eastwards . in addition to already cheaper labor , countries like ukraine , romania and slovakia have offered up the flat tax as an additional incentive for foreign companies . “ it definitely puts pressure on western europe , ” said kevin waddell , an eastern europe-based analyst with the boston consulting group . the giants respond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy european economic giants france and germany have already voiced their disapproval .
then french finance minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said that if the new member states could “ afford ” a flat tax - which traditionally leads to a decline in tax revenues - they wouldn ’ t need financial help from the european union .
chancellor gerhard schröder last year also criticized the new member states for taking aid from brussels while stealing business from western europe . “ it is certainly unreasonable that we finance an unbridled tax competition among each other via the budget of the european union , " schröder said last may . germany , by comparison , has an average corporate tax of 38 percent , a rate that economists consider one of the big reasons foreign companies are bypassing the former european giant .
but schröder shows no sign of budging . resistance to change in germany when germany ’ s council of economic advisors last summer recommended the government introduce a flat tax of 30 percent , their proposal was duly ignored . “ most politicians don ’ t think they can convince the population of the need for a unified tax rate , ” said wolfgang wiegard -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the economic council .
“ the reason is the concern in germany that the redistributive role of the tax system would be reduced . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wiegard , head of the economic advisors ' council like sweden , italy and france , germany has a massive social net to support .
a flat tax would mean taxing the rich at the same rate as the working class .
more importantly , it would mean less tax revenues flowing into the government coffers and less money to pay for unemployment insurance , pensions , education and so on . west should learn from east rather than adjust their tax rates too drastically , france and germany are at the moment trying to push the eu into introducing a unified corporate tax rate .
the strategy puzzles many in eastern europe . “ why should we be punished for the flat tax ? ” said jozef uhrlik , ceo of volkswagen slovakia , after a panel discussion in bratislava last week .
he then launched into a criticism of the union ’ s “ irrational ” labor policy , “ unrealistic ” environmental policy and massive agricultural budget . “ we have implemented something that is rational , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava , slovakia 's capital drafted and passed by the slovak parliament at an astonishing speed in 2003 , the tax is being treated warily by some in slovakia .
as part of the reform , lower taxes on certain foodstuffs and products that had meant spending relief for the working class were eliminated .
opposition politicians are concerned about the long-term consequences for those who don ’ t earn much , as slovakia angles for foreign companies . “ i ’ m not sure it ’ s fair to those people , ” said pavol pesca , an opposition parliamentarian from the poor eastern city of kosice .
“ maybe it ’ s fair in a more developed country with a bigger middle class . ” but that ’ s exactly what slovakia ’ s flat tax advocates argue will emerge in the central european country .
the tax reform , they say , will reward the middle class for earning and producing more , provided the investment keeps flowing in . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slovaks reject populist in presidential election voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win .
-lrb- april 18 , 2004 -rrb- eastern european economies revving their motors the ten new eu members , mostly in central and eastern europe , have set themselves on a path of strong economic growth .
low wages are attracting western companies and home-grown firms are attracting global attention .

but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders . at the moment , the euro valley industrial park half an hour outside of bratislava is not much more than a name . subcontractors to nearby volkswagen slovakia and other car companies inhabit some of the nondescript buildings , but much of the park is uninhabited or undeveloped .
euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .
the country , which has already attracted bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen has produced more than a million cars in bratislava german giants like volkswagen and siemens , looks forward to posing more problems for western european governments looking to stop the flow of companies moving eastwards . in addition to already cheaper labor , countries like ukraine , romania and slovakia have offered up the flat tax as an additional incentive for foreign companies . “ it definitely puts pressure on western europe , ” said kevin waddell , an eastern europe-based analyst with the boston consulting group . the giants respond bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy european economic giants france and germany have already voiced their disapproval .
then french finance minister nicolas sarkozy -lrb- photo -rrb- said that if the new member states could “ afford ” a flat tax - which traditionally leads to a decline in tax revenues - they wouldn ’ t need financial help from the european union .
chancellor gerhard schröder last year also criticized the new member states for taking aid from brussels while stealing business from western europe . “ it is certainly unreasonable that we finance an unbridled tax competition among each other via the budget of the european union , " schröder said last may . germany , by comparison , has an average corporate tax of 38 percent , a rate that economists consider one of the big reasons foreign companies are bypassing the former european giant .
but schröder shows no sign of budging . resistance to change in germany when germany ’ s council of economic advisors last summer recommended the government introduce a flat tax of 30 percent , their proposal was duly ignored . “ most politicians don ’ t think they can convince the population of the need for a unified tax rate , ” said wolfgang wiegard -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the economic council .
“ the reason is the concern in germany that the redistributive role of the tax system would be reduced . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wiegard , head of the economic advisors ' council like sweden , italy and france , germany has a massive social net to support .
a flat tax would mean taxing the rich at the same rate as the working class .
more importantly , it would mean less tax revenues flowing into the government coffers and less money to pay for unemployment insurance , pensions , education and so on . west should learn from east rather than adjust their tax rates too drastically , france and germany are at the moment trying to push the eu into introducing a unified corporate tax rate .
the strategy puzzles many in eastern europe . “ why should we be punished for the flat tax ? ” said jozef uhrlik , ceo of volkswagen slovakia , after a panel discussion in bratislava last week .
he then launched into a criticism of the union ’ s “ irrational ” labor policy , “ unrealistic ” environmental policy and massive agricultural budget . “ we have implemented something that is rational , ” he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava , slovakia 's capital drafted and passed by the slovak parliament at an astonishing speed in 2003 , the tax is being treated warily by some in slovakia .
as part of the reform , lower taxes on certain foodstuffs and products that had meant spending relief for the working class were eliminated .
opposition politicians are concerned about the long-term consequences for those who don ’ t earn much , as slovakia angles for foreign companies . “ i ’ m not sure it ’ s fair to those people , ” said pavol pesca , an opposition parliamentarian from the poor eastern city of kosice .
“ maybe it ’ s fair in a more developed country with a bigger middle class . ” but that ’ s exactly what slovakia ’ s flat tax advocates argue will emerge in the central european country .
the tax reform , they say , will reward the middle class for earning and producing more , provided the investment keeps flowing in . andreas tzortzis , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de slovaks reject populist in presidential election voters in slovakia have elected as president ivan gasparovic , a moderate , going against predictions that former populist prime minister vladimir meciar , who had been criticized for his anti-democratic rule , would win .

but what bush finds inspiring is infuriating western european leaders . at the moment , the euro valley industrial park half an hour outside of bratislava is not much more than a name . subcontractors to nearby volkswagen slovakia and other car companies inhabit some of the nondescript buildings , but much of the park is uninhabited or undeveloped .
euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .
but it is also leading to a clash between “ old ” and “ new ” europe on the future of competition and tax reform in the european union . the money keeps rolling in slovakia ’ s trade and development agency , sario , is already reporting a jump in the number of foreign investment projects , from 22 to 47 .

the strategy puzzles many in eastern europe . “ why should we be punished for the flat tax ? ” said jozef uhrlik , ceo of volkswagen slovakia , after a panel discussion in bratislava last week .

opposition politicians are concerned about the long-term consequences for those who don ’ t earn much , as slovakia angles for foreign companies . “ i ’ m not sure it ’ s fair to those people , ” said pavol pesca , an opposition parliamentarian from the poor eastern city of kosice .
“ maybe it ’ s fair in a more developed country with a bigger middle class . ” but that ’ s exactly what slovakia ’ s flat tax advocates argue will emerge in the central european country .

euro valley chairman ivan kocis , however , is not interested in the now , but in the future .
he is expecting all sorts of foreign investors , and his government ’ s decision last year to ratchet down tax rates to a uniform 19 percent is giving him reason for optimism . “ it is a very important factor , ” said kocis .
“ compared to austria , france and germany , the companies pay almost half ” of the taxes demanded by the government . on jan .
1 last year , slovakia became the eighth eastern european country - after estonia , russia , hungary , serbia , ukraine , lithuania and latvia - to introduce a flat-tax rate on income and corporate taxes .
the model , adopted this year by georgia and romania , is considered by economists to be the best way to jump-start an economy , by luring foreign investors with low tax rates .

but schröder shows no sign of budging . resistance to change in germany when germany ’ s council of economic advisors last summer recommended the government introduce a flat tax of 30 percent , their proposal was duly ignored . “ most politicians don ’ t think they can convince the population of the need for a unified tax rate , ” said wolfgang wiegard -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the economic council .
“ the reason is the concern in germany that the redistributive role of the tax system would be reduced . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang wiegard , head of the economic advisors ' council like sweden , italy and france , germany has a massive social net to support .

as german tv viewers are tiring of reality shows , broadcasters are re-discovering a format that 's promising to glue people to their screens on a daily basis : the kitschy world of telenovelas . having just spent four years in prison after a wrongful conviction for arson , bianca meets oliver , the handsome son of a rich banker .
she immediately falls in love with him only to see him marry another woman .
lisa , an ugly duckling , adores david , her boss at a berlin fashion label who barely notices her existence . things do n't seem to go too well for the women at the center of the most recent format to hit german television - the telenovela , a concept that 's been hugely popular in latin america for decades .
but viewers can rest assured that bianca and lisa will eventually get their men - even if they have to watch about 200 episodes to see the happy ending . fictional bliss the latter is what many germans seem to be looking for as bleak economic times make reality tv shows less appealing and instead nurture a longing for - albeit fictional - bliss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bianca berger " and " oliver wellinghoff " are the stars in zdf 's telenovela last november , german public broadcaster zdf launched the first german telenovela , " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . the show found a dedicated - mainly female - audience , prompting private broadcaster sat1 to follow suit this week : " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- smitten in berlin -rrb- aired for the first time on monday , attracting almost a third of viewers aged 14 to 19 . " people in germany are n't doing too well - that 's maybe why they want less reality and enjoy life 's nicer moments instead , " said rainer wemcken , the managing director of grundy ufa , which produces both " bianca " and " verliebt in berlin " along with several successful german soap operas . rehashing old concepts ? joan kristin bleicher , a professor at hamburg university 's hans bredow institute for media research , agreed that telenovelas showed germans were increasingly interested in fiction rather than court and talk shows , which lack an " ideal world " aspect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mathis künzler and alexandra neldel play the lead roles in " smitten in berlin " but the concept of long-running fictional shows with a limited storyline is not completely new to german television , bleicher said . " it 's an attempt to rehash a trend from the early 90s , " she said , adding that " verliebt in berlin " was similar to other popular daily soaps already on tv . keeping things simple wemcken countered that while soap operas stayed closer to real life , telenovelas were less " down to earth . "
by focusing on a single character , keeping the story line simple and limiting the duration , the format also required less of a commitment from increasingly busy viewers , he said . " that means viewers are more likely to watch it , " wemcken said , adding that his company is already in discussions with zdf as well as german public broadcaster ard to produce additional shows . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german tv soap celebrates 20 years when it began in 1985 , the soap opera " lindenstrasse " got miserable reviews and many predicted a short life for the series .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

it ’ s a pretty inauspicious place .
pale blue water .
fishing boats rocking at the pier .
a horse neighs in the background .
not the kind of place that you would expect a disaster .
and not a whole lot of disasters have happened there .
except for one .
in the summer of 2003 , the baltic sea heated up .
down in the estuary near maasholm , huge amounts of plants under the sea were killed .
many people probably never noticed these plants died .
but a group of scientists did – researchers from the max planck institute for limnology in plön , near kiel , a short drive south of maasholm .
limnologists study inland waters , and it just turns out , that these researchers themselves had laid down this sea grass , as part of experiments on bio-diversity and genetic diversity -lrb- we ’ ll talk about genetic diversity in a moment -rrb- .
after nature came and exterminated the sea grass en masse , the researchers had a very interesting question on their hands : how will the ecosystem , in the place these plants grew , recover ?
they discovered something remarkable : that genetic diversity helps an ecosystem recover from disaster .
now , it ’ s already known that bio-diversity helps .
let ’ s make clear what the difference between these two kinds of diversity is .
bio- diversity , as you probably know , refers generally to having lots of different kinds of living organisms – in the case of an estuary , seaweed , sea stars , small crabs , and many more , like in the picture on the right .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetic diversity means having lots of different kinds of otherwise similar organisms .
one example in history , where a lack of genetic diversity may have led to a true disaster – hundreds of thousands of people dying – was the irish potato famine of the mid 19th century .
there were so few genetic strains of potato in ireland that when a virus came , it wiped out almost instantly all the potatoes – and the staple food of the irish .
because of climate change , there seem to be more and more extreme events happening out there – heat waves , floods , storms .
so for natural preservationists , it ’ s useful to know how they can rebuild their populations , after disaster strikes .
otherwise , they ecosystems they ’ re preserving may never recover .
keeping genetic diversity may now be one important part of their work .

as german tv viewers are tiring of reality shows , broadcasters are re-discovering a format that 's promising to glue people to their screens on a daily basis : the kitschy world of telenovelas . having just spent four years in prison after a wrongful conviction for arson , bianca meets oliver , the handsome son of a rich banker .
she immediately falls in love with him only to see him marry another woman .
lisa , an ugly duckling , adores david , her boss at a berlin fashion label who barely notices her existence . things do n't seem to go too well for the women at the center of the most recent format to hit german television - the telenovela , a concept that 's been hugely popular in latin america for decades .
but viewers can rest assured that bianca and lisa will eventually get their men - even if they have to watch about 200 episodes to see the happy ending . fictional bliss the latter is what many germans seem to be looking for as bleak economic times make reality tv shows less appealing and instead nurture a longing for - albeit fictional - bliss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bianca berger " and " oliver wellinghoff " are the stars in zdf 's telenovela last november , german public broadcaster zdf launched the first german telenovela , " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . the show found a dedicated - mainly female - audience , prompting private broadcaster sat1 to follow suit this week : " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- smitten in berlin -rrb- aired for the first time on monday , attracting almost a third of viewers aged 14 to 19 . " people in germany are n't doing too well - that 's maybe why they want less reality and enjoy life 's nicer moments instead , " said rainer wemcken , the managing director of grundy ufa , which produces both " bianca " and " verliebt in berlin " along with several successful german soap operas . rehashing old concepts ? joan kristin bleicher , a professor at hamburg university 's hans bredow institute for media research , agreed that telenovelas showed germans were increasingly interested in fiction rather than court and talk shows , which lack an " ideal world " aspect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mathis künzler and alexandra neldel play the lead roles in " smitten in berlin " but the concept of long-running fictional shows with a limited storyline is not completely new to german television , bleicher said . " it 's an attempt to rehash a trend from the early 90s , " she said , adding that " verliebt in berlin " was similar to other popular daily soaps already on tv . keeping things simple wemcken countered that while soap operas stayed closer to real life , telenovelas were less " down to earth . "
by focusing on a single character , keeping the story line simple and limiting the duration , the format also required less of a commitment from increasingly busy viewers , he said . " that means viewers are more likely to watch it , " wemcken said , adding that his company is already in discussions with zdf as well as german public broadcaster ard to produce additional shows . mathis winkler , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first german tv soap celebrates 20 years when it began in 1985 , the soap opera " lindenstrasse " got miserable reviews and many predicted a short life for the series .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .
' ' the court has rightfully labeled zündel as a hatemonger and provocateur and therefore a danger to all canadians , " dimant told the canadian press . but canadian civil liberties association lawyer alan borovoy criticized the trial as unfair and zündel 's confinement for two years without charge unjustifiable , regardless of the plaintiff 's views . trial in germany according to canadian press reports , zündel is wanted on an outstanding warrant in germany .
he has been accused of denying the holocaust , a criminal offence in germany . he was convicted in absentia and fined for a similar offence several years ago , and is likely to get a substantial jail term if found guilty of a second offence . but precedents suggest that when zündel arrives in the country where he spent his first 19 years , he does n't necessarily have much to fear . frederick toben , a former german living in australia who also counts among the world 's hardcore prominent holocaust deniers , was one of the first people to be prosecuted under new legislation passed in late 2000 .
toben was sentenced to 10 months in prison , but was able to leave the country without serving the full jail term .

canada , his adopted home for two-thirds of his life , is extraditing him to face a german court in his country of birth for denying the holocaust . after ernst zündel spent two years in a toronto jail , a federal judge in ottawa decided the 65-year-old should be extradited to germany for presenting both a national and an international security risk .
zündel - who the german authorities will immediately arrest upon his arrival on tuesday , canadian press reported - is notorious for denying the holocaust and propagating neo-nazi and anti-semitic ideas . " mr. zundel 's activities are not only a threat to canada 's national security but also a threat to the international community of nations , " federal court justice blais richter said in his decision last week .
he described zündel as a hitler sympathizer determined to propagate the neo-nazi movement and a " leader of international significance " among white supremacists . according to german law , people who disperse nazi propaganda or deny the genocide against the jews , inciting racial hatred and disparaging the dead , may be sentenced to prison .
and even though zündel did n't do so from germany , he can still be held accountable here . virulently racist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zündel supporters in early feb. outside the canadian consulate in los angeles demanded he should be released from jail in toronto .
for years , zündel has published texts such as " why i love hitler " and pseudo-scientific studies claiming that people were n't killed in auschwitz , which he 's distributed by mail in germany and the united states .
although the canadian authorities temporarily blocked zündel from sending post , the advent of the internet allowed him to spread his theories without interference for some time .
zündel 's virulently racist and anti-semitic web site was eventually shut down but later brought back to life by his closest collaborators , including his wife . since immigrating to canada in 1958 , he has repeatedly been prosecuted for inciting racial hatred there but was only sentenced to negligible penalties .
still , he saw himself as a martyr and tried to escape the pressure by moving to the us in 2001 .
after two years , the us authorities deported him for overstaying his visa . back in canada , he was promptly arrested and a long legal wrangle began .
zündel , who has been denied canadian citizenship twice , tried applying for political asylum , which was also refused . more than a slap on the hand ? b 'nai brith and other jewish organizations in canada welcomed the decision to extradite zündel .
' ' it is time for zündel 's plane to take off .
this should mark a closure to the tireless efforts of many to bring zündel to justice , " said frank dimant , executive vice president of b 'nai brith of canada .

as german tv viewers are tiring of reality shows , broadcasters are re-discovering a format that 's promising to glue people to their screens on a daily basis : the kitschy world of telenovelas . having just spent four years in prison after a wrongful conviction for arson , bianca meets oliver , the handsome son of a rich banker .
she immediately falls in love with him only to see him marry another woman .
lisa , an ugly duckling , adores david , her boss at a berlin fashion label who barely notices her existence . things do n't seem to go too well for the women at the center of the most recent format to hit german television - the telenovela , a concept that 's been hugely popular in latin america for decades .
but viewers can rest assured that bianca and lisa will eventually get their men - even if they have to watch about 200 episodes to see the happy ending . fictional bliss the latter is what many germans seem to be looking for as bleak economic times make reality tv shows less appealing and instead nurture a longing for - albeit fictional - bliss . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " bianca berger " and " oliver wellinghoff " are the stars in zdf 's telenovela last november , german public broadcaster zdf launched the first german telenovela , " bianca - wege zum glück " -lrb- bianca - paths to happiness -rrb- . the show found a dedicated - mainly female - audience , prompting private broadcaster sat1 to follow suit this week : " verliebt in berlin " -lrb- smitten in berlin -rrb- aired for the first time on monday , attracting almost a third of viewers aged 14 to 19 .

the plaintiffs are seeking compensation from the us firms that manufactured the chemical for the military in the 1960s .
the alleged victims say the defoliant - which contains toxic dioxins - is responsible for health problems affecting millions of vietnamese .
however the chemical companies say no such link has been proved .
the defendants - which include dow chemical and the monsanto corporation - also argue that the us government is responsible for how the chemical was used , not the manufacturers .
they maintain that us courts can not punish corporations for carrying out the orders of a president exercising his powers as commander in chief .
birth defects the us justice department has urged the federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit .
in a brief filed in january , it said opening the courts to cases brought by former enemies would be a dangerous threat to presidential powers to wage war .
but jonathan moore , a lawyer representing the vietnamese plaintiffs , said the defence was asserting " extreme positions " to prevent the case being heard .
" are we going to allow the government to do whatever they want to do , on an assertion of executive privilege , or are there limits that even the us government ... and these chemical companies must obey ? " he said outside the new york court .
between 1962 and 1971 , large quantities of agent orange were sprayed across parts of vietnam to deprive communist north vietnamese forces of forest cover .
in 1984 , several chemical companies paid $ 180m -lrb- £ 93m -rrb- to settle a lawsuit with us war veterans , who said that their health had been affected by exposure to the substance .
agent orange was named after the colour of its container .
the active ingredient was a strain of dioxin that stripped the jungle bare .
in time , some contend , the dioxin spread to the food chain causing a proliferation of birth defects .
some babies were born without eyes or arms , or were missing internal organs .
a group representing alleged vietnamese victims says three million people were exposed to the chemical during the war , and at least one million suffer serious health problems today .

the plaintiffs are seeking compensation from the us firms that manufactured the chemical for the military in the 1960s .
the alleged victims say the defoliant - which contains toxic dioxins - is responsible for health problems affecting millions of vietnamese .
however the chemical companies say no such link has been proved .
the defendants - which include dow chemical and the monsanto corporation - also argue that the us government is responsible for how the chemical was used , not the manufacturers .
they maintain that us courts can not punish corporations for carrying out the orders of a president exercising his powers as commander in chief .
birth defects the us justice department has urged the federal judge to dismiss the lawsuit .
in a brief filed in january , it said opening the courts to cases brought by former enemies would be a dangerous threat to presidential powers to wage war .
but jonathan moore , a lawyer representing the vietnamese plaintiffs , said the defence was asserting " extreme positions " to prevent the case being heard .
" are we going to allow the government to do whatever they want to do , on an assertion of executive privilege , or are there limits that even the us government ... and these chemical companies must obey ? " he said outside the new york court .
between 1962 and 1971 , large quantities of agent orange were sprayed across parts of vietnam to deprive communist north vietnamese forces of forest cover .
in 1984 , several chemical companies paid $ 180m -lrb- £ 93m -rrb- to settle a lawsuit with us war veterans , who said that their health had been affected by exposure to the substance .
agent orange was named after the colour of its container .
the active ingredient was a strain of dioxin that stripped the jungle bare .
in time , some contend , the dioxin spread to the food chain causing a proliferation of birth defects .
some babies were born without eyes or arms , or were missing internal organs .
a group representing alleged vietnamese victims says three million people were exposed to the chemical during the war , and at least one million suffer serious health problems today .

the covers are still on , but many of the secrets are out across the city on monday night , the big firms threw a series of plush parties to give a " sneak peek " at their new models .
among the most lavish previews was bmw 's press event at geneva 's plush batiment des forces motrices , the huge dance theatre where the car maker 's latest 3-series model was unveiled .
photos of the discreet-looking car were leaked as early as last august and bmw has been arranging test drives of the car throughout winter .
the only unknown about the model , therefore , is how it will be received by car buyers and what its impact will be on the bavarian firm 's bottom line .
bmw is betting on it being a best-seller , and aims to build 350,000 3-series cars this year .
bmw also revealed plans to move further into the area for car-like crossover vehicles in the belief that both traditional models and mini-vans have had their day , chief executive helmut panke told bbc news .
made in germany ?
near the bmw event , bentley offered a sneak preview of its four-wheel drive flying spur , the four-door version of its continental grand tourer , at an equally lavish event .
there was much talk about the marque 's racing heritage and its british roots - along with a stiff rebuttal of rumours that the car is to be produced at parent volkswagen 's factory in dresden .
bentley 's new flying spur comes close to 200 miles an hour " dresden is a city in north germany ; we are going to be producing it in crewe , " bentley chief franz-josef paefgen said .
the company would not , however , rule out the option of producing some continentals in germany as an overflow solution should demand for the car warrant it .
just a few blocks away , mazda revealed its third-generation mx-5 .
the mx-5 has been one of the world 's best-selling roadsters , and mazda is hoping this slightly more spacious version will cement its pole position .

a luxurious if low-key alternative to traditional choices such as bmw and mercedes , its high-tech gadgets may well make it a successful niche model , though there are doubts that it will become more than that .

on the face of it , its design - with just three seats - feels odd .
but it is not alone : volvo , too is offering a three-seater concept car called the 3cc which will three seats be enough for volvo 's concept car ? will make its european premiere here in geneva .
aston martin , volvo 's sister-marque within ford 's premier automotive group , is unveiling its v8 vantage , a car it hopes will sell to the tune of 5,000 a year despite a price tag of more than 100,000 euros .
the ford subsidiary insists porsche , which will unveil two 911 convertibles , should be worried .
convertible colt general motors will make further efforts to sell us marques to europeans with its bls baby-cadillac and by further pushing its chevrolet europe model , which it makes together with daewoo of south korea .

speaking at a bmw event ahead of the geneva motor show , helmut panke predicted demand for such crossover vehicles would soar in europe .
in contrast , he said , the popularity of van-style seven-seat vehicles and traditional saloon cars would fade .
" customers are moving out of the mini-van -lrb- and -rrb- traditional concepts are not as attractive anymore , " he said .
" we have decided that bmw will enter the -lsb- crossover -rsb- segment , " he said in the clearest indication yet about the car maker 's intentions .
two trends mr panke praised the honda acura as the " best execution " yet of a crossover vehicle .
" we have decided that the bmw brand will enter the segment , " he said .
check bmw 's share price a decision on just how bmw will manage its entry into the new market is due in the first half of 2005 .
typically it takes about three years from when a decision is taken before a new model hits the streets , mr panke said , implying that a bmw crossover could be on the market by 2008 .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- wales -pipe- saint 's holiday debate goes on home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics education magazine business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 1 march , 2005 , 07:01 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version saint 's holiday debate goes on st david 's day : how do you think it should be celebrated ?
with st david 's day at hand , expect the debate to rage once again about whether or not wales should have a bank holiday to celebrate it .
organisations no less influential than the welsh assembly have called for one to be created .
but what would an additional bank holiday mean for the country ?
at present , st david 's day is mainly marked by schoolchildren putting on concerts for parents who can not watch them - because they are in work .
if it was a national holiday , presumably the parents would be free to attend - the only problem now is the children would have the day off school , so there would be no concerts to go and watch ...
bank holidays are known for three things - traffic jams , diy and drinking -lrb- hopefully in that order , if you happen to be tackling all three -rrb- . ... unlike the irish , famed for their enjoyment of st patrick 's day tacked on as they are to a weekend , they are handy for short breaks and family reunions .
but st david 's day is a little different .
the holiday , presumably , would occur not on the first monday in march , but on the day itself - not quite as convenient for either staff or businesses to work around if it was mid-week .
looking across the water , though , ireland has fully embraced its national day , and st patrick 's day celebrations in the republic have become a draw for tourists as well as locals , whatever the day .
the celebration has grown so much that dublin now boasts a five-day st patrick 's festival , which encompasses a parade on the day itself , and music , street theatre , fireworks and more in the days before and after .
no-one would question the marketing boost the celebrations have given the country - could the same happen here ?
the wales tourist board does not have a policy on lobbying for a bank holiday but spokesman michael greenow said they certainly used st david to promote wales as a destination .
the key lies in creating more festivals which can bring welsh culture to life wales tourist board " it 's a very important day in the welsh calendar and more and more people are finding ways to celebrate our patron saint , " he told the bbc news website .
" if wales is to emulate the success of st patrick 's day in ireland then the key lies in creating more festivals which can bring welsh culture to life . "
he pointed to the inauguration of a st david 's day parade in cardiff last year as a measure of the growth in its popularity .
business lobby group cbi wales is - perhaps unsurprisingly - ambivalent about any new bank holiday .
emma watkins , head of policy in wales , told the bbc news website the subject had been canvassed among its members .
whether -lsb- businesses -rsb- would actually support another bank holiday , i do n't know emma watkins , cbi " generally members are indifferent to it , half in favour , half against , " she said .
" if there is a bank holiday on st david 's day and the rest of the uk is working , it gives the impression wales is shut for business and that gives a bad impression .
" if there was a choice -lsb- between st david 's day or an additional fixed holiday for all of britain -rsb- employers would prefer it to be uniform .
" many employers and employees agree to swap bank holidays for other time off .
flexibility is the key . "
however she added : " whether they would actually support another bank holiday , i do n't know . "
while england , scotland and wales currently enjoy among the lowest public holidays per year in the eu with eight - the average is 12 - northern ireland has 10 .
st patrick 's day revellers out in force in belfast like its southern neighbour , it celebrates st patrick 's day , and also the battle of the boyne on 12 july , a reflection of the historically divided religious communities in the area .
ian morrow from the northern ireland chamber of commerce can not see that the additional holidays have a negative impact on the country 's economy , despite the fact the rest of the uk is in work .
" it 's hard to judge -lsb- the economic situation -rsb- but it 's not that detrimental , " he said .
" although people are off work , in belfast on st patrick 's day , with the parade through the town , the economic impact is neutral to good , with people who would n't normally be in town nipping in to shops . "
patients however he conceded : " while there would be a range of people off on those days , it 's by no means a national holiday .
" there would be a substantial amount of people still at work . "
civil servants , banks , and traditional heavy industries all had time off , he said , adding : " manufacturing and business has changed a lot .
the service-type industries and call-centres tend to operate 24/7 . "
" i 'd imagine st david 's day in wales would be more like st patrick 's day in the republic of ireland , where people do see it as a national holiday . "
bank holidays , whenever they fall , bring costs beyond simple cash considerations .
the cardiff and vale nhs trust stressed there would be knock-on effects for health services .
a spokeswoman said they would have to provide extra staff to cover holiday leave and find alternative times for treatments or outpatient clinics , which would affect patients .
" our patients ' needs do n't stop because there 's a bank holiday .
we have to provide the same number of treatments but have less time to do them , " she added .
they need not worry yet .
the latest communiqué from welsh secretary peter hain , delivered in the house of commons just a few weeks ago , is the argument for a day off for dewi sant is far from being won .
on monday , he revealed he was " open-minded " about the idea of a holiday on 1 march , but said that there had to be full consultation on the policy .

with st david 's day at hand , expect the debate to rage once again about whether or not wales should have a bank holiday to celebrate it .
organisations no less influential than the welsh assembly have called for one to be created .
but what would an additional bank holiday mean for the country ?
at present , st david 's day is mainly marked by schoolchildren putting on concerts for parents who can not watch them - because they are in work .
if it was a national holiday , presumably the parents would be free to attend - the only problem now is the children would have the day off school , so there would be no concerts to go and watch ...
bank holidays are known for three things - traffic jams , diy and drinking -lrb- hopefully in that order , if you happen to be tackling all three -rrb- . ... unlike the irish , famed for their enjoyment of st patrick 's day tacked on as they are to a weekend , they are handy for short breaks and family reunions .
but st david 's day is a little different .
the holiday , presumably , would occur not on the first monday in march , but on the day itself - not quite as convenient for either staff or businesses to work around if it was mid-week .
looking across the water , though , ireland has fully embraced its national day , and st patrick 's day celebrations in the republic have become a draw for tourists as well as locals , whatever the day .
the celebration has grown so much that dublin now boasts a five-day st patrick 's festival , which encompasses a parade on the day itself , and music , street theatre , fireworks and more in the days before and after .
no-one would question the marketing boost the celebrations have given the country - could the same happen here ?
the wales tourist board does not have a policy on lobbying for a bank holiday but spokesman michael greenow said they certainly used st david to promote wales as a destination .
the key lies in creating more festivals which can bring welsh culture to life wales tourist board " it 's a very important day in the welsh calendar and more and more people are finding ways to celebrate our patron saint , " he told the bbc news website .
" if wales is to emulate the success of st patrick 's day in ireland then the key lies in creating more festivals which can bring welsh culture to life . "
he pointed to the inauguration of a st david 's day parade in cardiff last year as a measure of the growth in its popularity .
business lobby group cbi wales is - perhaps unsurprisingly - ambivalent about any new bank holiday .
emma watkins , head of policy in wales , told the bbc news website the subject had been canvassed among its members .
whether -lsb- businesses -rsb- would actually support another bank holiday , i do n't know emma watkins , cbi " generally members are indifferent to it , half in favour , half against , " she said .
" if there is a bank holiday on st david 's day and the rest of the uk is working , it gives the impression wales is shut for business and that gives a bad impression .
" if there was a choice -lsb- between st david 's day or an additional fixed holiday for all of britain -rsb- employers would prefer it to be uniform .
" many employers and employees agree to swap bank holidays for other time off .
flexibility is the key . "
however she added : " whether they would actually support another bank holiday , i do n't know . "
while england , scotland and wales currently enjoy among the lowest public holidays per year in the eu with eight - the average is 12 - northern ireland has 10 .
st patrick 's day revellers out in force in belfast like its southern neighbour , it celebrates st patrick 's day , and also the battle of the boyne on 12 july , a reflection of the historically divided religious communities in the area .
ian morrow from the northern ireland chamber of commerce can not see that the additional holidays have a negative impact on the country 's economy , despite the fact the rest of the uk is in work .
" it 's hard to judge -lsb- the economic situation -rsb- but it 's not that detrimental , " he said .
" although people are off work , in belfast on st patrick 's day , with the parade through the town , the economic impact is neutral to good , with people who would n't normally be in town nipping in to shops . "
patients however he conceded : " while there would be a range of people off on those days , it 's by no means a national holiday .
" there would be a substantial amount of people still at work . "
civil servants , banks , and traditional heavy industries all had time off , he said , adding : " manufacturing and business has changed a lot .
the service-type industries and call-centres tend to operate 24/7 . "
" i 'd imagine st david 's day in wales would be more like st patrick 's day in the republic of ireland , where people do see it as a national holiday . "
bank holidays , whenever they fall , bring costs beyond simple cash considerations .
the cardiff and vale nhs trust stressed there would be knock-on effects for health services .
a spokeswoman said they would have to provide extra staff to cover holiday leave and find alternative times for treatments or outpatient clinics , which would affect patients .
" our patients ' needs do n't stop because there 's a bank holiday .
we have to provide the same number of treatments but have less time to do them , " she added .
they need not worry yet .
the latest communiqué from welsh secretary peter hain , delivered in the house of commons just a few weeks ago , is the argument for a day off for dewi sant is far from being won .
on monday , he revealed he was " open-minded " about the idea of a holiday on 1 march , but said that there had to be full consultation on the policy .
" wales ' and england 's economies are so intergrated that we really need to work this through in considerable detail , " he said .

the law , which will come into force early next year , seeks to increase the usage of solar and wind power to 10 % of china 's total consumption .
however , while the new law has been welcomed , it has been suggested that the targets are over ambitious .
rising oil prices and concerns over environmental damage prompted the move .
at present china relies on coal for most of its power , mining 1.8bn tons in 2004 .
by fixing prices for electricity from solar and wind generated power , the government hopes to create financial incentives for existing operators and attract investment to these new markets .
tough target but while there has been rapid expansion in the sustainable energy sector , it currently provides only a fraction of china 's needs .
wind generated electricity only contributes 0.01 % to the power grid .
to increase that to 10 % in five years is an optimistic target .
wim landsink of the dannan wind power company suspects it will not be attainable .
" it 's going to be difficult , " he said .
" there is currently a lack of power , there is a huge amount of new power capacity under development , which mainly is still coal -lrb- based -rrb- .
i do n't think in the coming years the environmental problems will get less , they will still increase . "
and there have been arguments about the definition of sustainable energy .
some members of the governing committee that passed the bill want to include hydroelectric plants , such as the three gorges dam , in that category .
others argue that the resources and costs involved in such mega projects mean they can not be included .
but the fact that this law has been passed at all indicates that the environmental costs of china 's rapid expansion can not be borne for much longer .

the law , which will come into force early next year , seeks to increase the usage of solar and wind power to 10 % of china 's total consumption .
however , while the new law has been welcomed , it has been suggested that the targets are over ambitious .
rising oil prices and concerns over environmental damage prompted the move .
at present china relies on coal for most of its power , mining 1.8bn tons in 2004 .
by fixing prices for electricity from solar and wind generated power , the government hopes to create financial incentives for existing operators and attract investment to these new markets .
tough target but while there has been rapid expansion in the sustainable energy sector , it currently provides only a fraction of china 's needs .
wind generated electricity only contributes 0.01 % to the power grid .
to increase that to 10 % in five years is an optimistic target .
wim landsink of the dannan wind power company suspects it will not be attainable .
" it 's going to be difficult , " he said .
" there is currently a lack of power , there is a huge amount of new power capacity under development , which mainly is still coal -lrb- based -rrb- .
i do n't think in the coming years the environmental problems will get less , they will still increase . "
and there have been arguments about the definition of sustainable energy .
some members of the governing committee that passed the bill want to include hydroelectric plants , such as the three gorges dam , in that category .
others argue that the resources and costs involved in such mega projects mean they can not be included .
but the fact that this law has been passed at all indicates that the environmental costs of china 's rapid expansion can not be borne for much longer .

those arrested could face heavy fines , jail sentences and whipping .
police officers , immigration officials and volunteer reservists launched the round-up shortly after the deadline for foreigners to leave passed at midnight .
the start of operation tegas was low key , with just a few hundred police and volunteers setting out from bases in the small hours of the morning .
the squads visited building sites , plantations and restaurants - all popular work places for illegal migrants .
i know what i have done is wrong .
but i need the money to support my family detained worker sumiyati in pictures : round up begins one of their first stops was a construction site outside the capital where , according to reports , at least 40 foreigners were arrested having failed to produce proper documentation .
some illegal immigrants fled into the nearby forest in the dark , but returned to give themselves up , the french news agency afp said .
one of those arrested , sumiyati , from the indonesian province of south sulawesi , cried as she told reporters : " i know what i have done is wrong .
but i need the money to support my family .
i will accept whatever comes .
i place my life in the hands of allah . "
' no safe havens ' the chief of a volunteer force which is at the head of the campaign to drive out the illegal workers , mahadi arshad , explained the procedure .
" we will detain them for 14 days and check out their documents , " he told reuters news agency .
" then immigration authorities will decide whether to deport or to detain them . "
illegal workforce 400,000-600,000 foreigners have already left at least 200,000 remain many work in construction , plantations and domestic service they risk jail , fines and whipping if found the government says it will deploy 25,000 frontline personnel with another 290,000 in reserve .
its immigration chief says there will be no safe havens and his officers will search towns , villages and even the jungle .
estimates of the number of illegal migrants in the country vary , but it is thought that more than half a million may have ignored an offer of help to return legally if they left during the amnesty .
the deportation operation is sure to be closely scrutinised , not least by indonesia and the philippines , from where most of the migrants come .
indonesia 's labour minister yesterday told a malaysian news website that 100,000 of his country 's citizens are refusing to leave malaysia until they are given money owed them by their employers .
human rights groups have called on the government here to suspend deportations , saying that it fails to tackle the root causes of the problem - the willingness of many malaysian employers to break the law and take on foreign staff without work permits .

the building was specially designed to house the new computerised tamar boat , which has a top speed of 25 knots .
tenby will become the first place in the uk to permanently take one of the £ 2m boats .
the pembrokeshire station is one of the busiest in wales , with 63 launches rescuing 35 people in the past year . "
once in a crewman 's lifespan you may get to see a new boat but to get a new boat and station is a privilege " bob james , tenby lifeboat the old station is now 100 years old and when the rnli looked at replacing the existing tyne class lifeboat with one of the new tamars it realised a new station would be needed .
training coordinator for tenby lifeboat , bob james , said : " the old lifeboat station was built for a 36ft rowing and sailing boat and has been extended twice to take different types of boats as they progressed .
" in the past the rnli has designed lifeboats to fit into different stations and it 's always the aim to provide new all weather lifeboats every 20 years or so .
" they would either have had to extend or rebuild and they 've gone for the building of a new station . "
it also provides the 32-strong crew with much needed facilities such as toilets and a meeting area .
an area has been set aside for selling merchandise and viewing platforms will enable tourists to watch the boat being launched .
mr james said constructing the building on the side of a cliff face had thrown up a number of challenges .
" you can not bring lorries down through the streets , the heaviest vehicles that come into town are the dray lorries delivering beer to the pubs , " he explained .
most material was brought two miles by sea .
the tamar lifeboat undergoing sea trials at the station this week is a pre-production model , with tenby 's £ 2m permanent boat likely to be delivered in september .
it will be named the haydn miller in honour of the donor who left a large bequest that paid for it .
mr james said it would be capable of faster rescue times and on board computer controls meant it would safer and more easily manageable for the crew .
" once in a crewman 's lifespan you may get to see a new boat but to get a new boat and station is a privilege , " added mr james .
" everybody is really over the moon and excited . "
