the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : france and the eu 's future chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution courting the constitution expected french ' non ' hits euro french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back europe -pipe- 24.05.2005 french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " non " campaign is still leading the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .
according to an ifop poll for paris match magazine to hit the newsstands on tuesday , 54 percent of voters would say " no " , two more percentage points than in the previous survey of may 19-20 .
the " yes " vote slipped two points to 46 percent . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , left , look on as french president jacques chirac answers questionas during a joint media conference in nancy , eastern france , thursday may 19 , 2005 .
the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.05.2005 show on art in auschwitz opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wlodzimierz siwierski smuggled out art , taping drawings to his body the judaicum center in berlin 's new synagogue is set to open an exhibition of some 170 works by 44 concentration camp inmates entitled " art in auschwitz 1940-1945 . " on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .
supervised artistic activity much of the work exhibited was made by polish artists .
before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among them was franciszek targosz , whose sketches so impressed auschwitz commandant rudolf höss that he approved targosz 's idea to set up a camp museum .
targosz was named head of the museum , founded in october , 1941 .
it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .
jewish artists , however , were never admitted .
a way of forgetting to the inmates , art offered an escape - a way of processing their experience , proof of their existence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i drew portraits in the camp as a way of finding a short-lived happiness and first and foremost , as a way of forgetting , " wrote the artist franciszek jazwiecki in 1946 .
" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .
by taking on the role of an ' observer , ' i could at least for a few moments detach myself from what was going on in auschwitz and was therefore better able to hold together the threads of sanity . "

" on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .
supervised artistic activity much of the work exhibited was made by polish artists .
before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among them was franciszek targosz , whose sketches so impressed auschwitz commandant rudolf höss that he approved targosz 's idea to set up a camp museum .
targosz was named head of the museum , founded in october , 1941 .
it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .
jewish artists , however , were never admitted .
a way of forgetting to the inmates , art offered an escape - a way of processing their experience , proof of their existence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i drew portraits in the camp as a way of finding a short-lived happiness and first and foremost , as a way of forgetting , " wrote the artist franciszek jazwiecki in 1946 .
" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .
by taking on the role of an ' observer , ' i could at least for a few moments detach myself from what was going on in auschwitz and was therefore better able to hold together the threads of sanity . "
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " runs through aug .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .

aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake .

france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .
the eu has set quantitative threshold values which , if overstepped , are meant to be resolved with china through informal negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , gestures during a meeting with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai speaking at the world economic forum on monday , the eu 's mandelson said that he opposes the return of quotas on chinese textiles , but added that the flood of cheap clothing shipments needed to be quelled . " that transition needs to be managed , " mandelson said , but added : " i do n't regard china as a threat in the medium or long term .
i regard china as an opportunity . " disadvantaging consumers ? just like the american government , the eu commission is mainly concerned with domestic companies and jobs that are threatened by the gigantic increases in china 's exports . chinese trade minister bo xilai said that industrial countries only support free trade when it 's to their advantage .
when they see their interests being threatened , though , they reach for " protective measures . " according to the wto , such " double standards " are not allowed .
the german chamber of commerce is just one of the voices warning that a retreat to the trade restrictions previously governing the textile industry would mean sliding back into protectionism that would only serve to disadvantage consumers buying textiles on the european and us markets . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hoping for amicable chinese textile deal germany will act " in solidarity " with its european partners in the trade row with china over cheap textile imports , but berlin is hoping that an amicable deal can be reached , the german economy minister said friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 a madam chancellor for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , happy day : merkel 's mood soared as her cdu took a key state after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .
according to an ifop poll for paris match magazine to hit the newsstands on tuesday , 54 percent of voters would say " no " , two more percentage points than in the previous survey of may 19-20 .
the " yes " vote slipped two points to 46 percent . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , left , look on as french president jacques chirac answers questionas during a joint media conference in nancy , eastern france , thursday may 19 , 2005 .
the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .

" in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .
it is not a vital center , like in vienna or paris , " läpple said .
" the hafencity could give the entire center new impulses .

" on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .
supervised artistic activity much of the work exhibited was made by polish artists .
before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among them was franciszek targosz , whose sketches so impressed auschwitz commandant rudolf höss that he approved targosz 's idea to set up a camp museum .
targosz was named head of the museum , founded in october , 1941 .
it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .
jewish artists , however , were never admitted .
a way of forgetting to the inmates , art offered an escape - a way of processing their experience , proof of their existence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i drew portraits in the camp as a way of finding a short-lived happiness and first and foremost , as a way of forgetting , " wrote the artist franciszek jazwiecki in 1946 .
" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .
by taking on the role of an ' observer , ' i could at least for a few moments detach myself from what was going on in auschwitz and was therefore better able to hold together the threads of sanity . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 a madam chancellor for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , happy day : merkel 's mood soared as her cdu took a key state after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

" motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .

" motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .

" on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .
supervised artistic activity much of the work exhibited was made by polish artists .
before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among them was franciszek targosz , whose sketches so impressed auschwitz commandant rudolf höss that he approved targosz 's idea to set up a camp museum .
targosz was named head of the museum , founded in october , 1941 .
it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .
jewish artists , however , were never admitted .
a way of forgetting to the inmates , art offered an escape - a way of processing their experience , proof of their existence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i drew portraits in the camp as a way of finding a short-lived happiness and first and foremost , as a way of forgetting , " wrote the artist franciszek jazwiecki in 1946 .
" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .
by taking on the role of an ' observer , ' i could at least for a few moments detach myself from what was going on in auschwitz and was therefore better able to hold together the threads of sanity . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.05.2005 hamburg 's harbor of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafencity 's plaza : like the rest of the project , still under construction on an island inhabited for years by old storage yards and warehouses , the city of hamburg is embarking on one of the biggest redevelopment projects in europe in recent years . in the coming years , hafencity will rise on the banks of the elbe , offering the city a rare opportunity to completely reshape its downtown area and - officials hope - bring it on par with european metropolises like barcelona and london . " compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .
it is not a vital center , like in vienna or paris , " läpple said .
" the hafencity could give the entire center new impulses .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .
the eu has set quantitative threshold values which , if overstepped , are meant to be resolved with china through informal negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , gestures during a meeting with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai speaking at the world economic forum on monday , the eu 's mandelson said that he opposes the return of quotas on chinese textiles , but added that the flood of cheap clothing shipments needed to be quelled . " that transition needs to be managed , " mandelson said , but added : " i do n't regard china as a threat in the medium or long term .
i regard china as an opportunity . " disadvantaging consumers ? just like the american government , the eu commission is mainly concerned with domestic companies and jobs that are threatened by the gigantic increases in china 's exports . chinese trade minister bo xilai said that industrial countries only support free trade when it 's to their advantage .
when they see their interests being threatened , though , they reach for " protective measures . " according to the wto , such " double standards " are not allowed .
the german chamber of commerce is just one of the voices warning that a retreat to the trade restrictions previously governing the textile industry would mean sliding back into protectionism that would only serve to disadvantage consumers buying textiles on the european and us markets . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hoping for amicable chinese textile deal germany will act " in solidarity " with its european partners in the trade row with china over cheap textile imports , but berlin is hoping that an amicable deal can be reached , the german economy minister said friday .

which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .

known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "

since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .
the eu has set quantitative threshold values which , if overstepped , are meant to be resolved with china through informal negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , gestures during a meeting with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai speaking at the world economic forum on monday , the eu 's mandelson said that he opposes the return of quotas on chinese textiles , but added that the flood of cheap clothing shipments needed to be quelled . " that transition needs to be managed , " mandelson said , but added : " i do n't regard china as a threat in the medium or long term .
i regard china as an opportunity . " disadvantaging consumers ? just like the american government , the eu commission is mainly concerned with domestic companies and jobs that are threatened by the gigantic increases in china 's exports . chinese trade minister bo xilai said that industrial countries only support free trade when it 's to their advantage .
when they see their interests being threatened , though , they reach for " protective measures . " according to the wto , such " double standards " are not allowed .
the german chamber of commerce is just one of the voices warning that a retreat to the trade restrictions previously governing the textile industry would mean sliding back into protectionism that would only serve to disadvantage consumers buying textiles on the european and us markets . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hoping for amicable chinese textile deal germany will act " in solidarity " with its european partners in the trade row with china over cheap textile imports , but berlin is hoping that an amicable deal can be reached , the german economy minister said friday .

the eu is set to launch a probe into china 's exploding textile exports this week just as trade officials are warning that doing so could be perilous to trade structures and other industries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.05.2005 hamburg 's harbor of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafencity 's plaza : like the rest of the project , still under construction on an island inhabited for years by old storage yards and warehouses , the city of hamburg is embarking on one of the biggest redevelopment projects in europe in recent years . in the coming years , hafencity will rise on the banks of the elbe , offering the city a rare opportunity to completely reshape its downtown area and - officials hope - bring it on par with european metropolises like barcelona and london . " compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .
it is not a vital center , like in vienna or paris , " läpple said .
" the hafencity could give the entire center new impulses .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

" on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .
supervised artistic activity much of the work exhibited was made by polish artists .
before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among them was franciszek targosz , whose sketches so impressed auschwitz commandant rudolf höss that he approved targosz 's idea to set up a camp museum .
targosz was named head of the museum , founded in october , 1941 .
it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .
jewish artists , however , were never admitted .
a way of forgetting to the inmates , art offered an escape - a way of processing their experience , proof of their existence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i drew portraits in the camp as a way of finding a short-lived happiness and first and foremost , as a way of forgetting , " wrote the artist franciszek jazwiecki in 1946 .
" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .
by taking on the role of an ' observer , ' i could at least for a few moments detach myself from what was going on in auschwitz and was therefore better able to hold together the threads of sanity . "

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .

the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 lawyer : us evidence clears 9/11 suspect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo jacob says his client mounir el motassadeq will be cleared the defense lawyer for a moroccan accused of involvement in the september 11 attacks in 2001 said on tuesday that new documents supplied by the us justice department would clear his client . lawyer udo jacob said the documents containing details of interviews with two suspected planners of the attacks fail to prove that the accused , mounir el motassadeq , was aware of the plot to fly planes into the world trade center and the pentagon . " motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .
washington has informed berlin that it will not supply any further documents for use in motassadeq 's trial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects the domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution , presented its annual report in berlin tuesday .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .

the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .
according to an ifop poll for paris match magazine to hit the newsstands on tuesday , 54 percent of voters would say " no " , two more percentage points than in the previous survey of may 19-20 .
the " yes " vote slipped two points to 46 percent . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , left , look on as french president jacques chirac answers questionas during a joint media conference in nancy , eastern france , thursday may 19 , 2005 .
the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .

the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 a madam chancellor for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , happy day : merkel 's mood soared as her cdu took a key state after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .

reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .

according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .
the eu has set quantitative threshold values which , if overstepped , are meant to be resolved with china through informal negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , gestures during a meeting with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai speaking at the world economic forum on monday , the eu 's mandelson said that he opposes the return of quotas on chinese textiles , but added that the flood of cheap clothing shipments needed to be quelled .

when they see their interests being threatened , though , they reach for " protective measures . " according to the wto , such " double standards " are not allowed .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .

" on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .
supervised artistic activity much of the work exhibited was made by polish artists .
before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among them was franciszek targosz , whose sketches so impressed auschwitz commandant rudolf höss that he approved targosz 's idea to set up a camp museum .
targosz was named head of the museum , founded in october , 1941 .
it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .
jewish artists , however , were never admitted .
a way of forgetting to the inmates , art offered an escape - a way of processing their experience , proof of their existence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i drew portraits in the camp as a way of finding a short-lived happiness and first and foremost , as a way of forgetting , " wrote the artist franciszek jazwiecki in 1946 .
" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .
by taking on the role of an ' observer , ' i could at least for a few moments detach myself from what was going on in auschwitz and was therefore better able to hold together the threads of sanity . "

" on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .
supervised artistic activity much of the work exhibited was made by polish artists .
before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : among them was franciszek targosz , whose sketches so impressed auschwitz commandant rudolf höss that he approved targosz 's idea to set up a camp museum .
targosz was named head of the museum , founded in october , 1941 .
it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .
jewish artists , however , were never admitted .
a way of forgetting to the inmates , art offered an escape - a way of processing their experience , proof of their existence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i drew portraits in the camp as a way of finding a short-lived happiness and first and foremost , as a way of forgetting , " wrote the artist franciszek jazwiecki in 1946 .
" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .
by taking on the role of an ' observer , ' i could at least for a few moments detach myself from what was going on in auschwitz and was therefore better able to hold together the threads of sanity . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i drew portraits in the camp as a way of finding a short-lived happiness and first and foremost , as a way of forgetting , " wrote the artist franciszek jazwiecki in 1946 .
" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .
by taking on the role of an ' observer , ' i could at least for a few moments detach myself from what was going on in auschwitz and was therefore better able to hold together the threads of sanity . "

" motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.05.2005 hamburg 's harbor of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafencity 's plaza : like the rest of the project , still under construction on an island inhabited for years by old storage yards and warehouses , the city of hamburg is embarking on one of the biggest redevelopment projects in europe in recent years . in the coming years , hafencity will rise on the banks of the elbe , offering the city a rare opportunity to completely reshape its downtown area and - officials hope - bring it on par with european metropolises like barcelona and london . " compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .
it is not a vital center , like in vienna or paris , " läpple said .
" the hafencity could give the entire center new impulses .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.05.2005 oecd predicts slower growth for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at best , germany is looking at snail-paced economic growth the organization of economic cooperation and development has slashed its growth forecasts for the german economy , predicting it would remain in breach of the eu 's budget rules both this and next year . the oecd also urged berlin to press ahead with its economic reforms following chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election in a high-stakes gamble aimed at defending his ambitious program of social and labor market reforms . in its spring economic outlook , the oecd predicted that the german economy would grow by around 1.25 percent this year and 1.75 percent next year as the upswing broadens . the forecasts are drastically lower than those in the oecd 's autumn report , when the think-tank had been penciling in growth of 1.4 percent for the euro zone 's biggest economy in 2005 and 2.3 percent in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work tails off for many come the winter the forecasts are adjusted to take account of inflation , seasonal factors and the differing number of working days . " growth remains weak and heavily dependent on foreign demand , " the oecd wrote .
" but both non-residential investment and - somewhat later - household consumption are projected to pick up in the course of 2005 . " public deficit problem nevertheless , growth would still not be strong enough to curb germany 's public deficit which has already exceeded eu limits for the past three years and is expected to do so again both in 2005 and 2006 . under the terms of the european growth and stability pact , euro zone countries are not allowed to run up deficits in excess of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . the german deficit ratio stood at 3.6 percent in 2004 and the government has vowed to bring it back below the 3 percent limit this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a race against the clock for hans eichel however , most experts remain skeptical and even finance minister hans eichel conceded recently that the goal was becoming increasingly difficult as growth consistently disappoints , tax revenues fall short of target and unemployment payments soar . need for further reforms the oecd predicted that the german deficit would amount to 3.5 percent of gdp again in 2005 , falling only slightly to 3.25 percent in 2006 , adding that further structural reforms were necessary to pull germany out of its current economic quagmire . " for economic performance to be raised in a durable way , reforms have to be continued and deepened within a coherent framework , " the organization wrote . but it was precisely the vast program of such reforms introduced by the current administration under schröder that has seen the popularity of the ruling social democrat spd party slump to all-time lows in the opinion polls . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .

" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .

" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .
according to an ifop poll for paris match magazine to hit the newsstands on tuesday , 54 percent of voters would say " no " , two more percentage points than in the previous survey of may 19-20 .
the " yes " vote slipped two points to 46 percent . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , left , look on as french president jacques chirac answers questionas during a joint media conference in nancy , eastern france , thursday may 19 , 2005 .
the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .

developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.05.2005 hamburg 's harbor of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafencity 's plaza : like the rest of the project , still under construction on an island inhabited for years by old storage yards and warehouses , the city of hamburg is embarking on one of the biggest redevelopment projects in europe in recent years . in the coming years , hafencity will rise on the banks of the elbe , offering the city a rare opportunity to completely reshape its downtown area and - officials hope - bring it on par with european metropolises like barcelona and london . " compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .
it is not a vital center , like in vienna or paris , " läpple said .
" the hafencity could give the entire center new impulses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 lawyer : us evidence clears 9/11 suspect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo jacob says his client mounir el motassadeq will be cleared the defense lawyer for a moroccan accused of involvement in the september 11 attacks in 2001 said on tuesday that new documents supplied by the us justice department would clear his client . lawyer udo jacob said the documents containing details of interviews with two suspected planners of the attacks fail to prove that the accused , mounir el motassadeq , was aware of the plot to fly planes into the world trade center and the pentagon . " motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 lawyer : us evidence clears 9/11 suspect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo jacob says his client mounir el motassadeq will be cleared the defense lawyer for a moroccan accused of involvement in the september 11 attacks in 2001 said on tuesday that new documents supplied by the us justice department would clear his client . lawyer udo jacob said the documents containing details of interviews with two suspected planners of the attacks fail to prove that the accused , mounir el motassadeq , was aware of the plot to fly planes into the world trade center and the pentagon . " motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .
washington has informed berlin that it will not supply any further documents for use in motassadeq 's trial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects the domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution , presented its annual report in berlin tuesday .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .
the eu has set quantitative threshold values which , if overstepped , are meant to be resolved with china through informal negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , gestures during a meeting with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai speaking at the world economic forum on monday , the eu 's mandelson said that he opposes the return of quotas on chinese textiles , but added that the flood of cheap clothing shipments needed to be quelled . " that transition needs to be managed , " mandelson said , but added : " i do n't regard china as a threat in the medium or long term .
i regard china as an opportunity . " disadvantaging consumers ? just like the american government , the eu commission is mainly concerned with domestic companies and jobs that are threatened by the gigantic increases in china 's exports . chinese trade minister bo xilai said that industrial countries only support free trade when it 's to their advantage .
when they see their interests being threatened , though , they reach for " protective measures . " according to the wto , such " double standards " are not allowed .
the german chamber of commerce is just one of the voices warning that a retreat to the trade restrictions previously governing the textile industry would mean sliding back into protectionism that would only serve to disadvantage consumers buying textiles on the european and us markets . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hoping for amicable chinese textile deal germany will act " in solidarity " with its european partners in the trade row with china over cheap textile imports , but berlin is hoping that an amicable deal can be reached , the german economy minister said friday .
-lrb- may 20 , 2005 -rrb- eu threatens china with wto over textiles while an eu delegation was ending a two-day visit to china , trade commissioner peter mandelson was telling the european parliament that china faced legal action if booming textile exports to the eu were n't reeled in .
-lrb- may 13 , 2005 -rrb- looming eu trade war with china ?
the eu is set to launch a probe into china 's exploding textile exports this week just as trade officials are warning that doing so could be perilous to trade structures and other industries .
-lrb- april 28 , 2005 -rrb- feedback would the eu be justified in imposing new trade restrictions on cheap chinese textiles ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.05.2005 hamburg 's harbor of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafencity 's plaza : like the rest of the project , still under construction on an island inhabited for years by old storage yards and warehouses , the city of hamburg is embarking on one of the biggest redevelopment projects in europe in recent years . in the coming years , hafencity will rise on the banks of the elbe , offering the city a rare opportunity to completely reshape its downtown area and - officials hope - bring it on par with european metropolises like barcelona and london . " compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 lawyer : us evidence clears 9/11 suspect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo jacob says his client mounir el motassadeq will be cleared the defense lawyer for a moroccan accused of involvement in the september 11 attacks in 2001 said on tuesday that new documents supplied by the us justice department would clear his client . lawyer udo jacob said the documents containing details of interviews with two suspected planners of the attacks fail to prove that the accused , mounir el motassadeq , was aware of the plot to fly planes into the world trade center and the pentagon . " motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .

" motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : france and the eu 's future chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution courting the constitution expected french ' non ' hits euro french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back europe -pipe- 24.05.2005 french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " non " campaign is still leading the political heavyweights of france 's " yes " campaign for the eu constitution have stepped up their efforts to persuade undecided voters to back the treaty .
but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .
according to an ifop poll for paris match magazine to hit the newsstands on tuesday , 54 percent of voters would say " no " , two more percentage points than in the previous survey of may 19-20 .
the " yes " vote slipped two points to 46 percent . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , left , look on as french president jacques chirac answers questionas during a joint media conference in nancy , eastern france , thursday may 19 , 2005 .
the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .

" with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .

" today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .

" if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .

" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

" if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .
the eu has set quantitative threshold values which , if overstepped , are meant to be resolved with china through informal negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , gestures during a meeting with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai speaking at the world economic forum on monday , the eu 's mandelson said that he opposes the return of quotas on chinese textiles , but added that the flood of cheap clothing shipments needed to be quelled . " that transition needs to be managed , " mandelson said , but added : " i do n't regard china as a threat in the medium or long term .
i regard china as an opportunity . " disadvantaging consumers ? just like the american government , the eu commission is mainly concerned with domestic companies and jobs that are threatened by the gigantic increases in china 's exports . chinese trade minister bo xilai said that industrial countries only support free trade when it 's to their advantage .
when they see their interests being threatened , though , they reach for " protective measures . " according to the wto , such " double standards " are not allowed .
the german chamber of commerce is just one of the voices warning that a retreat to the trade restrictions previously governing the textile industry would mean sliding back into protectionism that would only serve to disadvantage consumers buying textiles on the european and us markets . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hoping for amicable chinese textile deal germany will act " in solidarity " with its european partners in the trade row with china over cheap textile imports , but berlin is hoping that an amicable deal can be reached , the german economy minister said friday .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.05.2005 hamburg 's harbor of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafencity 's plaza : like the rest of the project , still under construction on an island inhabited for years by old storage yards and warehouses , the city of hamburg is embarking on one of the biggest redevelopment projects in europe in recent years . in the coming years , hafencity will rise on the banks of the elbe , offering the city a rare opportunity to completely reshape its downtown area and - officials hope - bring it on par with european metropolises like barcelona and london . " compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .
it is not a vital center , like in vienna or paris , " läpple said .
" the hafencity could give the entire center new impulses .

" motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

" nobody wants a crisis on our side , " said one eu diplomat ahead of the closed-door meetings .
" we want the talks to continue . " the so-called eu-3 who represent the full 25-member eu , called the talks after a series of recent threats from tehran to resume key nuclear activities , in breach of an accord to suspend them last november . gentle persuasion the eu , in contrast to the united states which suspects tehran of wanting to build nuclear bombs , is seeking to engage the islamic state , using the carrot of possible trade and other benefits to persuade it to curb its nuclear plans . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isfahan uranium conversion facility in central iran but at the same time it has warned tehran that it could be referred to the un security council - and into washington 's diplomatic line of fire - if the talks with the europeans break down . " iran should be in no doubt that any such change to the suspension would be a clear breach of the paris agreement " of last november , the eu-3 said in a letter to iran 's top negotiator , hassan rowhani . " it would bring the negotiating process to an end , " added the letter .
" the consequences beyond could only be negative for iran . " iran has warned bluntly that the talks are the " last chance " for the europeans to offer it enough of an incentive to prevent the threatened resumption of uranium enrichment activities . all eyes on europe ali agha mohammadi , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council said on monday that the iranians may not even travel to geneva if no satisfactory offer is made during talks between experts in brussels . " we would reach the conclusion that we have n't got along with them , " if they fail , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jack straw and joschka fischer will both attend the talks speaking on the eve of the talks , british foreign secretary jack straw acknowledged that the meetings in brussels and geneva will be difficult - but he said was nonetheless optimistic . " the issue before us will be to ensure that both sides stick by the agreements which we have already entered into , " straw said .
" i think -lrb- the talks -rrb- will be tough , but i think very much they will be successful . " electoral watchdog discounts reformists tension with the eu was further fueled on the eve of the talks by the disqualification by iran 's guardian council of most pro-reform candidates for june presidential polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxembourg foreign minister and president jean asselborn the council , an unelected watchdog body that vets all candidates for public office , announced on sunday that just six men out of 1,014 would-be candidates can stand to succeed incumbent reformist president mohammad khatami .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

" on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .

before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .

it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .

" these pictures i drew in secret helped me forget , they drew me into another world , the world of my art .
i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "
although not represented in the new exhibition , another artist who survived auschwitz , alfred kantor , has said of his work : " these -lrb- works -rrb- were crucial to my survival .
without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .

" public deficit problem nevertheless , growth would still not be strong enough to curb germany 's public deficit which has already exceeded eu limits for the past three years and is expected to do so again both in 2005 and 2006 . under the terms of the european growth and stability pact , euro zone countries are not allowed to run up deficits in excess of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . the german deficit ratio stood at 3.6 percent in 2004 and the government has vowed to bring it back below the 3 percent limit this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a race against the clock for hans eichel however , most experts remain skeptical and even finance minister hans eichel conceded recently that the goal was becoming increasingly difficult as growth consistently disappoints , tax revenues fall short of target and unemployment payments soar . need for further reforms the oecd predicted that the german deficit would amount to 3.5 percent of gdp again in 2005 , falling only slightly to 3.25 percent in 2006 , adding that further structural reforms were necessary to pull germany out of its current economic quagmire . " for economic performance to be raised in a durable way , reforms have to be continued and deepened within a coherent framework , " the organization wrote . but it was precisely the vast program of such reforms introduced by the current administration under schröder that has seen the popularity of the ruling social democrat spd party slump to all-time lows in the opinion polls . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .
according to an ifop poll for paris match magazine to hit the newsstands on tuesday , 54 percent of voters would say " no " , two more percentage points than in the previous survey of may 19-20 .
the " yes " vote slipped two points to 46 percent . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , left , look on as french president jacques chirac answers questionas during a joint media conference in nancy , eastern france , thursday may 19 , 2005 .
the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

" growth remains weak and heavily dependent on foreign demand , " the oecd wrote .
" but both non-residential investment and - somewhat later - household consumption are projected to pick up in the course of 2005 . " public deficit problem nevertheless , growth would still not be strong enough to curb germany 's public deficit which has already exceeded eu limits for the past three years and is expected to do so again both in 2005 and 2006 . under the terms of the european growth and stability pact , euro zone countries are not allowed to run up deficits in excess of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . the german deficit ratio stood at 3.6 percent in 2004 and the government has vowed to bring it back below the 3 percent limit this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a race against the clock for hans eichel however , most experts remain skeptical and even finance minister hans eichel conceded recently that the goal was becoming increasingly difficult as growth consistently disappoints , tax revenues fall short of target and unemployment payments soar . need for further reforms the oecd predicted that the german deficit would amount to 3.5 percent of gdp again in 2005 , falling only slightly to 3.25 percent in 2006 , adding that further structural reforms were necessary to pull germany out of its current economic quagmire . " for economic performance to be raised in a durable way , reforms have to be continued and deepened within a coherent framework , " the organization wrote . but it was precisely the vast program of such reforms introduced by the current administration under schröder that has seen the popularity of the ruling social democrat spd party slump to all-time lows in the opinion polls . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

" motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .

which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.05.2005 hamburg 's harbor of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafencity 's plaza : like the rest of the project , still under construction on an island inhabited for years by old storage yards and warehouses , the city of hamburg is embarking on one of the biggest redevelopment projects in europe in recent years . in the coming years , hafencity will rise on the banks of the elbe , offering the city a rare opportunity to completely reshape its downtown area and - officials hope - bring it on par with european metropolises like barcelona and london . " compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .
it is not a vital center , like in vienna or paris , " läpple said .
" the hafencity could give the entire center new impulses .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .
according to an ifop poll for paris match magazine to hit the newsstands on tuesday , 54 percent of voters would say " no " , two more percentage points than in the previous survey of may 19-20 .
the " yes " vote slipped two points to 46 percent . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , left , look on as french president jacques chirac answers questionas during a joint media conference in nancy , eastern france , thursday may 19 , 2005 .
the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .

which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "

her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "

which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

but the " no " camp is still ahead in the polls . supporters of the landmark eu charter from across france 's political spectrum - and from outside the country - rallied to reach some 20 percent of voters who have not yet decided how they will vote on sunday . but leaders of the " no " camp , like former socialist prime minister laurent fabius , appeared confident after the ninth opinion poll in a week indicated that they would win the referendum , saying they would not be intimidated . the latest surveys , one by ipsos polling institute and the other by the csa opinion research firm , each indicated that 53 percent of decided voters would reject the treaty .
according to an ifop poll for paris match magazine to hit the newsstands on tuesday , 54 percent of voters would say " no " , two more percentage points than in the previous survey of may 19-20 .
the " yes " vote slipped two points to 46 percent . bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , right , and polish president aleksander kwasniewski , left , look on as french president jacques chirac answers questionas during a joint media conference in nancy , eastern france , thursday may 19 , 2005 .
the leaders of france , germany and poland joined forces thursday to save the european union 's embattled constitution , meeting in eastern france less than two weeks before the widely watched french referendum . president jacques chirac , who has taken every available opportunity in recent weeks to defend the constitution , will make a last-ditch appeal to the french in a televised address on thursday night , his office announced .
aides said the french president , whose prestige is riding on the outcome of sunday 's vote , wants to " shed light on the choice of the french people " and " highlight what is at stake . " with all surveys suggesting that the referendum will be won or lost on the political left , socialist -lrb- ps -rrb- leader francois hollande appealed to his party faithful in the newspaper liberation , urging them to say " yes " to europe 's future . " until now , you have always made choices that allowed europe to move forward .
if you do n't turn out in force on may 29 , you take the risk not of creating a crisis on the right ... but a crisis in europe , " hollande said . help from spain hollande , who is campaigning for the treaty alongside chirac 's ruling center-right union for a popular movement , got a helping hand from spain 's socialist prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero . " today , all eyes in europe are on france , " zapatero said in a commentary in le figaro newspaper .
" france must approve the constitution because it is the founding mother of a united europe , because it has been the driving force behind each defining moment in the process of european construction .
france must remain present . " zapatero will be in northern france on friday , the last official day of campaigning , to give the " yes " camp a final boost . former socialist prime minister lionel jospin , seen as an elder statesman capable of winning over swing voters , will appear on national television tuesday to stump for the treaty .
the constitution , which aims to simplify the operating rules of the expanded european union , must be approved by all 25 eu member states .
so far , seven have ratified it . a rejection in a country as important as france - one of the six founding members of the bloc - would plunge the european union into political uncertainty . " if we do n't have this constitution because one country or another does n't approve it , it will be a serious political breakdown for the european union , " french foreign minister michel barnier said in brussels . dutch consider second vote meanwhile , wouter bos , head of the dutch labor party -lrb- pvda -rrb- , said the netherlands said it may consider a second referendum if dutch voters reject the european union constitution treaty in the first ballot set for june 1 .
the ballot comes three days after the french referendum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende hands out flyers to inform people about the eu constitution , the hague , the netherlands , friday , april 22 , 2005 .
if the dutch vote " no " on the treaty , " we will have to see if the netherlands stands alone , " bos told the daily algemeen dagblad , noting that 10 more european countries are expected to hold referendums .
" the netherlands could then organize a second referendum , " he said . the dutch labor party pushed for a referendum on the eu treaty , along with the parties of the center-right government coalition .
the dutch referendum in eight days is not binding for the government , but the major political parties have said their members in parliament would abide by the result if voter turnout exceeds 30 percent . britain unveils referendum bill legislation to put the eu constitution before the british people in a referendum was introduced in parliament on tuesday , along with a robust call for its adoption .
the european union bill was introduced by foreign secretary jack straw for debate and adoption in the house of commons with a call for britons to overcome their euroskeptic attitudes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : briton john bull protests in favour of keeping the pound , outside the houses of parliament in london .
" its introduction underlines our commitment to ratify this treaty by a referendum in the united kingdom , " said straw .
" i firmly believe that this treaty is good for the united kingdom and good for europe . " in a bold u-turn , prime minister tony blair announced in april last year that he would put the eu constitution to a referendum , despite opinion polls which consistently show that most britons would reject it . straw has said that the referendum would probably come in the first half of next year , following britain 's six-month turn at the rotating eu presidency which begins july 1 . " i look forward to debating the facts of this treaty in the house , dispelling the many myths around it and setting out for the british public the clear case for voting ' yes ' , " straw said . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's early election affects eu german chancellor gerhard schröder 's call for early federal elections this fall is a high-stakes gamble not only for schröder and his social democrats at home , but for the european union as a whole .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.05.2005 hamburg 's harbor of hope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hafencity 's plaza : like the rest of the project , still under construction on an island inhabited for years by old storage yards and warehouses , the city of hamburg is embarking on one of the biggest redevelopment projects in europe in recent years . in the coming years , hafencity will rise on the banks of the elbe , offering the city a rare opportunity to completely reshape its downtown area and - officials hope - bring it on par with european metropolises like barcelona and london . " compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .

" compared to other european cities , people have only a vague idea of what hamburg is about , " said jürgen bruns-berentelg , who heads the public corporation in charge of the project . " this gives us the chance to build a whole new city center , " he said .
the goal is to follow in the successful footsteps of waterfront redevelopment projects in london 's docklands and amsterdam 's east harbor .
the shift in the shipping industry in recent decades towards containerization changed the land-use needs of ports , leaving a wide swath. of former shipyards free for development . glass buildings and a masterpiece in hamburg , the harbor authorities in 1997 traded away a wrench-shaped island on the elbe river just off the traditional city center for container storage space on the other side of the channel .
in the past two years , modern buildings of glass and steel have begun to grow in the former shipyards , just a few blocks away from the deep-red brick 19th and early 20th century warehouses still inhabited by oriental carpet dealers . each is built by a different investor and different architect : hafencity planners do n't want to make the project 's fate too dependent on a handful of companies or real estate investors .
bruns-berentelg said the strategy will protect the area in uncertain economic times and ensure " that each part of the hafencity will have a different identity . " bildunterschrift : in addition to business , living and retail space , bruns-berentelg said a school , a maritime science museum and an aquarium will also be built .
the crown jewel of the project is a soaring concert hall , luxury hotel and residential complex built by star architects herzog and de meuron .
if hamburg city officials give their approval in june , the building will perch 37 meters in the air on top of a traditional warehouse building . " it will be a modern building , built on the bedrock of the past in hamburg , " bruns-berentelg said . taking its time at the moment , hafencity is not much more than a promise of things to come .
developers are busy raising the street level from 4.5 meters above sea level to 7.5 meters , in order to guard against flooding . the aerial maps show computer-rendered buildings in surprising detail , but only a quarter of the project will be finished by 2007 .
the measured pace of development is a smart strategy , said dieter läpple , a city development professor at the technical university of hamburg-harburg . " the big advantage is that it is flexible .
it is being built in steps , so that they can learn from their mistakes , " said läpple , an initial opponent of the project . hafencity has already begun learning from others .
rather than concentrating on just business space , as in the docklands , or housing , as in the redevelopment of amsterdam 's eastern docks , planners opted for the mixed-use model . the project has taken great strides since its conception , läpple said .
originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .

originally , planners had designed the development with singles and young couples in mind , something that bruns-berentelg says would n't have realized the full potential of the new city center . a new type of resident unlike berlin 's potsdamer platz , which he was involved in shaping , bruns-berentelg does n't see hafencity as a temporary respite for international jet-setters .
the plan here is to pull older residents as well as those from hamburg 's swankier suburbs into the city center , giving it a little life after dark . " we almost have to discover a whole new resident , " he said .
" you have to be a bit of a pioneer to live here .
it 's more raw here , the wind is a bit harsher . " none of that has seemed to bother claus and monika andresen .
the couple had lived on prime real estate near an inland lake before deciding to look a little further outside of the city .
they came to hafencity last summer on a lark and within months of seeing their building , bought a 104-square-meter apartment . " if you want to have a relationship to the water , which is one of hamburg 's greatest charms , and not leave the city , this is perfect , " said claus andresen , whose office at the hospitality sales agency ise is within walking distance . questions remain most of the 130 finished apartments have been bought and occupied , said hafencity officials . an additional 650 units will be built in the coming year .
by the time the project is complete , 5,500 apartments will have been built . " it 's a fantastic lifestyle down here , " said monika andresen , who heads the ad sales department at one of germany 's major sunday newspapers .
" at the same time , it 's a great investment for the future . " hafencity project planners have so far won more than 150 investors for the project , but not all the buildings have broken ground yet .
there are still questions as to when and how the necessary transit infrastructure will be built .
at the moment , a bus line snakes around the island .
a new subway line will be built by 2012 . bildunterschrift : sandtorkai " there are structural problems that still need to be solved , " läpple said . but even the former skeptic sees gold in the project , if it 's pulled off correctly . " it is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to correct the big deficits of the city center , in which a very strong monoculture exists .
it is not a vital center , like in vienna or paris , " läpple said .
" the hafencity could give the entire center new impulses .

" following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .
the eu has set quantitative threshold values which , if overstepped , are meant to be resolved with china through informal negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , gestures during a meeting with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai speaking at the world economic forum on monday , the eu 's mandelson said that he opposes the return of quotas on chinese textiles , but added that the flood of cheap clothing shipments needed to be quelled . " that transition needs to be managed , " mandelson said , but added : " i do n't regard china as a threat in the medium or long term .
i regard china as an opportunity . " disadvantaging consumers ? just like the american government , the eu commission is mainly concerned with domestic companies and jobs that are threatened by the gigantic increases in china 's exports . chinese trade minister bo xilai said that industrial countries only support free trade when it 's to their advantage .
when they see their interests being threatened , though , they reach for " protective measures . " according to the wto , such " double standards " are not allowed .
the german chamber of commerce is just one of the voices warning that a retreat to the trade restrictions previously governing the textile industry would mean sliding back into protectionism that would only serve to disadvantage consumers buying textiles on the european and us markets . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hoping for amicable chinese textile deal germany will act " in solidarity " with its european partners in the trade row with china over cheap textile imports , but berlin is hoping that an amicable deal can be reached , the german economy minister said friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 a madam chancellor for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , happy day : merkel 's mood soared as her cdu took a key state after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 a madam chancellor for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , happy day : merkel 's mood soared as her cdu took a key state after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

" nobody wants a crisis on our side , " said one eu diplomat ahead of the closed-door meetings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.05.2005 oecd predicts slower growth for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at best , germany is looking at snail-paced economic growth the organization of economic cooperation and development has slashed its growth forecasts for the german economy , predicting it would remain in breach of the eu 's budget rules both this and next year . the oecd also urged berlin to press ahead with its economic reforms following chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to bring forward the general election in a high-stakes gamble aimed at defending his ambitious program of social and labor market reforms . in its spring economic outlook , the oecd predicted that the german economy would grow by around 1.25 percent this year and 1.75 percent next year as the upswing broadens . the forecasts are drastically lower than those in the oecd 's autumn report , when the think-tank had been penciling in growth of 1.4 percent for the euro zone 's biggest economy in 2005 and 2.3 percent in 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : work tails off for many come the winter the forecasts are adjusted to take account of inflation , seasonal factors and the differing number of working days . " growth remains weak and heavily dependent on foreign demand , " the oecd wrote .
" but both non-residential investment and - somewhat later - household consumption are projected to pick up in the course of 2005 . " public deficit problem nevertheless , growth would still not be strong enough to curb germany 's public deficit which has already exceeded eu limits for the past three years and is expected to do so again both in 2005 and 2006 . under the terms of the european growth and stability pact , euro zone countries are not allowed to run up deficits in excess of 3 percent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- . the german deficit ratio stood at 3.6 percent in 2004 and the government has vowed to bring it back below the 3 percent limit this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's a race against the clock for hans eichel however , most experts remain skeptical and even finance minister hans eichel conceded recently that the goal was becoming increasingly difficult as growth consistently disappoints , tax revenues fall short of target and unemployment payments soar . need for further reforms the oecd predicted that the german deficit would amount to 3.5 percent of gdp again in 2005 , falling only slightly to 3.25 percent in 2006 , adding that further structural reforms were necessary to pull germany out of its current economic quagmire . " for economic performance to be raised in a durable way , reforms have to be continued and deepened within a coherent framework , " the organization wrote . but it was precisely the vast program of such reforms introduced by the current administration under schröder that has seen the popularity of the ruling social democrat spd party slump to all-time lows in the opinion polls . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .

" motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.05.2005 show on art in auschwitz opens in berlin großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wlodzimierz siwierski smuggled out art , taping drawings to his body the judaicum center in berlin 's new synagogue is set to open an exhibition of some 170 works by 44 concentration camp inmates entitled " art in auschwitz 1940-1945 . " on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .
a reminder of human brutality bildunterschrift : although few pieces in the collection directly depict violence or cruelty , the portraits selected convey a sense of human suffering and endurance , serving both as an eloquent reminder of human brutality and an affirmation of the creative urge , despite imminent death .
but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .
supervised artistic activity much of the work exhibited was made by polish artists .
before hitler began deporting millions of jews to auschwitz , the site had been used as a concentration camp for polish prisoners , many of whom had belonged to the polish resistance - including numerous artists .

the gas kind , of course a new study on the effects of global warming shows more than half of european plant species are at risk , especially mediterranean and alpine plants . more than half of europe 's plant species will be at threat or classified as vulnerable by 2080 as a consequence of global warming , according to a new study .
the big losers will be the northern mediterranean rim , southern portugal and southwestern spain and mountain regions , where vegetation will be badly hit by hotter weather and water stress , it warned .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tulips in northern germany " there will be a major impact .
even under the most modest scenarios which simulate extreme restraint in increase of greenhouse gas emissions , " said researcher sandra lavorel of the alpine ecology laboratory in grenoble , france , who took part in the study .
computer modeling the scientists used a high-powered computer model that provides seven scenarios for temperature change depending on how much fossil-fuel gas is released into the atmosphere .
they factored into this model the biological criteria of 1,350 species of european plants and then overlaid the result on a map to predict how europe 's vegetation might look .
" more than half of the species we studied could be vulnerable or threatened by 2080 , " the authors wrote .
" we found that risks of extinction for european plants may be large , even in moderate scenarios of climate change . "
alpine plants at risk the alps are especially at risk , as it hosts many " niche " species that over millennia have adapted to thin soil and cold and may be unable to find a home elsewhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian farmer in the alps " there are not many higher levels in the alps where a plant can find refuge , " lavorel said .
" they are not as big as the himalayas . "
northern european regions would lose the least species , but mainly because the loss of native plants would be partly compensated for by the arrival of species that migrate from the south .
the study , published in the us journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences -lrb- pnas -rrb- , was compiled by researchers from britain , france , portugal and sweden .
diverse scenarios the seven scenarios , used by the un 's intergovernmental panel on climate change , foresee a global temperature rise of between 1.8 and 3.6 celsius -lrb- 3.2 to 6.4 fahrenheit -rrb- by 2080 , depending on atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide , the principal greenhouse gas .
but this overall planetary rise in heat can vary hugely according to the location , influenced by the sea , altitude , prevailing winds and landscape .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alpine flower in addition , even a small rise in temperature could have a far-reaching impact on wildlife in dry regions such as the mediterranean coastline , where habitat is already at risk from water scarcity and forest fires .
under the gloomiest scenario - the highest temperature rise plus the projection that no species would be able to migrate - 22 percent of the species would become critically endangered and 2 percent would become extinct by 2080 .
under the most optimist scenario - the lowest temperature rise plus the projection that all species could migrate - 67 percent of species would be at low risk . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de kyoto takes effect but unep worries the head of the kenya-based un environment program -lrb- unep -rrb- warned wednesday that the effects of climate change may lead to earth " spinning out of control " and urged immediate steps to halt global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 lawyer : us evidence clears 9/11 suspect großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : udo jacob says his client mounir el motassadeq will be cleared the defense lawyer for a moroccan accused of involvement in the september 11 attacks in 2001 said on tuesday that new documents supplied by the us justice department would clear his client . lawyer udo jacob said the documents containing details of interviews with two suspected planners of the attacks fail to prove that the accused , mounir el motassadeq , was aware of the plot to fly planes into the world trade center and the pentagon . " motassadeq must now be cleared of all charges , " jacob said outside the courtroom in the northern city of hamburg .
the long-awaited documents supplied by the us justice department contain summaries of the interrogations of ramzi binalshibh , whom us authorities believe helped mastermind the attacks which killed nearly 3,000 people . binalshibh said that mohammed atta , the egyptian leader of the suicide pilots , only created his group in germany , known as the " hamburg cell , " after 2000 .
that contradicts the prosecution 's case that atta formed the group in 1999 . prosecuting attorney matthias krauss dismissed binalshibh 's testimony .
" it stands in contradiction to numerous statements that we have found , " he said .
" the question is whether you believe binalshibh . " he said he no longer asserted that the details of the september 11 attacks were planned in hamburg in 1999 , however , he remained convinced the hamburg cell had decided to use violence against western targets by then .
" we have no reason to depart from this conclusion , " he said . krauß also pointed out that the us documents said binalshibh " may have been intentionally withholding information and employing counter-interrogation techniques " . motassadeq not named bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ramzi binalshibh binalshibh did not name motassadeq as a member of the cell and said they did not inform him of their plans .
motassadeq , 31 , has admitted knowing atta , but denies having any knowledge of the plot to attack new york and washington . the evidence from the united states also concerns interviews with mohamed ould slahi , a mauritanian national who was arrested in senegal in january 2000 on suspicion of planning other attacks .
the documents were rumored to have contained evidence from another alleged planner of the september 11 attacks , khalid sheikh mohammed , but that was not the case .
all three men remain in us custody . the defense said that if the evidence had been obtained through torture , it would not be admissible in a german court .
federal prosecutors said however they believed there was enough evidence to convict motassadeq for membership of a terrorist group . motassadeq was jailed by a german court for 15 years in february 2003 for his role in the attacks , but in march 2004 a new trial was ordered because us authorities refused to allow binalshibh and sheikh mohammed to testify . the hamburg court had been waiting several months for the information from the united states .
washington has informed berlin that it will not supply any further documents for use in motassadeq 's trial . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the trouble with nailing terror suspects the domestic intelligence agency , the office for the protection of the constitution , presented its annual report in berlin tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.05.2005 taxing chinese textiles in the eu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese exports of underwear to the us have tripled since january china says it will raise taxes on a range of textile exports to calm an ongoing trade dispute with europe and the united states - a reaction to new restrictions imposed by the us and threats by the eu to do the same . free trade on the previously strictly regulated textile and clothing market lasted only four and a half months before the us re-imposed quotas on several categories of chinese textile imports and the eu opened an investigation which could end with similar results . the eu on monday actually moved towards imposing limits on some types of surging chinese textiles after member states voted in favor of opening formal negotiations with beijing . the eu 's textile committee approved a proposal by eu trade commissioner peter mandelson to launch formal talks with china on a surge in exports of t-shirts and flax yarn . " following the committee 's approval , the decision to launch formal consultation should be taken by the commission on wednesday , " the commission said in a statement . as it turned out , chinese textile and clothing manufacturers were well-prepared for the expiration of the 30-year-old system that limited the amount of textiles that could be imported from one country . for 126 product categories covering 60 percent of european and american textile and clothing imports , the markets became freely accessible this past january .
the chinese took advantage of this , to great success .
since january , exports to the us and european markets grew in leaps and bounds . in europe for example , imports of knitwear grew 500 percent ; for men 's pants , 900 percent .
exports of underwear to the us tripled , while exports of cotton pants grew 15-fold .
according to information from the us government , 18 factories closed in the us as a result , and more than 16,000 jobs were lost . eu countries worried bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a chinese worker pieces a garment together at her sewing machine at a wholesale garment factory in beijing leading the european coalition for tighter restrictions on textile imports from china are italy , france , spain , portugal and greece .
reacting to the demands , the eu commission has opened an investigation , and announced that it would introduce restrictions on imports of t-shirts and flax yarn from china - measures some analysts said were unfair . " the point of the wto agreement was to simply phase out the quotas , so that we would have free trade , " said dean spinanger from the kiel institute for world economics .
" if one country is better than another country and for that reason can export more , that 's not a crime .
just the opposite - all countries would like to be in that position . " germany 's economics minister , wolfgang clement , is against restricting free trade in principle .
he does n't hide the fact that germany 's textile industry prepared itself for the liberalization of trade agreements by reducing its capacity , closing several companies and shedding thousands of jobs . built into the contract governing the end of quota restrictions on the textiles sector are transition regulations valid until 2008 .
according to these regulations , chinese textile exports are permitted to grow by 7.5 percent annually .
the eu has set quantitative threshold values which , if overstepped , are meant to be resolved with china through informal negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu trade commissioner peter mandelson , right , gestures during a meeting with chinese minister of commerce bo xilai speaking at the world economic forum on monday , the eu 's mandelson said that he opposes the return of quotas on chinese textiles , but added that the flood of cheap clothing shipments needed to be quelled . " that transition needs to be managed , " mandelson said , but added : " i do n't regard china as a threat in the medium or long term .
i regard china as an opportunity . " disadvantaging consumers ? just like the american government , the eu commission is mainly concerned with domestic companies and jobs that are threatened by the gigantic increases in china 's exports . chinese trade minister bo xilai said that industrial countries only support free trade when it 's to their advantage .
when they see their interests being threatened , though , they reach for " protective measures . " according to the wto , such " double standards " are not allowed .
the german chamber of commerce is just one of the voices warning that a retreat to the trade restrictions previously governing the textile industry would mean sliding back into protectionism that would only serve to disadvantage consumers buying textiles on the european and us markets . karl zawadzky -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hoping for amicable chinese textile deal germany will act " in solidarity " with its european partners in the trade row with china over cheap textile imports , but berlin is hoping that an amicable deal can be reached , the german economy minister said friday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.05.2005 a madam chancellor for germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oh , happy day : merkel 's mood soared as her cdu took a key state after years of working toward her goal , angela merkel is just a technicality away from running for germany 's highest office .
which begs the question : is germany ready for a woman chancellor ? a reporter recently asked angela merkel , " are you tough ? "
the 50-year-old politician replied , " let 's just say i 'm persistent . "
and her persistence has paid off .
her party , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , just won a glaring victory in the state of north rhine-westphalia , which was widely seen as a plebiscite on the current national social democrat government .
now , few doubts remain that she will be put forward as the candidate for chancellor , in snap elections to be held as soon as this fall .
bildunterschrift : angela merkel answering journalists ' questions as the question of her candidacy becomes more immediate , pundits have begun wondering if merkel is germany 's answer to margaret thatcher .
known as the iron lady , thatcher was england 's first female head of state , and a decidedly conservative one at that .
rocky times merkel is basically a careful person - sometimes even skeptical or distrustful .
that is n't likely to change .
while she may be at the height of her powers right now , the past five months have proved that her caution was indeed called for .
as recently as february , prior to the surprise victory of her party in the northern state of schleswig-holstein , she had her back pinned tightly against the wall .
at the time , many of those in the cdu leadership took a typical " bystander " attitude , waiting to see what would happen to " madame chairwoman . "
and merkel herself felt left in the lurch , having wasted the entire second half of 2004 in internal fighting with the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the csu -lrb- christian socialists -rrb- , over plans for a much disputed health-care reform package .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with csu chief edmund stoiber her response ?
to prove her full dedication to the party .
she upended her appointment calendar and increased her stumping appearances in the north .
" i do n't want to leave myself open to reproach , " she explained , even as some were predicting merkel would soon be singing a swan song .
dedication paid off in the end , the cdu leader was graced with the most important quality a politician can have , after competence and persistence : luck .
the social democrat prime minister of schleswig holstein , heide simonis , was unseated by local cdu leader peter harry carstensen in an upset decision .
the public was stunned by new jobless figures of five million .
the " visa affair " that rocked foreign minister joschka fischer added to the uncertainty of spd voters .
the cdu won in the north , against all prognoses , thus effectively ending the discussion over merkel 's ability to lead her party .
merkel now looks set to be germany 's first-ever female candidate for chancellor .
but then , she is no stranger to " firsts . "
since 2000 , she has been the first female cdu chairwoman , as well as the first woman at the head of the parliamentary party .
not your typical cdu member merkel 's biography - she is a divorced protestant , from eastern germany , with no children - is n't one typically associated with the cdu .
rather , the party is known for its conservative catholic roots , and for being dominated by men from the western part of germany .
yet she was elected to the party chairmanship in 2000 , amid a donation scandal .
and in at the next party congress in 2004 , in düsseldorf , she tried to bring her history into harmony with that of the party , and succeeded .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz had to go .
from the beginning , the grass roots cdu members were more in favor than the party functionaries , of taking a chance on the phd physicist from the east .
merkel had to defend herself against numerous opponents .
it was often difficult and time-consuming , but one by one , she found her supporters and close aides .
her image suffered as a result .
but after she ousted friedrich merz -lrb- photo -rrb- as parliamentary party chairman in 2002 , she went on the offensive .
unified vision needed during the iraq conflict , merkel separated herself from the red-green leadership in favor of a pro-american course .
domestically , she wants to take a leading role in reforms .
thus far , she has waged a bitter battle with the csu over health care reform .
she survived it , but her plan came out severely weakened .
ahead of the snap elections that everyone professes to support , there is one thing merkel and other cdu-csu leaders , will not say .
at least not out loud .
and that is , due to the rushed election , the cdu and csu have a platform dilemma .
the need to settle certain political issues and platforms prior to an election , so that they will not become problems during a cdu-csu reign , has not been solved .
small signs of reform can be seen on questions of taxes and nursing care insurance .
but a definitive political platform is still lacking for the woman who may just become the first female chancellor of germany . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de decision time for germany 's " iron lady " opposition leader angela merkel has her work cut out for her at a party meeting starting on monday .

" on tuesday evening , chancellor gerhard schröder and the polish ambassador andrzej byrt will be attending the opening of a show put together by the state museum auschwitz-birkenau in oswiecim , which owns a collection of some 1470 previously unseen still-lifes , landscapes , caricatures and portraits culled from its collection of art created in the auschwitz extermination camp .
" art in auschwitz 1940-1945 " marks the first time a show has foregrounded art from concentration camps rather than featuring it within the margins of a broader examination of german history - the standard approach towards holocaust exhibitions over the last sixty years .

but they also work as autonomous , highly expressive works of art .
critics have said that the only authentic response to the holocaust is silence .
similarly , these portraits of people devoid of hope , sketches of starving crowds waiting to be deported , desolate children and executions are images that no pencil , pen or brush should ever have had to commit to paper or canvas .
but these pictures are testimonies to events - reflections of a time and place .

it became a highly desirable work assignment for prisoners , providing them with art supplies and affording them the opportunity to make more private images .

i was aware that drawing was punished with death and it was not that i was brave , more that i simply ignored the risk , because i could not resist creating my own world . "

without this extra nourishment , i could not have endured the months of hard labor . "
his secret artistic activity had a crucial psychological purpose .
" my commitment to drawing came out of a deep instinct of self-preservation and undoubtedly helped me to deny the unimaginable horrors of that time .

lewis 's at aberdare in the south wales valleys has been closed for business for decades but the shop remains completely intact .
experts are now conserving the salon to re-erect at the museum of welsh life in st fagans near cardiff .
they describe the sugar pink and baby blue salon as a " time capsule " .
gerallt nash , the head of historic buildings at the museum , said that the salon offers a snapshot of women 's lives , style and growing independence at the cusp of the 1960s .
the salon looks as it did on the day it closed he said that the salon , which has been empty for decades , was donated to the museum by the family who own it .
the business was started by john lewis from cwmdare in the 1930s .
as a 17-years-old , he moved the business to gadlys , aberdare , and the business expanded as his children thomas , margaret olive and sarah mary -lrb- mari -rrb- took up the scissors .
father and son ran the barbers while mari and olive ran the hairdressing salon with the help of two apprentices .
but the salon closed with the sudden death of thomas in 1990 .
his two sisters recently passed away .
the museum is now looking for a setting for the building mr nash said that most of the museum 's buildings told stories of male-dominated occupations but the hairdressing salon would " look at women 's growing independence and working lives " .
he said : " the iconic styles of the 1950s and early 60s can be very clearly seen in the salon whilst the barber still has that very distinct feel and smell of testosterone , brylcreem and a little something for the weekend ! "
he said workers from the museum were in the process of dismantling the salon piece by piece to rebuilt at the site in st fagans .
" it 's a time capsule - it is a complete hairdressing salon which has survived in its original appearance from the 1950s , " he said .
" it 's an aspect of everyday life , which at the moment we are not covering .
" and it gives us an opportunity to fill in part of the jigsaw of how people lived in the past - people 's daily lives , " he added .
mr nash is now looking for the perfect setting for the salon .
" what we need now is a small terrace of shops to accommodate it , and some of the other interiors that we have in store , such as an italian café . "

richard x started his career in the underground music scene , then left it behind to write hits for the sugababes and rachel stevens .
his synthesised , grungy pop music is inspired by the bands he listened to while growing up in the north of england , such as the human league and kraftwerk .
richard x says he is on a crusade to reinvent pop music , and he is going to do it by making records that are " deliberately unplayable " .
for example , he describes his biggest hit of last year , the rachel stevens single some girls , as " rough as old boots . "
" not rachel herself , " he adds hastily , " just the track and the production " .
despite his best efforts , radio stations are not shying away from richard x 's music - he is the man behind hits for the sugababes , kelis and liberty x , while bands like new order have called on him for remixes .
richard x 's first releases were " bootlegs " - illegal , under the counter remixes which combined two existing records to make an entirely new song .
the idea , he explains , was " escaping from that world of formatting - which the dj culture and club culture relies on so much .
" they were supposed to be the future of pop music . "
strangely enough , that is exactly what they became .
freak like me island records , in particular , were looking for a song to drive the sugababes out of a cul-de-sac of formulaic pop .
" the a & r people had heard one of my records -lsb- freak like me -rsb- and for some reason they thought ' wow , that could be great ' .
" and i was very keen to do it as long as it remained what it was .
it was raw , it was against the grain and it was still pop music . "
" as long as you had the sugababes around at your house , you could recreate that record " richard x richard x got his way , and recorded a number one single on the cheap in his flat in tooting .
he says : " when we made the sugababes thing there was a loop , some handclaps , the sugababes and a semi-broken synthesiser . "
" you could probably forget about the synth and as long as you had the sugababes around at your house , you could recreate that record . "
making a splash the single was a massive hit , launching both richard x and the sugababes into the mainstream .
his next project was an album , x factor volume one , which he describes as " modern , alternative , future-pop " .
it is a stunning collection of songs , full of sugar-coated hooks and richard 's trademark smashed-up samples .
in other words , it is his manifesto for the future of pop .
" i was trying to really hammer home the point , very unsubtly , on the album , " he says .
it acted as a calling card , too .
the great and the good all want some of the x-factor , from p diddy to girls aloud . "
each track has to stand alone " richard x " i 'm in a bit of a strange position , " he reflects , " people send me so much different stuff , just because there 's a few different angles , i suppose , to what i do . "
how does he decide who to work with ?
" it 's very much who tickles my fancy , " he says , although he 's been lucky to meet a couple of " kindred spirits " - including kelis and m.i.a. quality control but no matter with whom he collaborates , however , richard x has one guiding principle .
" each track has to stand alone .
the song , the production and everything together .
" my reference point is always imagining finding it on a seven-inch -lsb- single -rsb- in a second hand shop when you were younger . "
treating every song as a potential single is not common practice in the music industry .
most professional songwriters try to build up a pool of work to be used as album tracks and b-sides .
" i can see how you can get into that world , " richard x says .
" -lsb- but -rsb- i do n't have that .
i just throw things away .
hence why i do n't seem to be as productive as other people . "
such perfectionism places richard x defiantly outside the mainstream , but that is where he is most comfortable .
he prefers to remain enigmatic - refusing to reveal his age or his real name .
" i do n't think that 's particularly important , " he says , " unless they need to etch it into the statues at the novellos " .
