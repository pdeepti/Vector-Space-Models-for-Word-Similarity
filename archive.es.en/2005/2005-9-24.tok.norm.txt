program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .

that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .

so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority .

currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .
but we have to encourage professionals with higher incomes to have babies , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other changes include a doubling of the tax credit for families that hire home-help for children under six , and the extension of discounts available for families with three or more children . france better off than eu counterparts france already has a comprehensive array of incentives for child-bearing , including generous child allowances and a calibrated income tax system that means that families with more children pay less . parents with three or more children can also get " large family " cards that bring discounts on public transport .
these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy .

" i think even more people will be out today because of the attacks on london , on muslims and events in basra , " said lehal . " the attacks prove a point we 've long been making : the invasion and illegal occupation of iraq have made us a major terrorist target .
the only people who ca n't see that are in our government . " activist bianca jagger , musician brian eno , labour member of parliament tony benn and the parents of british soldiers killed in iraq were all due to address marchers . protests in washington too one soldier 's mother , sue smith , was set to take a letter to blair 's office at downing street urging the withdrawal of troops from iraq . another , rose gentle from scotland , flew to washington where she will march side by side with cindy sheehan , a killed american soldier 's mother who has come to symbolize the us 's anti-war movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demonstrators are buoyed by opinion polls that show a growing majority disapprove of bush 's handling of the war and question the rationale for us military action . " it seems to be playing out the way it did with vietnam .
as time goes on , more and more people begin to have doubts , " said frank nicosia , a history professor who traveled by bus with his wife from vermont to attend the march . " few people judge whether it 's right or wrong , smart or stupid .
they only ask does it effect me or does n't it ?

what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .

maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .
heads of government in germany are not yet established according to the rules of fist fights . ute thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .

but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .

" the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy .

of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .
so what are they capable of this season ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg still has confidence in his former team effenberg proved wrong stefan effenberg -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 2001 champions league winner with bayern , said he believes the current season is going to be an even bigger procession .
though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg . " we are not title contenders , " declared hamburg coach thomas doll .
" bayern are top and there on merit . " hamburg are second and just one point behind the tabletoppers from munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen won the german title in 2004 still plenty to play for bremen , only two points behind in third , stole the crown from bayern in 2004 but did not help their title tilt this season by selling their french defensive star valerien ismael to bayern for eight million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- . even after one loss , it is still hard to see who can even challenge bayern let alone finish above them but manager felix magath insists there is still some spice left in the bundesliga . " i do not think the league is threatening to become boring , " vowed magath " the season still has a long way to go and it will still be difficult for us . " german football neutrals will hope so , but bayern fans are content with letting the dominance continue . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin beats cologne in historic win in their first real test of the season , bayern munich suffered their first loss in 15 games in hamburg saturday , putting some spice back into the bundesliga title race .

" i think even more people will be out today because of the attacks on london , on muslims and events in basra , " said lehal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold .

" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators .

" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .
so what are they capable of this season ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg still has confidence in his former team effenberg proved wrong stefan effenberg -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 2001 champions league winner with bayern , said he believes the current season is going to be an even bigger procession .
though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg . " we are not title contenders , " declared hamburg coach thomas doll .
" bayern are top and there on merit . " hamburg are second and just one point behind the tabletoppers from munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen won the german title in 2004 still plenty to play for bremen , only two points behind in third , stole the crown from bayern in 2004 but did not help their title tilt this season by selling their french defensive star valerien ismael to bayern for eight million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- . even after one loss , it is still hard to see who can even challenge bayern let alone finish above them but manager felix magath insists there is still some spice left in the bundesliga . " i do not think the league is threatening to become boring , " vowed magath " the season still has a long way to go and it will still be difficult for us . " german football neutrals will hope so , but bayern fans are content with letting the dominance continue . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin beats cologne in historic win in their first real test of the season , bayern munich suffered their first loss in 15 games in hamburg saturday , putting some spice back into the bundesliga title race .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .
heads of government in germany are not yet established according to the rules of fist fights . ute thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely .

" today coincides with the demonstration in washington dc and is also the eve of the labour party annual conference , " which prime minister tony blair will attend in the southern city of brighton , stop the war spokesman viven lehal told afp . bildunterschrift : the demonstrators were to set off from the houses of parliament around noon -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- , arriving at hyde park two hours later where the rally was to continue .
british anti-war campaigners have been calling relentlessly for the return of the 8,500 british troops deployed as part of the us-led forces in iraq . " we want to withdraw the troops from iraq .
clearly what happened in basra this week shows that british troops are n't helping there , they make the situation worse , " lehal told afp . renewed violence in iraq the past week saw an upsurge of tensions around the southern iraqi city of basra , where many of britain 's troops in the country are based . bildunterschrift : iraqis run from the area as a british warrior fighting vehicle burns in basra , southeast of baghdad british troops stormed an iraqi police station after two british undercover soldiers were arrested by the police and then kidnapped by a shiite militia .

" i think even more people will be out today because of the attacks on london , on muslims and events in basra , " said lehal . " the attacks prove a point we 've long been making : the invasion and illegal occupation of iraq have made us a major terrorist target .
the only people who ca n't see that are in our government . " activist bianca jagger , musician brian eno , labour member of parliament tony benn and the parents of british soldiers killed in iraq were all due to address marchers . protests in washington too one soldier 's mother , sue smith , was set to take a letter to blair 's office at downing street urging the withdrawal of troops from iraq . another , rose gentle from scotland , flew to washington where she will march side by side with cindy sheehan , a killed american soldier 's mother who has come to symbolize the us 's anti-war movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demonstrators are buoyed by opinion polls that show a growing majority disapprove of bush 's handling of the war and question the rationale for us military action . " it seems to be playing out the way it did with vietnam .
as time goes on , more and more people begin to have doubts , " said frank nicosia , a history professor who traveled by bus with his wife from vermont to attend the march . " few people judge whether it 's right or wrong , smart or stupid .
they only ask does it effect me or does n't it ?
that 's beginning to happen now .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .

" the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority . " under the proposals , a parent who takes time off from work for a third child will have the option of a boosted monthly pay-out of 750 euros -lrb- $ 915 -rrb- for one year .
currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .
but we have to encourage professionals with higher incomes to have babies , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other changes include a doubling of the tax credit for families that hire home-help for children under six , and the extension of discounts available for families with three or more children . france better off than eu counterparts france already has a comprehensive array of incentives for child-bearing , including generous child allowances and a calibrated income tax system that means that families with more children pay less . parents with three or more children can also get " large family " cards that bring discounts on public transport .
these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy . " nonetheless the trend is not satisfactory , " it said , largely because more french women are waiting longer to have their first child . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with some 80.7 percent of women aged between 25 and 49 participating in the workforce , france has one of the highest rates of working women in europe .
but the report said that this is not incompatible with a high birth rate and that - with the proper policies - the two can go hand-in-hand . sociologist sullerot says she ’ d like to see further incentives for young mothers in the future . " my dream is that every mother will have a card that guarantees certain rights , like the right to vocational training , and the right to a better pension depending on the number of children they have , " she said . falling birth rates worries europe falling birth rates are a growing worry across the eu , with demographers predicting that large-scale immigration will be necessary in many countries in order to sustain the benefits enjoyed by a steadily aging population . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .

so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .

though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg .

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .
so what are they capable of this season ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg still has confidence in his former team effenberg proved wrong stefan effenberg -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 2001 champions league winner with bayern , said he believes the current season is going to be an even bigger procession .
though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg . " we are not title contenders , " declared hamburg coach thomas doll .
" bayern are top and there on merit . " hamburg are second and just one point behind the tabletoppers from munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen won the german title in 2004 still plenty to play for bremen , only two points behind in third , stole the crown from bayern in 2004 but did not help their title tilt this season by selling their french defensive star valerien ismael to bayern for eight million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- . even after one loss , it is still hard to see who can even challenge bayern let alone finish above them but manager felix magath insists there is still some spice left in the bundesliga . " i do not think the league is threatening to become boring , " vowed magath " the season still has a long way to go and it will still be difficult for us . " german football neutrals will hope so , but bayern fans are content with letting the dominance continue . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin beats cologne in historic win in their first real test of the season , bayern munich suffered their first loss in 15 games in hamburg saturday , putting some spice back into the bundesliga title race .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .
so what are they capable of this season ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg still has confidence in his former team effenberg proved wrong stefan effenberg -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 2001 champions league winner with bayern , said he believes the current season is going to be an even bigger procession .
though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg . " we are not title contenders , " declared hamburg coach thomas doll .
" bayern are top and there on merit . " hamburg are second and just one point behind the tabletoppers from munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen won the german title in 2004 still plenty to play for bremen , only two points behind in third , stole the crown from bayern in 2004 but did not help their title tilt this season by selling their french defensive star valerien ismael to bayern for eight million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- . even after one loss , it is still hard to see who can even challenge bayern let alone finish above them but manager felix magath insists there is still some spice left in the bundesliga . " i do not think the league is threatening to become boring , " vowed magath " the season still has a long way to go and it will still be difficult for us .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely .
-lrb- sept .
23 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : do n't underestimate merkel in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority . " under the proposals , a parent who takes time off from work for a third child will have the option of a boosted monthly pay-out of 750 euros -lrb- $ 915 -rrb- for one year .
currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .

these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy . " nonetheless the trend is not satisfactory , " it said , largely because more french women are waiting longer to have their first child . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with some 80.7 percent of women aged between 25 and 49 participating in the workforce , france has one of the highest rates of working women in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2005 opinion : do n't underestimate merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angie 's persistence and level-headedness take her to the top ?
in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .
heads of government in germany are not yet established according to the rules of fist fights . ute thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely .
-lrb- sept .
23 , 2005 -rrb- finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .
" kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different .

" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators .

" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold .

" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators .

" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2005 opinion : do n't underestimate merkel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will angie 's persistence and level-headedness take her to the top ?
in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .
heads of government in germany are not yet established according to the rules of fist fights . ute thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely .
-lrb- sept .
23 , 2005 -rrb- finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .
" kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .

this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold .

" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators .

" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors . " this is the biggest contract in the history of our company and it will be the biggest challenge , " käfer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium will attract fans from all classes .
the better-situated will be treated like royalty a comment not to be taken lightly considering that the catering company has its own tent at the oktoberfest in munich .
yet , the oktoberfest , for all of its charming qualities , does not attract the wealthy in large numbers .
the world cup makes for a one-time opportunity for companies , particularly german ones , to show just how much they appreciate their big customers .
quality food is part of it , yet it wo n't be easy for käfer . " our workers have to be here two hours before work begins because of the extensive security checks , " he said .
" and only one company can deliver to the grounds , and that can happen 10 hours before a match at the latest .

according to the 58-year-old , cramming too many matches into a season is to blame for soccer 's downfall .
" for years i 've been pushing for 60 or an absolute maximum of 65 matches per season , that 's something we 're very far away from . "
brazil is cruyff 's favorite as far as june 's world cup is concerned , but he added no one should rule the hosts out .
" germany is always strong in short tournaments like the world cup , " he said .

the one-time star midfielder went on to call great matches in the overly-defensive game a " media event . "
according to the 58-year-old , cramming too many matches into a season is to blame for soccer 's downfall .
" for years i 've been pushing for 60 or an absolute maximum of 65 matches per season , that 's something we 're very far away from . "
brazil is cruyff 's favorite as far as june 's world cup is concerned , but he added no one should rule the hosts out .
" germany is always strong in short tournaments like the world cup , " he said .
the number of foreign players in the bundesliga hurts germany 's chances on the international stage , cruyff said .
" clubs should be obligated to have five or six native players in every game , " he said . dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely .

23 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : do n't underestimate merkel in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .

for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .

so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

protest rallies were also planned in rome , paris , madrid , copenhagen , oslo and helsinki , to coincide with a similar march in washington . the stop the war coalition , which organized the london rally jointly with the campaign for nuclear disarmament and the muslim association of britain , said it expected at least 100,000 people to take part . " today coincides with the demonstration in washington dc and is also the eve of the labour party annual conference , " which prime minister tony blair will attend in the southern city of brighton , stop the war spokesman viven lehal told afp . bildunterschrift : the demonstrators were to set off from the houses of parliament around noon -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- , arriving at hyde park two hours later where the rally was to continue .
british anti-war campaigners have been calling relentlessly for the return of the 8,500 british troops deployed as part of the us-led forces in iraq . " we want to withdraw the troops from iraq .
clearly what happened in basra this week shows that british troops are n't helping there , they make the situation worse , " lehal told afp . renewed violence in iraq the past week saw an upsurge of tensions around the southern iraqi city of basra , where many of britain 's troops in the country are based . bildunterschrift : iraqis run from the area as a british warrior fighting vehicle burns in basra , southeast of baghdad british troops stormed an iraqi police station after two british undercover soldiers were arrested by the police and then kidnapped by a shiite militia .
authorities in basra have been refusing to engage with british troops following the incident . saturday 's protest was also called in protest at counter-terrorism measures proposed by the government in the wake of the london bombings in july , and perceived by critics as a threat to civil liberties - and to mark concern at a sharp rise in racist incidents in the wake of the bombings , lehal said . the last such demonstration took place on march 19 when organizers claimed 110,000 people took to the streets although police estimated the figure to be closer to 45,000 . " i think even more people will be out today because of the attacks on london , on muslims and events in basra , " said lehal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority .

currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .

these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy . " nonetheless the trend is not satisfactory , " it said , largely because more french women are waiting longer to have their first child . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with some 80.7 percent of women aged between 25 and 49 participating in the workforce , france has one of the highest rates of working women in europe .
but the report said that this is not incompatible with a high birth rate and that - with the proper policies - the two can go hand-in-hand . sociologist sullerot says she ’ d like to see further incentives for young mothers in the future . " my dream is that every mother will have a card that guarantees certain rights , like the right to vocational training , and the right to a better pension depending on the number of children they have , " she said . falling birth rates worries europe falling birth rates are a growing worry across the eu , with demographers predicting that large-scale immigration will be necessary in many countries in order to sustain the benefits enjoyed by a steadily aging population . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

" from a technical point of view , soccer has been going downhill for years , " he said in an interview with fifa magazine .
the one-time star midfielder went on to call great matches in the overly-defensive game a " media event . "
according to the 58-year-old , cramming too many matches into a season is to blame for soccer 's downfall .
" for years i 've been pushing for 60 or an absolute maximum of 65 matches per season , that 's something we 're very far away from . "
brazil is cruyff 's favorite as far as june 's world cup is concerned , but he added no one should rule the hosts out .
" germany is always strong in short tournaments like the world cup , " he said .
the number of foreign players in the bundesliga hurts germany 's chances on the international stage , cruyff said .
" clubs should be obligated to have five or six native players in every game , " he said . dw-world.de new crop of brazilians in bundesliga before the transfer window came to a close on aug .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2005 france moves to encourage large families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a third pram with baby would complete the happy picture already boasting one of the highest birth rates in the eu , france has unveiled measures to spur women to have more children .
they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority . " under the proposals , a parent who takes time off from work for a third child will have the option of a boosted monthly pay-out of 750 euros -lrb- $ 915 -rrb- for one year .
currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .
but we have to encourage professionals with higher incomes to have babies , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other changes include a doubling of the tax credit for families that hire home-help for children under six , and the extension of discounts available for families with three or more children . france better off than eu counterparts france already has a comprehensive array of incentives for child-bearing , including generous child allowances and a calibrated income tax system that means that families with more children pay less . parents with three or more children can also get " large family " cards that bring discounts on public transport .
these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy . " nonetheless the trend is not satisfactory , " it said , largely because more french women are waiting longer to have their first child . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with some 80.7 percent of women aged between 25 and 49 participating in the workforce , france has one of the highest rates of working women in europe .
but the report said that this is not incompatible with a high birth rate and that - with the proper policies - the two can go hand-in-hand . sociologist sullerot says she ’ d like to see further incentives for young mothers in the future . " my dream is that every mother will have a card that guarantees certain rights , like the right to vocational training , and the right to a better pension depending on the number of children they have , " she said . falling birth rates worries europe falling birth rates are a growing worry across the eu , with demographers predicting that large-scale immigration will be necessary in many countries in order to sustain the benefits enjoyed by a steadily aging population . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

" for years i 've been pushing for 60 or an absolute maximum of 65 matches per season , that 's something we 're very far away from . "
brazil is cruyff 's favorite as far as june 's world cup is concerned , but he added no one should rule the hosts out .
" germany is always strong in short tournaments like the world cup , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005/2006 bundesliga season bayern top as flying dutchman takes off is the bundesliga too weak ? ballack header saves bayern record bremen stick with record breaking bayern sports -pipe- 24.09.2005 bayern dominance creates boringliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich celebrating has nearly become a given in the bundesliga even after a loss to hamburg , the shine on bayern munich 's record has hardly been smudged .
munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .
so what are they capable of this season ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg still has confidence in his former team effenberg proved wrong stefan effenberg -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 2001 champions league winner with bayern , said he believes the current season is going to be an even bigger procession .
though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .
heads of government in germany are not yet established according to the rules of fist fights . ute thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely .
-lrb- sept .
23 , 2005 -rrb- finding the will to compromise in germany read dw-world 's dossier on the search for a new german government .
" kohl 's girl " makes good angela merkel 's quiet but determined rise to the top of german politics shows that it 's not necessarily a disadvantage to be underestimated by political opponents or inner-party rivals .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors . " this is the biggest contract in the history of our company and it will be the biggest challenge , " käfer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium will attract fans from all classes .
the better-situated will be treated like royalty a comment not to be taken lightly considering that the catering company has its own tent at the oktoberfest in munich .
yet , the oktoberfest , for all of its charming qualities , does not attract the wealthy in large numbers .
the world cup makes for a one-time opportunity for companies , particularly german ones , to show just how much they appreciate their big customers .
quality food is part of it , yet it wo n't be easy for käfer . " our workers have to be here two hours before work begins because of the extensive security checks , " he said .
" and only one company can deliver to the grounds , and that can happen 10 hours before a match at the latest .

protest rallies were also planned in rome , paris , madrid , copenhagen , oslo and helsinki , to coincide with a similar march in washington . the stop the war coalition , which organized the london rally jointly with the campaign for nuclear disarmament and the muslim association of britain , said it expected at least 100,000 people to take part . " today coincides with the demonstration in washington dc and is also the eve of the labour party annual conference , " which prime minister tony blair will attend in the southern city of brighton , stop the war spokesman viven lehal told afp . bildunterschrift : the demonstrators were to set off from the houses of parliament around noon -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- , arriving at hyde park two hours later where the rally was to continue .
british anti-war campaigners have been calling relentlessly for the return of the 8,500 british troops deployed as part of the us-led forces in iraq . " we want to withdraw the troops from iraq .
clearly what happened in basra this week shows that british troops are n't helping there , they make the situation worse , " lehal told afp . renewed violence in iraq the past week saw an upsurge of tensions around the southern iraqi city of basra , where many of britain 's troops in the country are based . bildunterschrift : iraqis run from the area as a british warrior fighting vehicle burns in basra , southeast of baghdad british troops stormed an iraqi police station after two british undercover soldiers were arrested by the police and then kidnapped by a shiite militia .
authorities in basra have been refusing to engage with british troops following the incident . saturday 's protest was also called in protest at counter-terrorism measures proposed by the government in the wake of the london bombings in july , and perceived by critics as a threat to civil liberties - and to mark concern at a sharp rise in racist incidents in the wake of the bombings , lehal said . the last such demonstration took place on march 19 when organizers claimed 110,000 people took to the streets although police estimated the figure to be closer to 45,000 . " i think even more people will be out today because of the attacks on london , on muslims and events in basra , " said lehal . " the attacks prove a point we 've long been making : the invasion and illegal occupation of iraq have made us a major terrorist target .
the only people who ca n't see that are in our government . " activist bianca jagger , musician brian eno , labour member of parliament tony benn and the parents of british soldiers killed in iraq were all due to address marchers . protests in washington too one soldier 's mother , sue smith , was set to take a letter to blair 's office at downing street urging the withdrawal of troops from iraq . another , rose gentle from scotland , flew to washington where she will march side by side with cindy sheehan , a killed american soldier 's mother who has come to symbolize the us 's anti-war movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demonstrators are buoyed by opinion polls that show a growing majority disapprove of bush 's handling of the war and question the rationale for us military action . " it seems to be playing out the way it did with vietnam .
as time goes on , more and more people begin to have doubts , " said frank nicosia , a history professor who traveled by bus with his wife from vermont to attend the march . " few people judge whether it 's right or wrong , smart or stupid .
they only ask does it effect me or does n't it ?

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority . " under the proposals , a parent who takes time off from work for a third child will have the option of a boosted monthly pay-out of 750 euros -lrb- $ 915 -rrb- for one year .
currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .
but we have to encourage professionals with higher incomes to have babies , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other changes include a doubling of the tax credit for families that hire home-help for children under six , and the extension of discounts available for families with three or more children . france better off than eu counterparts france already has a comprehensive array of incentives for child-bearing , including generous child allowances and a calibrated income tax system that means that families with more children pay less . parents with three or more children can also get " large family " cards that bring discounts on public transport .
these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy . " nonetheless the trend is not satisfactory , " it said , largely because more french women are waiting longer to have their first child . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with some 80.7 percent of women aged between 25 and 49 participating in the workforce , france has one of the highest rates of working women in europe .
but the report said that this is not incompatible with a high birth rate and that - with the proper policies - the two can go hand-in-hand . sociologist sullerot says she ’ d like to see further incentives for young mothers in the future . " my dream is that every mother will have a card that guarantees certain rights , like the right to vocational training , and the right to a better pension depending on the number of children they have , " she said . falling birth rates worries europe falling birth rates are a growing worry across the eu , with demographers predicting that large-scale immigration will be necessary in many countries in order to sustain the benefits enjoyed by a steadily aging population . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors . " this is the biggest contract in the history of our company and it will be the biggest challenge , " käfer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium will attract fans from all classes .
the better-situated will be treated like royalty a comment not to be taken lightly considering that the catering company has its own tent at the oktoberfest in munich .
yet , the oktoberfest , for all of its charming qualities , does not attract the wealthy in large numbers .
the world cup makes for a one-time opportunity for companies , particularly german ones , to show just how much they appreciate their big customers .
quality food is part of it , yet it wo n't be easy for käfer . " our workers have to be here two hours before work begins because of the extensive security checks , " he said .
" and only one company can deliver to the grounds , and that can happen 10 hours before a match at the latest .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .
so what are they capable of this season ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg still has confidence in his former team effenberg proved wrong stefan effenberg -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 2001 champions league winner with bayern , said he believes the current season is going to be an even bigger procession .
though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg . " we are not title contenders , " declared hamburg coach thomas doll .
" bayern are top and there on merit . " hamburg are second and just one point behind the tabletoppers from munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen won the german title in 2004 still plenty to play for bremen , only two points behind in third , stole the crown from bayern in 2004 but did not help their title tilt this season by selling their french defensive star valerien ismael to bayern for eight million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- . even after one loss , it is still hard to see who can even challenge bayern let alone finish above them but manager felix magath insists there is still some spice left in the bundesliga .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors . " this is the biggest contract in the history of our company and it will be the biggest challenge , " käfer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium will attract fans from all classes .
the better-situated will be treated like royalty a comment not to be taken lightly considering that the catering company has its own tent at the oktoberfest in munich .
yet , the oktoberfest , for all of its charming qualities , does not attract the wealthy in large numbers .
the world cup makes for a one-time opportunity for companies , particularly german ones , to show just how much they appreciate their big customers .
quality food is part of it , yet it wo n't be easy for käfer . " our workers have to be here two hours before work begins because of the extensive security checks , " he said .
" and only one company can deliver to the grounds , and that can happen 10 hours before a match at the latest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .

how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .

that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .

so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .

but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .
heads of government in germany are not yet established according to the rules of fist fights . ute thofern -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

but the amendments were not accepted , and the resolution was approved in the same form as proposed friday by britain .
the only vote against was venezuela while russia , which had expressed bitter opposition to the resolution , abstained . india , a member of the non-aligned movement that had opposed the resolution , voted for it . russia has an $ 800-million contract to build iran 's first nuclear reactor , china , buys iranian oil where as non-aligned states fear that referral would escalate the iranian nuclear crisis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's chief nuclear negotiator hassan rohani , 2nd left , meets with , from far right : german foreign minister joschka fischer , british foreign secretary jack straw , french foreign minister michel barnier and eu foreign policy chief javier solana in brussels eu negotiators britain , france and germany , as well as the united states , were confident they have enough votes to have the resolution adopted , if consensus can not be achieved . british , french and german foreign ministers consulted friday ahead of the board meeting as the crisis deepened . " the eu-3 held firm , " a western diplomat said . iran ready to hit back iran meanwhile was expected to react strongly if the resolution were adopted , diplomats said , threatening to make nuclear fuel in a move that could lead the west to advance the calendar for getting the security council involved . iran has said it will submit a note in writing to the iaea saying that it will begin to enrich uranium , the nuclear reactor fuel that can also be bomb material , and also cease applying a protocol for wider iaea inspections if the resolution is adopted , a diplomat close to the iaea said . another diplomat said iranian representatives had already at friday 's meeting showed elbaradei two unsigned letters as a " threat " that they could be signed and filed to signal iran 's going ahead with uranium enrichment and reducing cooperation with iaea inspections . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iranian nuclear facility at buschir in the south of the country iran has a 164-cascade of centrifuges for enriching uranium at a facility in natanz in the center of the country but has held off from activating it as a confidence-building measure for talks on its nuclear program . the draft resolution was the weaker of two texts the eu had prepared in an effort at compromise to garner support on the iaea board , as it delays immediate referral of iran to the security council . western diplomats said it would be unfortunate not to have the united message that consensus represents , but that a vote is still better than not taking action to force iran to guarantee it is not developing nuclear weapons . softer measures if iran cooperates non-aligned nations , which make up 14 of the 35-nation board , has earlier threatened to boycott saturday 's session , which would deny the two-thirds quorum needed for a vote , but it was not clear it they would hold to this . citing iran for non-compliance , which requires the iaea to at some point bring the islamic republic before the security council , would be a major development almost three years into an iaea investigation that has documented two decades of hidden iranian nuclear activities . iran 's resumption last month of uranium conversion , a first step in making enriched uranium , set off a crisis in which the united states and the eu want to call in the international weight of the security council , which could impose trade sanctions although softer measures are at first expected . iran 's re-suspending conversion could lead to referral being put off even longer .
and if tehran showed full cooperation with the iaea , it could end up being reported for this in an " information " report that would not threaten sanctions , diplomats said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the iaea had on august 11 called on iran to cease conversion but hardline iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad -lrb- photo -rrb- proclaimed in a speech to the un general assembly in september tehran 's " inalienable right " to nuclear fuel work , an uncompromising stance that angered western leaders . the draft resolution says that an iaea investigation since february 2003 has uncovered a " history of concealment of iran 's nuclear activities " which has led to a lack of confidence " that iran 's nuclear program is exclusively for peaceful purposes " and to " questions that are within the competence of the security council as the organ bearing the main responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .

protest rallies were also planned in rome , paris , madrid , copenhagen , oslo and helsinki , to coincide with a similar march in washington . the stop the war coalition , which organized the london rally jointly with the campaign for nuclear disarmament and the muslim association of britain , said it expected at least 100,000 people to take part . " today coincides with the demonstration in washington dc and is also the eve of the labour party annual conference , " which prime minister tony blair will attend in the southern city of brighton , stop the war spokesman viven lehal told afp . bildunterschrift : the demonstrators were to set off from the houses of parliament around noon -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- , arriving at hyde park two hours later where the rally was to continue .
british anti-war campaigners have been calling relentlessly for the return of the 8,500 british troops deployed as part of the us-led forces in iraq . " we want to withdraw the troops from iraq .
clearly what happened in basra this week shows that british troops are n't helping there , they make the situation worse , " lehal told afp . renewed violence in iraq the past week saw an upsurge of tensions around the southern iraqi city of basra , where many of britain 's troops in the country are based . bildunterschrift : iraqis run from the area as a british warrior fighting vehicle burns in basra , southeast of baghdad british troops stormed an iraqi police station after two british undercover soldiers were arrested by the police and then kidnapped by a shiite militia .

" i think even more people will be out today because of the attacks on london , on muslims and events in basra , " said lehal . " the attacks prove a point we 've long been making : the invasion and illegal occupation of iraq have made us a major terrorist target .
the only people who ca n't see that are in our government . " activist bianca jagger , musician brian eno , labour member of parliament tony benn and the parents of british soldiers killed in iraq were all due to address marchers . protests in washington too one soldier 's mother , sue smith , was set to take a letter to blair 's office at downing street urging the withdrawal of troops from iraq . another , rose gentle from scotland , flew to washington where she will march side by side with cindy sheehan , a killed american soldier 's mother who has come to symbolize the us 's anti-war movement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the demonstrators are buoyed by opinion polls that show a growing majority disapprove of bush 's handling of the war and question the rationale for us military action . " it seems to be playing out the way it did with vietnam .
as time goes on , more and more people begin to have doubts , " said frank nicosia , a history professor who traveled by bus with his wife from vermont to attend the march . " few people judge whether it 's right or wrong , smart or stupid .
they only ask does it effect me or does n't it ?
that 's beginning to happen now .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors . " this is the biggest contract in the history of our company and it will be the biggest challenge , " käfer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium will attract fans from all classes .
the better-situated will be treated like royalty a comment not to be taken lightly considering that the catering company has its own tent at the oktoberfest in munich .
yet , the oktoberfest , for all of its charming qualities , does not attract the wealthy in large numbers .
the world cup makes for a one-time opportunity for companies , particularly german ones , to show just how much they appreciate their big customers .
quality food is part of it , yet it wo n't be easy for käfer . " our workers have to be here two hours before work begins because of the extensive security checks , " he said .
" and only one company can deliver to the grounds , and that can happen 10 hours before a match at the latest .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .
so what are they capable of this season ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg still has confidence in his former team effenberg proved wrong stefan effenberg -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 2001 champions league winner with bayern , said he believes the current season is going to be an even bigger procession .
though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg . " we are not title contenders , " declared hamburg coach thomas doll .
" bayern are top and there on merit . " hamburg are second and just one point behind the tabletoppers from munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen won the german title in 2004 still plenty to play for bremen , only two points behind in third , stole the crown from bayern in 2004 but did not help their title tilt this season by selling their french defensive star valerien ismael to bayern for eight million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- . even after one loss , it is still hard to see who can even challenge bayern let alone finish above them but manager felix magath insists there is still some spice left in the bundesliga . " i do not think the league is threatening to become boring , " vowed magath " the season still has a long way to go and it will still be difficult for us .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .
i think that attitude needs to spread . dagmar engel interviewed arnulf baring -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany edges closer to grand coalition christian union leader angela merkel said friday that talks with greens leaders about a possible coalition failed .
that means a grand coalition between conservatives and social democrats is most likely .
-lrb- sept .
23 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : do n't underestimate merkel in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .
that 's simply undignified .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.09.2005 the disconnect between politics and reality großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians failed to understand what german voters want , says baring nearly a week after the election , germans are still no closer to knowing who will govern them .
in an interview with deutsche welle , historian arnulf baring reflected on what the poll result actually says about germany . dw-tv : last sunday the conservative parties made up of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- got about 36 per cent of the vote , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- 34 per cent , the pro-market liberal free democrats or fdp 10 per cent and the left party 7.5 per cent .
the greens won seven per cent .
what does this tell us about changes in german society ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : arnulf barning : well , it shows a crumbling of the former major parties , each of which garnered only about a third of the vote .
there have been times when together they represented nearly 90 per cent of the country 's votes .
we will probably experience a kind of normalization now with smaller parties in the future , and a corresponding problem in building coalitions to form a government .
we 'll have to get used to this and to much longer negotiations between the parties . why do you think the major parties suffered such losses ?
has something changed within the cultures of the parties ? i think so .
we used to always say that the social democratic party was the party of the workers , the employees and the union leaders .
and so it was . and the cdu / csu was the party of catholic farmers in bavaria .
but these groupings have lost their cohesion .
and in recent german history we are seeing the increasing isolation of individual voters .
they are no longer affiliated to any particular tradition or grouping and guided by them .
they are subjected to much more diverse influences . for some , the german automobile club has become more important than the catholic church .
so there is a certain disintegration and a corresponding problem for parties in articulating a clear platform . that 's because they no longer know for whom they are creating the platform . the smaller parties have done incredibly well .
we actually have a five-party system .
how would you structure the parties , could you describe them in a little detail ? well , let 's look at politics as a process of action and consolidation with " action " being those who think that much needs to be changed to prepare for the future and " consolidation " referring to those who want everything to be as it always was because things are fine . leading the " action " camp are the free democrats .
they want to go in one direction , and i believe in the future this will be unavoidable , regardless of personal ideological prejudices .
and the party of " consolidation " is clearly the left party .
they basically want to run the country using the same recipes we used in the 1970s . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the other parties - the spd , the conservatives , and even the greens are all somewhere in between .
they are part " action " and part " consolidation . "
even among the conservatives there was a great deal of reluctance to implement a bold , fdp-style program under angela merkel . and it is precisely this inner split which has caused insecurity within the major parties - how much of our tradition can we maintain , how many new ideas do we have to adopt ? the old mathematics which determined coalition constellations no longer works .
it used to always be one large party , together with a smaller party , would form a relatively stable government .
so what 's going to happen now ? personally i still believe all the talk about triple groupings going on at the moment is hot air .
the red / green / yellow coalition , the so-called traffic light coalition , and then the black / yellow / green coalition .
given the current state of consciousnesses and lack of groundwork , i do n't believe a reasonable coalition of this type will get off the ground .
i just do n't see it . bildunterschrift : i believe instead that the common ground between the cdu and the spd is in reality much larger than people are discussing today .
i noticed this in the debate between the chancellor and angela merkel - how often she mentioned initiatives on which both parties had worked together .
i had the feeling that the grand coalition was actually much more of a possibility than the campaigning suggested . do you think this election represents a final break with the old federal republic of germany , and the beginning of the berlin republic in a unified germany ? well , in 1991 , shortly after unification , i wrote that we would get a completely different party system .
the addition of the former east germany meant 20 per cent more germans - but they 're people who come from a completely different background , who have completely different experiences and different expectations of a government .
and that continues to be evident .
that does n't just fade away after 15 years .
maybe it will take 50 years before that changes , if it changes at all . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but the worst part about this campaign is that the basic problems - for instance , what do we do if it turns out that the former east germany can not be turned into something new ? if we have to assume that of the 14 million people who live in the former east germany , half of them will disappear in the next 15 to 20 years , simply because the young people continue to move away , leaving only an aging population ?
what do we do with that entire part of the country ?
what do we do with the demographic situation ? the problems facing the country are enormous , and that was not addressed .
this was referred to as an election in which our fate was being determined , but no one really talked about what that might mean . are you curious about what will happen next ? yes , very much so .
but also apprehensive , because i think it 's taking too long for people to accept reality .
we should have been taking action for the past 20 years .
the kohl administration was n't very good about being willing to make reforms , either .
and then with unification , the government lost all sense of the consequences of huge public debt . no , it really is a situation that is cause for concern . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and we are still very far removed from dealing with the challenges as a nation .
with the concentration on the economic and social issues , it 's been possible to disguise the fact that , in my opinion , we have to get people to say that we germans as a whole ca n't afford to trail behind the rest of europe in this way .
for the good of europe , but also for the good of our own future , we must become braver and more hopeful .
and preserve our society .
that has been missing entirely . i hope that in the future , that will be redressed , that we start appealing to people 's sense of community , their hopes for the future and sense of responsibility - since we are finding it so difficult to solve the economic and social problems . we need to encourage people to say , we 've successfully mastered many great crises in our history - we ca n't simply fall apart in the face of a relatively minor crisis .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .

artemis , a new four-story brothel down the road from berlin 's olympic stadium which will host the world cup finals , is set to open its doors to 650 men and 100 women , said norman jacob , the lawyer representing its anonymous backers .
but it was n't the hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic fans that convinced the owners to open what will be germany 's largest brothel .
" we did n't even think about that when we started the project , " jacob told reporters .
" but obviously it 's very nice for us that it is happening . "
both male and female visitors will be required to pay a 70 euro -lrb- $ 84 -rrb- entrance fee , and the women practicing the world 's oldest profession wo n't be employed by artemis , allowing them to negotiate directly with their customers .
prostitution has been legal in germany since 2003 , but has many in the country upset due to widespread trafficking in women .
jacob said women without a valid european union working permit would be turned away at the door and said alcohol would not be served .
hydra , a prostitute support group , told the spiegel newsmagazine it would not judge artemis until it reviewed the actual working conditions inside . dw-world.de cologne leads the way in safe prostitution the german city of cologne is implementing a successful model championed by liberal neighbors in the netherlands for providing prostitutes with a safe environment to work in away from the city center .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.09.2005 france moves to encourage large families großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a third pram with baby would complete the happy picture already boasting one of the highest birth rates in the eu , france has unveiled measures to spur women to have more children .
they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority . " under the proposals , a parent who takes time off from work for a third child will have the option of a boosted monthly pay-out of 750 euros -lrb- $ 915 -rrb- for one year .
currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .
but we have to encourage professionals with higher incomes to have babies , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other changes include a doubling of the tax credit for families that hire home-help for children under six , and the extension of discounts available for families with three or more children . france better off than eu counterparts france already has a comprehensive array of incentives for child-bearing , including generous child allowances and a calibrated income tax system that means that families with more children pay less . parents with three or more children can also get " large family " cards that bring discounts on public transport .
these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy . " nonetheless the trend is not satisfactory , " it said , largely because more french women are waiting longer to have their first child . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with some 80.7 percent of women aged between 25 and 49 participating in the workforce , france has one of the highest rates of working women in europe .
but the report said that this is not incompatible with a high birth rate and that - with the proper policies - the two can go hand-in-hand . sociologist sullerot says she ’ d like to see further incentives for young mothers in the future . " my dream is that every mother will have a card that guarantees certain rights , like the right to vocational training , and the right to a better pension depending on the number of children they have , " she said . falling birth rates worries europe falling birth rates are a growing worry across the eu , with demographers predicting that large-scale immigration will be necessary in many countries in order to sustain the benefits enjoyed by a steadily aging population . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors . " this is the biggest contract in the history of our company and it will be the biggest challenge , " käfer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium will attract fans from all classes .
the better-situated will be treated like royalty a comment not to be taken lightly considering that the catering company has its own tent at the oktoberfest in munich .
yet , the oktoberfest , for all of its charming qualities , does not attract the wealthy in large numbers .
the world cup makes for a one-time opportunity for companies , particularly german ones , to show just how much they appreciate their big customers .
quality food is part of it , yet it wo n't be easy for käfer . " our workers have to be here two hours before work begins because of the extensive security checks , " he said .
" and only one company can deliver to the grounds , and that can happen 10 hours before a match at the latest .

the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors . " this is the biggest contract in the history of our company and it will be the biggest challenge , " käfer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium will attract fans from all classes .
the better-situated will be treated like royalty a comment not to be taken lightly considering that the catering company has its own tent at the oktoberfest in munich .
yet , the oktoberfest , for all of its charming qualities , does not attract the wealthy in large numbers .
the world cup makes for a one-time opportunity for companies , particularly german ones , to show just how much they appreciate their big customers .
quality food is part of it , yet it wo n't be easy for käfer . " our workers have to be here two hours before work begins because of the extensive security checks , " he said .
" and only one company can deliver to the grounds , and that can happen 10 hours before a match at the latest . " that 's difficult circumstances to offer the finest strawberries to some of the world 's most choosy customers . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rails , roads world cup ready when millions of soccer fans descend on germany in 2006 , the country 's railways and roads will be ready for them , government officials said this week .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .

so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .

in light of the conservatives ' poor showing in german elections , many observers have been skeptical about conservative party leader angela merkel 's future .
but she could still become chancellor , says dw 's ute thofern . he who underestimates merkel has already lost .
that line is infamous in germany , but was quickly forgotten after angela merkel 's unexpectedly poor election result .
perhaps too quickly . the assessment slipped out of horst seehofer 's mouth after his party , the bavarian-based csu , was forced to make compromises in health care policies with merkel 's cdu - compromises that cost seehofer dearly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the csu 's health care expert stepped down from his position and has been considered merkel 's most prominent victim ever since .
actually , seehofer - intoxicated on the potency of his own power - shot himself in the foot by taking too heavy a risk as a political heavyweight in the christian social union .
so much so that even csu chief edmund stoiber could n't bail him out . the bigwig flopped , and angela " the girl " mutated into merkel , the male-killing monster . what a misinterpretation !
angela merkel does n't kill off her opponents ; she does n't even plot and scheme .
but she can tolerate being underestimated , und she can wait - for others to make mistakes , for example .
not about gender the fact that her alleged victims are usually men has nothing to do with her being a woman .
she 's not a " typical " woman , but the overwhelmingly male political establishment tends to make the typically male mistake of overestimating their own abilities .
this situation was best exemplified by gerhard schröder 's television appearance on the evening of the election . bildunterschrift : germany continues to puzzle over what drove him or what he had imbibed to be able to stage such a excessive act of self-indulgence in front of the camera .
at the same time , schröder 's performance was presumably calculated : taking the offensive , declaring himself the victor to force " the girl " into a corner and throw her as prey to the men in her party . it had nothing to do with the rules of democracy .
but it was a short-sighted ploy because merkel did n't fall apart as expected .
instead she used schröder 's attacks to secure the solidarity of the men in her party , which was seriously endangered up till then . indeed , those in the christian union who now take a potshot at merkel , will be suspected of backing schröder . angela merkel has been written off many more times than the self-righteous " media chancellor , " who threw some hard punches on the evening of the election . but , the woman can take more than a prize boxer .
she is relentlessly logical , adamantly calm , stoically reasonable and unnervingly persistent . those are neither female nor male characteristics , but ones with which she can still become chancellor .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority . " under the proposals , a parent who takes time off from work for a third child will have the option of a boosted monthly pay-out of 750 euros -lrb- $ 915 -rrb- for one year .
currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .
but we have to encourage professionals with higher incomes to have babies , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other changes include a doubling of the tax credit for families that hire home-help for children under six , and the extension of discounts available for families with three or more children . france better off than eu counterparts france already has a comprehensive array of incentives for child-bearing , including generous child allowances and a calibrated income tax system that means that families with more children pay less . parents with three or more children can also get " large family " cards that bring discounts on public transport .
these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy . " nonetheless the trend is not satisfactory , " it said , largely because more french women are waiting longer to have their first child . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with some 80.7 percent of women aged between 25 and 49 participating in the workforce , france has one of the highest rates of working women in europe .
but the report said that this is not incompatible with a high birth rate and that - with the proper policies - the two can go hand-in-hand . sociologist sullerot says she ’ d like to see further incentives for young mothers in the future . " my dream is that every mother will have a card that guarantees certain rights , like the right to vocational training , and the right to a better pension depending on the number of children they have , " she said . falling birth rates worries europe falling birth rates are a growing worry across the eu , with demographers predicting that large-scale immigration will be necessary in many countries in order to sustain the benefits enjoyed by a steadily aging population . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators .

though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg .

a big pie that many want a piece of . german national soccer coach jürgen klinsmann got his way .
his predecessor rudi völler , who had and still has close ties with bayer leverkusen , had negotiated a deal together with the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- to place the national team 's quarters nearby leverkusen . it was a favor in return to bayer for its long years of support of the german national team , particularly the financial help in bringing the world cup to germany .
after all , leverkusen would n't host any of the 64 world cup matches . klinsmann did n't like the idea of placing his players so far away from the happenings and excitement of the world cup .
last december , only three months in as head coach , he moved the team quarters to berlin where his squad could get a true feel of the ambience of the world cup . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen klinsmann opted to hole up the team in berlin for the world cup for the inconvenience , bayer 's functionaries were given the rights to host two friendlies .
meinolf spink , the pharmaceutical company 's sports director , called the decision at that time " a little sad . " it was not only unfortunate for leverkusen and bayer , but also a blow in the attempt to jockey for a piece of the some 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.2 billion -rrb- expected to be generated by functionaries from fifa , the world soccer body , and national soccer associations , plus millions of spectators - and of course the players . they will be pampered at their quarters , receiving massages , playing their favorite video games in their rooms or enjoying specially-prepared meals from home .
the german team may not be eating sausages in the leverkusen region but other teams must find a place to stay . brazil most sought after if the home team rejects the region around leverkusen , specifically the noble hotel " schlosshotel lerbach " in nearby bergisch-gladbach , it does n't mean that the fight is lost .
there are equally good , if not better teams , who might book their suites there .
the current number one in the world , brazil , would definitely be a prize catch . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the brazilian national team could take pleasure in dining at the schlosshotel lerbach , home of three-star-cook dieter müller the " schlosshotel lerbach " had the distinction of being the home of the selecao from brazil during the confederations cup in june .
it was a boon for the foothill region around the hotel . " the teams ' fans book their hotels in the region , travel , eat , drink and go shopping , buying everything from rolls to raincoats , " sprink from bayer told the soccer magazine 11 freunde .
" restaurant owners and retailers hear their cash registers ringing . " businesses around leverkusen hope that the team of ronaldo , ronaldinho and co. decide to stay in bergisch-gladbach again .
the chances of the brazilians to get to the finals are not bad , which would mean a whole month of samba-dancing supporters swarming around their team - and leaving their money behind . top caterers will prove their quality the teams , the thousands of functionaries and the high-income guests must also be fed .
one of munich 's top caterers , michael käfer , will have the pleasure of feeding them at stadiums around the country .
käfer , together with a french catering company and three other german ones , will be doing their best to satisfy the taste buds of up to 350,000 demanding , and wealthy , visitors . " this is the biggest contract in the history of our company and it will be the biggest challenge , " käfer said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the world cup final at berlin 's olympic stadium will attract fans from all classes .
the better-situated will be treated like royalty a comment not to be taken lightly considering that the catering company has its own tent at the oktoberfest in munich .
yet , the oktoberfest , for all of its charming qualities , does not attract the wealthy in large numbers .
the world cup makes for a one-time opportunity for companies , particularly german ones , to show just how much they appreciate their big customers .
quality food is part of it , yet it wo n't be easy for käfer . " our workers have to be here two hours before work begins because of the extensive security checks , " he said .
" and only one company can deliver to the grounds , and that can happen 10 hours before a match at the latest . " that 's difficult circumstances to offer the finest strawberries to some of the world 's most choosy customers . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rails , roads world cup ready when millions of soccer fans descend on germany in 2006 , the country 's railways and roads will be ready for them , government officials said this week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005/2006 bundesliga season bayern top as flying dutchman takes off is the bundesliga too weak ? ballack header saves bayern record bremen stick with record breaking bayern sports -pipe- 24.09.2005 bayern dominance creates boringliga großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich celebrating has nearly become a given in the bundesliga even after a loss to hamburg , the shine on bayern munich 's record has hardly been smudged .
munich may go down as germany 's most successful team ever , but some fear they 're turning the bundesliga into a dull spectacle . bayern churned out a record 15 successive league wins , nine last season and six in the current campaign , before sv hamburg was able to end their winning streak this weekend .
while the win helped second place hamburg draw closer to munich in the table , they 'll have to hope for bayern to collapse again before they can takeover at the top .
if sv hamburg or third-placed werder bremen had reached the summit on the same points the german top flight would probably have hailed the unbeaten run , but with bayern everything is different . " everyone fears a boring bundesliga because bayern appear to be unbeatable and are just marching away , " explained the daily bild newspaper before bayern 's loss on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : michael ballack celebrates a german cup victory bayern a league of their own but , as hamburg proved , it 's up to the players themselves to dethrone the colossal bavarians if they want a more exciting league , according to west germany 's 1990 world cup winner thomas berthold . " the other clubs are no longer sparring partners for bayern , " he said .
" after 10 games the league could be sewn up and then it becomes dull for the spectators . " last season bayern endured their worst start in 25 years and were down in fourth after collecting only 11 points in the first six matches . yet they still went on to finish 14 points ahead of schalke 04 and lift a 19th german championship cup .
so what are they capable of this season ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefan effenberg still has confidence in his former team effenberg proved wrong stefan effenberg -lrb- photo -rrb- , a 2001 champions league winner with bayern , said he believes the current season is going to be an even bigger procession .
though he originally predicted that his former club would n't lose a game all season , he is still convinced of bayern 's supremacy . " if you look at the league there is no team at bayern 's level , " he said .
" i predict bayern will retain their title , and it will be by more than the 16-point advantage in the 2002/03 season . " schalke 04 posed a brief threat last season but already lie eight points behind so the onus falls on the shoulders of werder bremen and sv hamburg . " we are not title contenders , " declared hamburg coach thomas doll .
" bayern are top and there on merit . " hamburg are second and just one point behind the tabletoppers from munich . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : werder bremen won the german title in 2004 still plenty to play for bremen , only two points behind in third , stole the crown from bayern in 2004 but did not help their title tilt this season by selling their french defensive star valerien ismael to bayern for eight million euros -lrb- $ 6.6 million -rrb- . even after one loss , it is still hard to see who can even challenge bayern let alone finish above them but manager felix magath insists there is still some spice left in the bundesliga . " i do not think the league is threatening to become boring , " vowed magath " the season still has a long way to go and it will still be difficult for us . " german football neutrals will hope so , but bayern fans are content with letting the dominance continue . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin beats cologne in historic win in their first real test of the season , bayern munich suffered their first loss in 15 games in hamburg saturday , putting some spice back into the bundesliga title race .

" i think even more people will be out today because of the attacks on london , on muslims and events in basra , " said lehal .

they include an increased monthly grant for mothers who take time off work for a third baby . france has one of the highest birth rates in europe .
of the 25 nations in the european union , only ireland ’ s rate is higher . but experts say france still isn ’ t producing enough children to support its ageing population in the future . evelyne sullerot , one of france ’ s leading sociologists , points out that france also has one of europe ’ s highest proportions of women in the workforce .
she adds that more needs to be done to promote a balance between work and family life . " things aren ’ t going well in france .
with 1.9 children per woman , we have one of the highest birth rates in europe .
but it ’ s still not enough for us to reproduce our generations , " said sullerot . " there ’ s really a perception out there that women who want to pursue a career are forced to delay having a family . " the government agrees .
this week an initiative , which is aimed at boosting the country 's birth rate up to so-called " replacement " level , was unveiled at an annual conference on the family in paris attended by government ministers , pro-family campaigners , employers and trade unions . more incentives for big-earners france currently has a fertility rate of 1.916 children per woman - slightly below the 2.07 figure which is required for the population to renew itself over the generations . bildunterschrift : prime minister dominique de villepin said the new measures were intended to " allow a better conciliation between professional and family life up to the child 's majority . " under the proposals , a parent who takes time off from work for a third child will have the option of a boosted monthly pay-out of 750 euros -lrb- $ 915 -rrb- for one year .
currently the figure is set at $ 500 available over three years . according to hubert brin , president of the national union of family associations -lrb- unaf -rrb- , the increased payment is to encourage higher-earners to have a third child . the current rate is only attractive for couples on low incomes .
but we have to encourage professionals with higher incomes to have babies , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : other changes include a doubling of the tax credit for families that hire home-help for children under six , and the extension of discounts available for families with three or more children . france better off than eu counterparts france already has a comprehensive array of incentives for child-bearing , including generous child allowances and a calibrated income tax system that means that families with more children pay less . parents with three or more children can also get " large family " cards that bring discounts on public transport .
these will now also include cut-price deals on household goods and leisure activities . " the demographic situation in our country is much less unfavorable than in some of our european neighbors , " according to a unaf report , which noted that fertility is at 1.2 percent in spain and italy . " nonetheless the trend is not satisfactory , " it said , largely because more french women are waiting longer to have their first child . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with some 80.7 percent of women aged between 25 and 49 participating in the workforce , france has one of the highest rates of working women in europe .
but the report said that this is not incompatible with a high birth rate and that - with the proper policies - the two can go hand-in-hand . sociologist sullerot says she ’ d like to see further incentives for young mothers in the future . " my dream is that every mother will have a card that guarantees certain rights , like the right to vocational training , and the right to a better pension depending on the number of children they have , " she said . falling birth rates worries europe falling birth rates are a growing worry across the eu , with demographers predicting that large-scale immigration will be necessary in many countries in order to sustain the benefits enjoyed by a steadily aging population . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : adopting a new attitude towards children the trend of falling birth rates and the evolution of a society in which child raising is perceived as more of a challenge than an enchantment is visible beyond germany ’ s labor wards .

home secretary charles clarke has asked the panel to particularly look at high strength cannabis , known as " skunk " .
when the advisory council on the misuse of drugs met in 2002 , evidence stated cannabis could worsen some conditions .
studies since have said the drug can cause psychiatric problems , while the dutch may now outlaw stronger strains . "
we think the government made the right decision " harry shapiro drugscope in the uk , the council 's conclusions three years ago helped persuade the government to make cannabis a class c rather than class b drug .
police officers were also told not to arrest adults for possessing the drug for their own use .
however , there are new concerns because skunk and other more-powerful varieties of cannabis contain high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient .
in holland the potency of cannabis has increased , leading the government there to consider reclassifying some strains alongside harder drugs .
' anecdotal evidence ' one british father believes smoking cannabis helped precipitate schizophrenia in his son six years ago .
terry hammond , from southampton , told the bbc his son stephen , 27 , started hearing voices after a " binge " on cannabis joints .
" he collapsed in a disco , and when he came round he heard voices saying ' it 's ok steve - you can get up ' but there was no-one there talking .
" he has heard them ever since .
the doctors are saying it -lsb- cannabis -rsb- was definitely a trigger . "
mr hammond , who works with mental health charity rethink , added : " the anecdotal evidence is screaming at us , there are not an insignificant number of people being affected by cannabis . "
and paul smedley , of drug awareness charity dare uk , said cannabis should not have been reclassified , calling the move to class c " quite dangerous " .
' right decision ' when mr clarke wrote to the advisory council on the misuse of drugs this march , he highlighted concerns over studies that strongly-linked cannabis use to the development of psychosis .
however , he also wrote that since the downgrading of cannabis there had been no proven increase in use of the drug .
metropolitan police chief sir ian blair , the uk 's top police officer , has also said he does not want the relaxation of cannabis laws reversed as dealing with small amounts of the drug wasted police time .

home secretary charles clarke has asked the panel to particularly look at high strength cannabis , known as " skunk " .
when the advisory council on the misuse of drugs met in 2002 , evidence stated cannabis could worsen some conditions .
studies since have said the drug can cause psychiatric problems , while the dutch may now outlaw stronger strains .
we think the government made the right decision harry shapiro drugscope in the uk , the council 's conclusions three years ago helped persuade the government to make cannabis a class c rather than class b drug .
police officers were also told not to arrest adults for possessing the drug for their own use .
however , there are new concerns because skunk and other more-powerful varieties of cannabis contain high levels of tetrahydrocannabinol -lrb- thc -rrb- , the active ingredient .

mr hammond , who works with mental health charity rethink , added : " the anecdotal evidence is screaming at us , there are not an insignificant number of people being affected by cannabis . "

however , he also wrote that since the downgrading of cannabis there had been no proven increase in use of the drug .
metropolitan police chief sir ian blair , the uk 's top police officer , has also said he does not want the relaxation of cannabis laws reversed as dealing with small amounts of the drug wasted police time .

the seaside city , just a stone 's throw from the south downs , is probably the most popular party conference destination .
of course , they all come for the important debates , the policy decisions , the chance to meet up with old mates from constituency associations across the country .
but once the business is done and agendas are tossed aside , it is brighton 's cosmopolitan night-life that delegates set out to enjoy .
labour mp david lepper , whose brighton pavilion constituency plays host to this year 's annual gathering , gives his views on the city 's highlights .
why do people love brighton so much ?
" it 's simple really - people just like coming here .
whether the weather is good or not , there is always plenty to see as well as the conference .
best eatery locations : the lanes north laines church street preston street kemptown brighton : in pictures " if you are looking for something to do , there 's the theatre royal , the brighton dome , the royal pavilion - the only royal palace owned by a local council - brighton pier and the seafront .
" and if you have got the time , stroll along past the pier to the volks railway - the first public electric railway in the world - and take a trip to brighton marina village .
" there is plenty there in terms of restaurants , shops and boats , plus the walk of fame , where celebrities are commemorated with plaques , just like the ones you would find in hollywood .
" the other big plus for us is so many of the hotels and guest houses are close to the main conference centre , so there is n't far to walk . "
where are the best places to eat in brighton ?
" well , you are going to be spoilt for choice .
we have got more restaurants than any city of a comparable size anywhere in the country - and their numbers seem to be increasing all the time .
" the cuisine of every nationality in the world is represented somewhere here .
" there are a whole host of restaurants and bars in and around the lanes and north laines .
you could also head to church road , preston street and kemptown .
" and brighton is a great place for veggies - it was voted the " best uk destination for vegetarians " in 2004 by the vegetarian society . "
who throws the best conference party ?
it is usually the daily mirror party , says mr lepper , which normally has a good band and dancing - although the newspaper is not thought to be holding a bash this year .
there are also regional conference parties to attend as well. adds mr lepper .
what is the best part of conference ?
" obviously there is a serious side to them , with important decisions and debate about policy .
but over the last few years we have had really excellent guest speakers address the conference , like nelson mandela , bill clinton and bono - people who have made an important contribution . "
and what about shopping ?
" brighton is a shopper 's paradise .
if people want something a bit different they should head to the lanes and north laines .
the traders there have put a great deal of effort into brightening up that area .
" while brighton has lots of specialist shops and boutiques , there are also the high street chains in churchill square . "

there are also regional conference parties to attend as well. adds mr lepper .
what is the best part of conference ?
" obviously there is a serious side to them , with important decisions and debate about policy .
but over the last few years we have had really excellent guest speakers address the conference , like nelson mandela , bill clinton and bono - people who have made an important contribution . "
and what about shopping ?
" brighton is a shopper 's paradise .
if people want something a bit different they should head to the lanes and north laines .
the traders there have put a great deal of effort into brightening up that area .
" while brighton has lots of specialist shops and boutiques , there are also the high street chains in churchill square . "
