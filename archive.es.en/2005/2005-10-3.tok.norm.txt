andreas lämmel led with 37 percent , while marlies volkmer of the spd received 32.1 percent . after the inconclusive general election on sept .
18 , the new results mean that the cdu will hold 226 seats in the bundestag versus 222 for the spd . cdu candidate lämmel said the voters had sent a clear signal to berlin , and specifically the german chancellor . " what this means for gerhard schröder is that it 's time for him to pack his bags and move back to hanover , " he said . " we will definitely begin a new round of exploratory talks with the spd on wednesday , " agreed cdu general secretary volker kauder .
" i think progress will be made . "
he also stressed that were schröder to back down , the talks would be far likely to reach a speedier conclusion .
" we expect the spd to see sense , " he said .
" the results in dresden obviously strengthen angela merkel 's position and send a clear signal to the spd . " spd stands firm germany held its general election two weeks ago but the vote was postponed in dresden 's first district due to the death of a candidate from the neo-nazi npd party . cdu leader angela merkel , aiming to become the germany 's first female chancellor , is expected to exploit the gains in the bitter power struggle that ensued after both she and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder claimed to have a mandate to lead the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german social democratic party candidate marlies volkmer , left , watches with a canvasser the announcement of the first election results in the city hall in dresden , eastern germany , on sunday , oct .
2 , 2005 .
despite the inevitable disappointment , the social democrats were n't despairing after sunday 's poll .
while their candidate was n't directly elected , they won most of the second ballots that german voters place for a party , rather than the local contender . " if the spd is the strongest party in dresden , then that strengthens the party nationally as well - in the initial coalition talks and the later negotiations , " stressed marlies volkmer . spd leader franz müntefering agreed .
" we remain the strongest party , " he said , " while the cdu / csu remain the strongest parliamentary group . " impasse to end ? the country has been at a political impasse since the september poll , with both schröder and merkel claiming a mandate due to the knife-edge result .
while the outcome of the dresden vote does n't significantly alter that result , germans expect it will give the conservatives a psychological edge heading into the next round of coalition talks . bildunterschrift : angela merkel now has the psychological edge over gerhard schröder in the race for the chancellorship some 219,000 registered voters in dresden were called to the polls to decide the final make-up of the bundestag , with three seats at stake .
more than 72 percent of eligible voters had cast ballots , election officials said after the polls closed at 6:00 p.m. high voter turnout the high turnout reflected how seriously dresden residents took the election .
on friday , around 5,000 people showed up at a final campaign rally held by the spd , while almost 1,000 attended a simultaneous event held by the cdu .
but while it looked then as though schröder had the lead , sunday 's result told a different story . roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , said the vote confirmed the cdu and their bavarian sister party , the csu , as the strongest bloc in parliament , and said that it should choose the next chancellor . spd chairman franz müntefering stuck to the course of the past two weeks , saying the dresden result would not have any effect on the coalition talks with the cdu and csu .
the spd 's party leaders will meet monday night , while the next round of coalition talks is scheduled for wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu leading in early dresden results the conservative christian democrats were leading chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats sunday in the final district to vote in the german national election , preliminary results showed .

rice allegedly spoke by telephone with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , telling him that the eu 's proposed negotiating framework for the talks would not impinge on nato .
the call came after turkey cemented the existing deadlock by objecting to a clause stipulating that it could not block eu members joining international organizations and treaties , which turkish hardliners argue could prevent ankara blocking a divided cyprus from joining nato . the initial start to the eu-turkey talks has already been postponed by british foreign secretary jack straw , on behalf of eu president britain , who said early monday that he was not certain a deal could be struck . " i hope that we are able to make progress but i can not say for certain that we will be able to make progress , " he told reporters . austrian intransigence austria is the country digging its heels in most firmly , refusing to agree to a mandate for the negotiations unless an alternative to full eu membership for the muslim country is offered .
" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .
some cited opposition to turkey 's eu hopes as a reason for voting no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey has brought two europes face to face , " commented turkish newspaper vatan monday .
" a europe that looks to a future of absolute peace by ending religious diaparity and conflict , and a europe that seeks to preserve its religious identity with xenophobia and racist , nationalistic fundamentalism . " " very little progress " austria 's plassnik , arriving for a bilateral meeting with straw ahead of the resumed eu talks , said there could still be a deal , even though admitting that " very little progress " had been made so far . " we have n't yet given up hope , " she told reporters .
" we need to move towards each other , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jack straw plassnik refused to bow under the pressure of being confronted by all her fellow european union members . " we are not afraid of difficult situations , " she told reporters after another round of talks with straw .
" there are limits , and we are about to explore them now . " turkey threatens to turn its back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül in ankara , turkish foreign minister abdullah gül huddled with his advisors awaiting news that never came that austria had ceded ground .
despite its eu ambitions , turkey has threatened to turn its back if vienna gets its way . after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , the vast , predominantly muslim country was given a date of oct .
3 to start talks by eu leaders in december . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognise eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . the present dispute focuses on the wording of the " negotiating framework " for the accession talks - essentially their guiding procedures and principles - which austria wants to refer to something other than full membership . eu - a christian club ? but it is difficult to see exactly what change of wording is needed . the current draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says that eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
vienna would like that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the new eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , warned the eu against being a " christian club " by refusing to start the talks . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player ... or it will limit itself to a christian club , " he said . the croatian factor one unknown factor is exactly how much stock austria puts in neighboring croatia being given the green light on monday to start its own delayed talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croation war crimes suspect ante gotovina croatia was originally to have started eu entry talks in march , but its case has been held up by its lack of cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal , notably over a key war crimes suspect , fugitive general ante gotovina -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-dietrich genscher , who as german foreign minister was instrumental in croatia being internationally recognized as an independent state , argued in favor of the country joining the bloc .
" the admission of slovenia shows that it was advantageous for the slovenes but also for the current eu member states .
and the same thing holds true for croatia .
croatia has covered a remarkable path to democracy .
croatia fulfills the prerequisites for eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 03.10.2005 unification : a tale of two cities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a few new skyscrapers are n't enough to rebuild a nation back in 1990 , pundits predicted it would take a generation to meld the two germanys .
dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .

but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .

she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .

rice allegedly spoke by telephone with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , telling him that the eu 's proposed negotiating framework for the talks would not impinge on nato .
the call came after turkey cemented the existing deadlock by objecting to a clause stipulating that it could not block eu members joining international organizations and treaties , which turkish hardliners argue could prevent ankara blocking a divided cyprus from joining nato . the initial start to the eu-turkey talks has already been postponed by british foreign secretary jack straw , on behalf of eu president britain , who said early monday that he was not certain a deal could be struck . " i hope that we are able to make progress but i can not say for certain that we will be able to make progress , " he told reporters . austrian intransigence austria is the country digging its heels in most firmly , refusing to agree to a mandate for the negotiations unless an alternative to full eu membership for the muslim country is offered .
" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

germany 's bild am sonntag said the first german patients would add their names to the suit against merck on monday in chicago , accusing the company of continuing to sell vioxx even after grave concerns about the drug arose .
" thousands of victims could have been avoided if merck had acted responsibly , " berlin attorney andreas schulz , who is representing 1,042 people who claim to have suffered severe side effects from vioxx , told the newspaper .
he said that merck should have taken vioxx off the market one year before it did , due to what he said was already clear evidence that the product could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
schulz said he hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with merck , which is facing a deluge of lawsuits over vioxx .
a texas jury in august awarded damages totaling more than 253 million dollars to carol ernst , whose 59-year-old triathlete husband , robert , died in may 2001 from heart failure after using vioxx to treat pain in his hands .
merck has been bombarded with lawsuits around the world since it pulled the $ 2.5-billion-a-year -lrb- 2.1 billion euro -rrb- seller vioxx from the market in september 2004 after an internal study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks .
the drug was taken by more than 20 million people worldwide before its withdrawal . dw-world.de the decline of german pharma companies the country that brought the world aspirin has n't been the " world 's pharmacy " for quite some time .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge europe -pipe- 03.10.2005 opinion : germany must accept differences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unification ethos says life in east and west should be similar instead of being proud of what they 've achieved in 15 years of unification , germany 's mood is dominated by discontent .
but after 40 years of separation , how could the differences have been leveled out any more quickly ? former chancellor helmut kohl promised " flourishing landscapes " 15 years ago , when german unification was implemented .
but such high-flying expectations evaporated long ago ; the outcome is sobering .
it can be seen in the emigration statistics that show that , every year , more people leave germany 's east for the country 's west than vice versa .
since german unification , on oct .
3 , 1990 , nearly 1 million people have turned their backs on eastern germany . that ca n't be merely glossed over .
it brings to light a problem linked to unification that 's been suppressed : above all , eastern germany is losing young people because they see few prospects on the job market .
the cities and towns are becoming ever emptier ; the education level is falling ; tax income in eastern german states and municipalities is dropping and qualified personnel is lacking all over .
nowhere in germany are fewer babies born than in the " new " eastern states .
demographers have raised the alarm .
sacrifices on both sides instead of a " flourishing landscape , " eastern germany is still an immense construction site on which work is being done in a more or less hapless fashion .
the current situation certainly was n't caused by a deficit in solidarity .
every year around 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- are transferred from western to eastern germany , generous developmental aid that 's intended to continue until 2020 .
numerous economic experts see the transfers as a main cause for germany 's weak economy and high unemployment .
and these problems will continue to exist as long as eastern germany does n't stand on its own two feet economically . there 's no doubt that money for developing the east is needed .
the crucial issue , however , is how effectively the money is being used .
economists have long been demanding that politicians correct their approach and increasingly put the money in investments instead of financing unproductive consumption .
instead of continuing on the same route , we need a more open and unsparing analysis of what development is realistically possible .
concretely , how far should germany pursue the original aim of bringing living conditions in east and west into alignment ?
many politicians have avoided such a discussion so far - it could cost votes .
bildunterschrift : bmw in leipzig still divided of course , the outcome of the past 15 years has by no means been purely negative .
a lot has happened in germany 's east .
the infrastructure has been completely modernized ; city centers have to a large extent been restored ; in places such as leipzig , competitive industrial centers have been established .
for eastern germans modern cars , color tvs , refrigerators and vacations have become as much a matter of course as they have long been for western germans .
above all , the freedom they gained when the berlin wall fell is worth any sacrifice . but 15 years are hardly enough to seamlessly meld together a nation divided for 40 years .
that which divided them pales , but much more slowly than many people are willing to admit .
more than half of western germans see the eastern germans as unification 's profiteers and consider them unappreciative of the many sacrifices the westerners made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in jena , eastern germany , against welfare reform .
the sign reads , " we are the poeple , " which was east germans ' rallying cry when the berlin wall fell .
on the other hand , more than a third of the people in the east think that those in the west have the upper hand when it comes to unification .
many of them feel patronized , that the west german model was simply imposed on them and even east germany 's positive aspects - the compatibility of family and work , for example - were abolished .
but germans do n't really like to talk about these sentiments in public because they fear it will fan the flames of envy between east and west , and that they will be labelled opponents of unification . but a bit more sangfroid would do the discussion good .
firstly , despite all the talk about unified germany 's situation , the overwhelming majority of germans , from east and west , view reunification positively .
secondly , it 's an illusion to think that 40 years of differing developments take place without leaving a trace on a country and its people .
why is it so difficult to accept that differences - in the way people think and feel as well as in people 's living conditions - exist ?
perhaps it 's because germany has n't yet prepared itself for such a possibility .
it 's about time we got used to the idea . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him . schröder said before a meeting of his social democrats that he would accept any decision his party made on whether he should continue to fight conservative rival angela merkel to claim a third term as german leader .
" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .

he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .
he said the party had no plans to dump him and would hold their ground , at least until coalition negotiations formally begin .

" the two parties were to meet wednesday for a third round of talks on whether to begin formal negotiations on a grand coalition . after attending a german unification day event in potsdam , merkel said she was optimistic that sunday 's final chapter , with the election in dresden , would pave the way for productive talks .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him . schröder said before a meeting of his social democrats that he would accept any decision his party made on whether he should continue to fight conservative rival angela merkel to claim a third term as german leader .
" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .
18 , schröder has insisted that the knife-edge result showed that voters were uncomfortable with the idea of merkel as chancellor after months in which she was flying high in the polls . bildunterschrift : schröder , left , and the spd chairman franz müntefering he said the social democrats ' come-from-behind result to near parity with the christian democrats showed that germans wanted him as their leader , even if his seven-year coalition with the greens had been voted out . he had vowed on election night that he would not let his party join any government led by angela merkel , the leader of the conservative christian democrats . however , the statements by schröder on monday seemed to confirm speculation that the spd was using the chancellor as a bargaining chip to gain leverage in possible talks about any " grand coalition , " which are sure to be contentious . in fact , spd chairman franz müntefering had earlier signaled a willingness for compromise over the chancellor question .
he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .
he said the party had no plans to dump him and would hold their ground , at least until coalition negotiations formally begin . " that is the basis upon which we will enter the negotiations , " he said . cdu wants " productive " talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel , speaks to her audience during an election campaign event in the city of dresden , eastern germany , friday , sept .

-lrb- ap photo / christian seeling -rrb- merkel , for her part , has been stunned by schröder 's decision to cling to power and insisted that as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group it is her right to become germany 's first woman leader . conservatives had speculated that schröder would opt to step aside after the last district had voted sunday , a rumor schröder spokesman dismissed over the weekend as " total nonsense . " the two parties were to meet wednesday for a third round of talks on whether to begin formal negotiations on a grand coalition . after attending a german unification day event in potsdam , merkel said she was optimistic that sunday 's final chapter , with the election in dresden , would pave the way for productive talks . " it 's a good result for the cdu and i 'm counting on forces of reason in the spd to come forward now so that things can proceed in an orderly manner , " merkel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel increases leverage in dresden vote in dresden , germany 's final district to vote , angela merkel 's conservatives extended their lead over gerhard schröder 's social democrats , giving her the edge in the power struggle over who should become chancellor .

germany 's bild am sonntag said the first german patients would add their names to the suit against merck on monday in chicago , accusing the company of continuing to sell vioxx even after grave concerns about the drug arose .
" thousands of victims could have been avoided if merck had acted responsibly , " berlin attorney andreas schulz , who is representing 1,042 people who claim to have suffered severe side effects from vioxx , told the newspaper .
he said that merck should have taken vioxx off the market one year before it did , due to what he said was already clear evidence that the product could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
schulz said he hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with merck , which is facing a deluge of lawsuits over vioxx .
a texas jury in august awarded damages totaling more than 253 million dollars to carol ernst , whose 59-year-old triathlete husband , robert , died in may 2001 from heart failure after using vioxx to treat pain in his hands .
merck has been bombarded with lawsuits around the world since it pulled the $ 2.5-billion-a-year -lrb- 2.1 billion euro -rrb- seller vioxx from the market in september 2004 after an internal study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks .

but after 40 years of separation , how could the differences have been leveled out any more quickly ? former chancellor helmut kohl promised " flourishing landscapes " 15 years ago , when german unification was implemented .
but such high-flying expectations evaporated long ago ; the outcome is sobering .
it can be seen in the emigration statistics that show that , every year , more people leave germany 's east for the country 's west than vice versa .
since german unification , on oct .
3 , 1990 , nearly 1 million people have turned their backs on eastern germany . that ca n't be merely glossed over .
it brings to light a problem linked to unification that 's been suppressed : above all , eastern germany is losing young people because they see few prospects on the job market .
the cities and towns are becoming ever emptier ; the education level is falling ; tax income in eastern german states and municipalities is dropping and qualified personnel is lacking all over .
nowhere in germany are fewer babies born than in the " new " eastern states .
demographers have raised the alarm .
sacrifices on both sides instead of a " flourishing landscape , " eastern germany is still an immense construction site on which work is being done in a more or less hapless fashion .
the current situation certainly was n't caused by a deficit in solidarity .
every year around 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- are transferred from western to eastern germany , generous developmental aid that 's intended to continue until 2020 .
numerous economic experts see the transfers as a main cause for germany 's weak economy and high unemployment .
and these problems will continue to exist as long as eastern germany does n't stand on its own two feet economically . there 's no doubt that money for developing the east is needed .
the crucial issue , however , is how effectively the money is being used .
economists have long been demanding that politicians correct their approach and increasingly put the money in investments instead of financing unproductive consumption .
instead of continuing on the same route , we need a more open and unsparing analysis of what development is realistically possible .
concretely , how far should germany pursue the original aim of bringing living conditions in east and west into alignment ?
many politicians have avoided such a discussion so far - it could cost votes .
bildunterschrift : bmw in leipzig still divided of course , the outcome of the past 15 years has by no means been purely negative .
a lot has happened in germany 's east .
the infrastructure has been completely modernized ; city centers have to a large extent been restored ; in places such as leipzig , competitive industrial centers have been established .
for eastern germans modern cars , color tvs , refrigerators and vacations have become as much a matter of course as they have long been for western germans .
above all , the freedom they gained when the berlin wall fell is worth any sacrifice . but 15 years are hardly enough to seamlessly meld together a nation divided for 40 years .
that which divided them pales , but much more slowly than many people are willing to admit .
more than half of western germans see the eastern germans as unification 's profiteers and consider them unappreciative of the many sacrifices the westerners made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in jena , eastern germany , against welfare reform .
the sign reads , " we are the poeple , " which was east germans ' rallying cry when the berlin wall fell .
on the other hand , more than a third of the people in the east think that those in the west have the upper hand when it comes to unification .
many of them feel patronized , that the west german model was simply imposed on them and even east germany 's positive aspects - the compatibility of family and work , for example - were abolished .
but germans do n't really like to talk about these sentiments in public because they fear it will fan the flames of envy between east and west , and that they will be labelled opponents of unification . but a bit more sangfroid would do the discussion good .
firstly , despite all the talk about unified germany 's situation , the overwhelming majority of germans , from east and west , view reunification positively .
secondly , it 's an illusion to think that 40 years of differing developments take place without leaving a trace on a country and its people .
why is it so difficult to accept that differences - in the way people think and feel as well as in people 's living conditions - exist ?
perhaps it 's because germany has n't yet prepared itself for such a possibility .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him . schröder said before a meeting of his social democrats that he would accept any decision his party made on whether he should continue to fight conservative rival angela merkel to claim a third term as german leader .
" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .
18 , schröder has insisted that the knife-edge result showed that voters were uncomfortable with the idea of merkel as chancellor after months in which she was flying high in the polls . bildunterschrift : schröder , left , and the spd chairman franz müntefering he said the social democrats ' come-from-behind result to near parity with the christian democrats showed that germans wanted him as their leader , even if his seven-year coalition with the greens had been voted out . he had vowed on election night that he would not let his party join any government led by angela merkel , the leader of the conservative christian democrats . however , the statements by schröder on monday seemed to confirm speculation that the spd was using the chancellor as a bargaining chip to gain leverage in possible talks about any " grand coalition , " which are sure to be contentious . in fact , spd chairman franz müntefering had earlier signaled a willingness for compromise over the chancellor question .
he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .
he said the party had no plans to dump him and would hold their ground , at least until coalition negotiations formally begin . " that is the basis upon which we will enter the negotiations , " he said . cdu wants " productive " talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel , speaks to her audience during an election campaign event in the city of dresden , eastern germany , friday , sept .

-lrb- ap photo / christian seeling -rrb- merkel , for her part , has been stunned by schröder 's decision to cling to power and insisted that as the leader of the biggest parliamentary group it is her right to become germany 's first woman leader . conservatives had speculated that schröder would opt to step aside after the last district had voted sunday , a rumor schröder spokesman dismissed over the weekend as " total nonsense . " the two parties were to meet wednesday for a third round of talks on whether to begin formal negotiations on a grand coalition . after attending a german unification day event in potsdam , merkel said she was optimistic that sunday 's final chapter , with the election in dresden , would pave the way for productive talks . " it 's a good result for the cdu and i 'm counting on forces of reason in the spd to come forward now so that things can proceed in an orderly manner , " merkel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel increases leverage in dresden vote in dresden , germany 's final district to vote , angela merkel 's conservatives extended their lead over gerhard schröder 's social democrats , giving her the edge in the power struggle over who should become chancellor .

there is widespread speculation that croatia 's and turkey 's eu bids are linked . the talks have been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join , diplomats say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul , left , with german foreign minister joschka fischer in 2004 the eu was forced to postpone a planned ceremony monday afternoon to formally open the talks with turkey , whose foreign minister abdullah gul remained in ankara pending confirmation of an accord . it was assumed that the signing ceremony would be taking place later monday in luxembourg . knocking at the door after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , eu leaders meeting in december gave the vast predominantly muslim country a date of october 3 to start membership talks . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognize eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . it remained unclear late monday what exact wording was finally agreed for the negotiating framework . the latest draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
austria wanted that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan leaves a meeting with his ministers in kizilcahamam near the capital ankara on monday , oct .

british foreign secretary jack straw said monday crisis talks between the eu foreign ministers over admitting turkey to the european union were in trouble and start of entry talks with ankara later in the day were quietly postponed .
erdogan said he maintained " hope until the last minute " that eu leaders would overcome the deadlock .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , had urged the eu to show good sense before the accord was struck . " if the eu wants to become a global power , if it aims to eliminate the conflict of civilizations , the concert of civilizations must be achieved , " he said . the eu has long underlined that the fact of starting membership negotiations does not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
in any case the talks are likely to take at least a decade , during which turkey will have to bring comply with a succession of " chapters , " or eu policy areas , forcing it to come meet eu standards . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

rice allegedly spoke by telephone with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , telling him that the eu 's proposed negotiating framework for the talks would not impinge on nato .
the call came after turkey cemented the existing deadlock by objecting to a clause stipulating that it could not block eu members joining international organizations and treaties , which turkish hardliners argue could prevent ankara blocking a divided cyprus from joining nato . the initial start to the eu-turkey talks has already been postponed by british foreign secretary jack straw , on behalf of eu president britain , who said early monday that he was not certain a deal could be struck . " i hope that we are able to make progress but i can not say for certain that we will be able to make progress , " he told reporters . austrian intransigence austria is the country digging its heels in most firmly , refusing to agree to a mandate for the negotiations unless an alternative to full eu membership for the muslim country is offered .
" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .
some cited opposition to turkey 's eu hopes as a reason for voting no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey has brought two europes face to face , " commented turkish newspaper vatan monday .
" a europe that looks to a future of absolute peace by ending religious diaparity and conflict , and a europe that seeks to preserve its religious identity with xenophobia and racist , nationalistic fundamentalism . " " very little progress " austria 's plassnik , arriving for a bilateral meeting with straw ahead of the resumed eu talks , said there could still be a deal , even though admitting that " very little progress " had been made so far . " we have n't yet given up hope , " she told reporters .
" we need to move towards each other , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jack straw plassnik refused to bow under the pressure of being confronted by all her fellow european union members . " we are not afraid of difficult situations , " she told reporters after another round of talks with straw .
" there are limits , and we are about to explore them now . " turkey threatens to turn its back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül in ankara , turkish foreign minister abdullah gül huddled with his advisors awaiting news that never came that austria had ceded ground .
despite its eu ambitions , turkey has threatened to turn its back if vienna gets its way . after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , the vast , predominantly muslim country was given a date of oct .
3 to start talks by eu leaders in december . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognise eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . the present dispute focuses on the wording of the " negotiating framework " for the accession talks - essentially their guiding procedures and principles - which austria wants to refer to something other than full membership . eu - a christian club ? but it is difficult to see exactly what change of wording is needed . the current draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says that eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
vienna would like that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the new eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , warned the eu against being a " christian club " by refusing to start the talks . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player ... or it will limit itself to a christian club , " he said . the croatian factor one unknown factor is exactly how much stock austria puts in neighboring croatia being given the green light on monday to start its own delayed talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croation war crimes suspect ante gotovina croatia was originally to have started eu entry talks in march , but its case has been held up by its lack of cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal , notably over a key war crimes suspect , fugitive general ante gotovina -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-dietrich genscher , who as german foreign minister was instrumental in croatia being internationally recognized as an independent state , argued in favor of the country joining the bloc .
" the admission of slovenia shows that it was advantageous for the slovenes but also for the current eu member states .

in the central ceremony in potsdam , politicians praised the accomplishments of the " peaceful revolution " in east germany . the main ceremony is being held in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
there president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , christian democratic leader angela merkel and other top political figures are attending the commemorative events . potsdam , which is the capital of the state of brandenburg , was chosen to host the central ceremony because that state now has the chairmanship of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . wolfgang thierse , social democratic parliamentarian and president of the bundestag , praised german reunification as a result " achieved with difficulty " of the peaceful revolution that took place in 1989 in the german democratic republic , or east germany .
he described the downfall of the east german dictatorship as a " happy chapter " of german history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , left , and the social democratic chairman , franz müntefering , right , smile together prior to the start of the celebrations for the 15th anniversary of german reunification in potsdam .
in reference to germany 's current difficult times - economic stagnation , particularly in the east , political uncertainty after inconclusive federal elections , and contentious debates about reforming welfare and labor laws - he reminded those in attendance that one should not forget that the euphoria of large accomplishments are often followed by more sober periods and " laborious small steps . " matthias platzeck , premier of brandenburg and another social democrat , warned of " exaggerated pessimism " when looking at the previous 15 years of unity .
he admitted that there had been mistakes in the process , but said one should not lose sight of the positive things that had been accomplished . unlike , for example , independence day celebrations in the united states or bastille day events in france , there was little flag waving or outbreaks of national pride in germany on monday .
it was instead a rather sober day of discussion and looking back .
that is partly to do with germans ' general reticence to ever wave a national flag , partly due to the insecurity over the current state of the nation and mixed feelings about whether the country is better off today than it was a decade and a half ago . church service the series of events began with an ecumenical service in potsdam 's nicholaikirche .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , emphasized in his sermon that the controversial reforms now being undertaken in germany , and seen with much trepidation particularly in the eastern part of the country , would find more acceptance if they were made in the " spirit of social justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber , left , and georg sterzinsky , bischop of berlin berlin 's archbishop georg sterzinsky , who also spoke at the religious service , said much had changed for the better in the past 15 years , but that unification had also give rise to new worries , such as fear of unemployment .
those emotions , he said , had to be taken seriously . later monday evening helmut kohl , chancellor at the time of reunification , will be awarded the quadriga prize , an award that recognizes people who have set outstanding examples in the political , social or economic fields .
former soviet president mikhail gorbachev will give a speech in kohl 's honor . " little berlin " several leaders of the union bloc of parties , the christian democratic union and the bavarian christian social union , will be on hand at a ceremony in the village of mödlareuth , which was once divided since it straddles the border between bavaria and thuringia , once states of west and east germany respectively .

" agreement has been reached and , god willing , we are heading for luxembourg , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gul told reporters in ankara , where his jet had been standing ready awaiting an accord . breakthrough after warning the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first-ever constitution in may and june . it also came as un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia was fully cooperating with her , a key demand for zagreb to start eu talks .
there is widespread speculation that croatia 's and turkey 's eu bids are linked . the talks have been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join , diplomats say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul , left , with german foreign minister joschka fischer in 2004 the eu was forced to postpone a planned ceremony monday afternoon to formally open the talks with turkey , whose foreign minister abdullah gul remained in ankara pending confirmation of an accord . it was assumed that the signing ceremony would be taking place later monday in luxembourg . knocking at the door after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , eu leaders meeting in december gave the vast predominantly muslim country a date of october 3 to start membership talks . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognize eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . it remained unclear late monday what exact wording was finally agreed for the negotiating framework . the latest draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
austria wanted that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan leaves a meeting with his ministers in kizilcahamam near the capital ankara on monday , oct .

british foreign secretary jack straw said monday crisis talks between the eu foreign ministers over admitting turkey to the european union were in trouble and start of entry talks with ankara later in the day were quietly postponed .
erdogan said he maintained " hope until the last minute " that eu leaders would overcome the deadlock .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , had urged the eu to show good sense before the accord was struck . " if the eu wants to become a global power , if it aims to eliminate the conflict of civilizations , the concert of civilizations must be achieved , " he said . the eu has long underlined that the fact of starting membership negotiations does not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
in any case the talks are likely to take at least a decade , during which turkey will have to bring comply with a succession of " chapters , " or eu policy areas , forcing it to come meet eu standards . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him . schröder said before a meeting of his social democrats that he would accept any decision his party made on whether he should continue to fight conservative rival angela merkel to claim a third term as german leader .
" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .
18 , schröder has insisted that the knife-edge result showed that voters were uncomfortable with the idea of merkel as chancellor after months in which she was flying high in the polls . bildunterschrift : schröder , left , and the spd chairman franz müntefering he said the social democrats ' come-from-behind result to near parity with the christian democrats showed that germans wanted him as their leader , even if his seven-year coalition with the greens had been voted out . he had vowed on election night that he would not let his party join any government led by angela merkel , the leader of the conservative christian democrats . however , the statements by schröder on monday seemed to confirm speculation that the spd was using the chancellor as a bargaining chip to gain leverage in possible talks about any " grand coalition , " which are sure to be contentious . in fact , spd chairman franz müntefering had earlier signaled a willingness for compromise over the chancellor question .
he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .
he said the party had no plans to dump him and would hold their ground , at least until coalition negotiations formally begin . " that is the basis upon which we will enter the negotiations , " he said . cdu wants " productive " talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel , speaks to her audience during an election campaign event in the city of dresden , eastern germany , friday , sept .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .

the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

" thousands of victims could have been avoided if merck had acted responsibly , " berlin attorney andreas schulz , who is representing 1,042 people who claim to have suffered severe side effects from vioxx , told the newspaper .
he said that merck should have taken vioxx off the market one year before it did , due to what he said was already clear evidence that the product could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
schulz said he hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with merck , which is facing a deluge of lawsuits over vioxx .

in the central ceremony in potsdam , politicians praised the accomplishments of the " peaceful revolution " in east germany . the main ceremony is being held in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
there president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , christian democratic leader angela merkel and other top political figures are attending the commemorative events . potsdam , which is the capital of the state of brandenburg , was chosen to host the central ceremony because that state now has the chairmanship of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . wolfgang thierse , social democratic parliamentarian and president of the bundestag , praised german reunification as a result " achieved with difficulty " of the peaceful revolution that took place in 1989 in the german democratic republic , or east germany .
he described the downfall of the east german dictatorship as a " happy chapter " of german history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , left , and the social democratic chairman , franz müntefering , right , smile together prior to the start of the celebrations for the 15th anniversary of german reunification in potsdam .
in reference to germany 's current difficult times - economic stagnation , particularly in the east , political uncertainty after inconclusive federal elections , and contentious debates about reforming welfare and labor laws - he reminded those in attendance that one should not forget that the euphoria of large accomplishments are often followed by more sober periods and " laborious small steps . " matthias platzeck , premier of brandenburg and another social democrat , warned of " exaggerated pessimism " when looking at the previous 15 years of unity .
he admitted that there had been mistakes in the process , but said one should not lose sight of the positive things that had been accomplished . unlike , for example , independence day celebrations in the united states or bastille day events in france , there was little flag waving or outbreaks of national pride in germany on monday .
it was instead a rather sober day of discussion and looking back .
that is partly to do with germans ' general reticence to ever wave a national flag , partly due to the insecurity over the current state of the nation and mixed feelings about whether the country is better off today than it was a decade and a half ago . church service the series of events began with an ecumenical service in potsdam 's nicholaikirche .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , emphasized in his sermon that the controversial reforms now being undertaken in germany , and seen with much trepidation particularly in the eastern part of the country , would find more acceptance if they were made in the " spirit of social justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber , left , and georg sterzinsky , bischop of berlin berlin 's archbishop georg sterzinsky , who also spoke at the religious service , said much had changed for the better in the past 15 years , but that unification had also give rise to new worries , such as fear of unemployment .
those emotions , he said , had to be taken seriously . later monday evening helmut kohl , chancellor at the time of reunification , will be awarded the quadriga prize , an award that recognizes people who have set outstanding examples in the political , social or economic fields .
former soviet president mikhail gorbachev will give a speech in kohl 's honor .

he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .

" that is the basis upon which we will enter the negotiations , " he said . cdu wants " productive " talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel , speaks to her audience during an election campaign event in the city of dresden , eastern germany , friday , sept .

" the two parties were to meet wednesday for a third round of talks on whether to begin formal negotiations on a grand coalition . after attending a german unification day event in potsdam , merkel said she was optimistic that sunday 's final chapter , with the election in dresden , would pave the way for productive talks . " it 's a good result for the cdu and i 'm counting on forces of reason in the spd to come forward now so that things can proceed in an orderly manner , " merkel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel increases leverage in dresden vote in dresden , germany 's final district to vote , angela merkel 's conservatives extended their lead over gerhard schröder 's social democrats , giving her the edge in the power struggle over who should become chancellor .

andreas lämmel led with 37 percent , while marlies volkmer of the spd received 32.1 percent . after the inconclusive general election on sept .
18 , the new results mean that the cdu will hold 226 seats in the bundestag versus 222 for the spd . cdu candidate lämmel said the voters had sent a clear signal to berlin , and specifically the german chancellor . " what this means for gerhard schröder is that it 's time for him to pack his bags and move back to hanover , " he said . " we will definitely begin a new round of exploratory talks with the spd on wednesday , " agreed cdu general secretary volker kauder .
" i think progress will be made . "
he also stressed that were schröder to back down , the talks would be far likely to reach a speedier conclusion .
" we expect the spd to see sense , " he said .
" the results in dresden obviously strengthen angela merkel 's position and send a clear signal to the spd .

andreas lämmel led with 37 percent , while marlies volkmer of the spd received 32.1 percent . after the inconclusive general election on sept .
18 , the new results mean that the cdu will hold 226 seats in the bundestag versus 222 for the spd . cdu candidate lämmel said the voters had sent a clear signal to berlin , and specifically the german chancellor . " what this means for gerhard schröder is that it 's time for him to pack his bags and move back to hanover , " he said . " we will definitely begin a new round of exploratory talks with the spd on wednesday , " agreed cdu general secretary volker kauder .
" i think progress will be made . "
he also stressed that were schröder to back down , the talks would be far likely to reach a speedier conclusion .
" we expect the spd to see sense , " he said .
" the results in dresden obviously strengthen angela merkel 's position and send a clear signal to the spd . " spd stands firm germany held its general election two weeks ago but the vote was postponed in dresden 's first district due to the death of a candidate from the neo-nazi npd party . cdu leader angela merkel , aiming to become the germany 's first female chancellor , is expected to exploit the gains in the bitter power struggle that ensued after both she and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder claimed to have a mandate to lead the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german social democratic party candidate marlies volkmer , left , watches with a canvasser the announcement of the first election results in the city hall in dresden , eastern germany , on sunday , oct .
2 , 2005 .
despite the inevitable disappointment , the social democrats were n't despairing after sunday 's poll .
while their candidate was n't directly elected , they won most of the second ballots that german voters place for a party , rather than the local contender . " if the spd is the strongest party in dresden , then that strengthens the party nationally as well - in the initial coalition talks and the later negotiations , " stressed marlies volkmer . spd leader franz müntefering agreed .
" we remain the strongest party , " he said , " while the cdu / csu remain the strongest parliamentary group . " impasse to end ? the country has been at a political impasse since the september poll , with both schröder and merkel claiming a mandate due to the knife-edge result .
while the outcome of the dresden vote does n't significantly alter that result , germans expect it will give the conservatives a psychological edge heading into the next round of coalition talks . bildunterschrift : angela merkel now has the psychological edge over gerhard schröder in the race for the chancellorship some 219,000 registered voters in dresden were called to the polls to decide the final make-up of the bundestag , with three seats at stake .
more than 72 percent of eligible voters had cast ballots , election officials said after the polls closed at 6:00 p.m. high voter turnout the high turnout reflected how seriously dresden residents took the election .
on friday , around 5,000 people showed up at a final campaign rally held by the spd , while almost 1,000 attended a simultaneous event held by the cdu .
but while it looked then as though schröder had the lead , sunday 's result told a different story . roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , said the vote confirmed the cdu and their bavarian sister party , the csu , as the strongest bloc in parliament , and said that it should choose the next chancellor . spd chairman franz müntefering stuck to the course of the past two weeks , saying the dresden result would not have any effect on the coalition talks with the cdu and csu .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany .

he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .

in the central ceremony in potsdam , politicians praised the accomplishments of the " peaceful revolution " in east germany . the main ceremony is being held in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
there president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , christian democratic leader angela merkel and other top political figures are attending the commemorative events . potsdam , which is the capital of the state of brandenburg , was chosen to host the central ceremony because that state now has the chairmanship of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . wolfgang thierse , social democratic parliamentarian and president of the bundestag , praised german reunification as a result " achieved with difficulty " of the peaceful revolution that took place in 1989 in the german democratic republic , or east germany .

" matthias platzeck , premier of brandenburg and another social democrat , warned of " exaggerated pessimism " when looking at the previous 15 years of unity .
he admitted that there had been mistakes in the process , but said one should not lose sight of the positive things that had been accomplished . unlike , for example , independence day celebrations in the united states or bastille day events in france , there was little flag waving or outbreaks of national pride in germany on monday .
it was instead a rather sober day of discussion and looking back .
that is partly to do with germans ' general reticence to ever wave a national flag , partly due to the insecurity over the current state of the nation and mixed feelings about whether the country is better off today than it was a decade and a half ago . church service the series of events began with an ecumenical service in potsdam 's nicholaikirche .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , emphasized in his sermon that the controversial reforms now being undertaken in germany , and seen with much trepidation particularly in the eastern part of the country , would find more acceptance if they were made in the " spirit of social justice .

those emotions , he said , had to be taken seriously . later monday evening helmut kohl , chancellor at the time of reunification , will be awarded the quadriga prize , an award that recognizes people who have set outstanding examples in the political , social or economic fields .

in the central ceremony in potsdam , politicians praised the accomplishments of the " peaceful revolution " in east germany . the main ceremony is being held in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
there president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , christian democratic leader angela merkel and other top political figures are attending the commemorative events . potsdam , which is the capital of the state of brandenburg , was chosen to host the central ceremony because that state now has the chairmanship of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . wolfgang thierse , social democratic parliamentarian and president of the bundestag , praised german reunification as a result " achieved with difficulty " of the peaceful revolution that took place in 1989 in the german democratic republic , or east germany .
he described the downfall of the east german dictatorship as a " happy chapter " of german history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , left , and the social democratic chairman , franz müntefering , right , smile together prior to the start of the celebrations for the 15th anniversary of german reunification in potsdam .
in reference to germany 's current difficult times - economic stagnation , particularly in the east , political uncertainty after inconclusive federal elections , and contentious debates about reforming welfare and labor laws - he reminded those in attendance that one should not forget that the euphoria of large accomplishments are often followed by more sober periods and " laborious small steps . " matthias platzeck , premier of brandenburg and another social democrat , warned of " exaggerated pessimism " when looking at the previous 15 years of unity .
he admitted that there had been mistakes in the process , but said one should not lose sight of the positive things that had been accomplished . unlike , for example , independence day celebrations in the united states or bastille day events in france , there was little flag waving or outbreaks of national pride in germany on monday .
it was instead a rather sober day of discussion and looking back .
that is partly to do with germans ' general reticence to ever wave a national flag , partly due to the insecurity over the current state of the nation and mixed feelings about whether the country is better off today than it was a decade and a half ago . church service the series of events began with an ecumenical service in potsdam 's nicholaikirche .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , emphasized in his sermon that the controversial reforms now being undertaken in germany , and seen with much trepidation particularly in the eastern part of the country , would find more acceptance if they were made in the " spirit of social justice .

those emotions , he said , had to be taken seriously . later monday evening helmut kohl , chancellor at the time of reunification , will be awarded the quadriga prize , an award that recognizes people who have set outstanding examples in the political , social or economic fields .

germany 's bild am sonntag said the first german patients would add their names to the suit against merck on monday in chicago , accusing the company of continuing to sell vioxx even after grave concerns about the drug arose .
" thousands of victims could have been avoided if merck had acted responsibly , " berlin attorney andreas schulz , who is representing 1,042 people who claim to have suffered severe side effects from vioxx , told the newspaper .
he said that merck should have taken vioxx off the market one year before it did , due to what he said was already clear evidence that the product could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
schulz said he hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with merck , which is facing a deluge of lawsuits over vioxx .
a texas jury in august awarded damages totaling more than 253 million dollars to carol ernst , whose 59-year-old triathlete husband , robert , died in may 2001 from heart failure after using vioxx to treat pain in his hands .
merck has been bombarded with lawsuits around the world since it pulled the $ 2.5-billion-a-year -lrb- 2.1 billion euro -rrb- seller vioxx from the market in september 2004 after an internal study showed it increased the risk of strokes and heart attacks .

" thousands of victims could have been avoided if merck had acted responsibly , " berlin attorney andreas schulz , who is representing 1,042 people who claim to have suffered severe side effects from vioxx , told the newspaper .
he said that merck should have taken vioxx off the market one year before it did , due to what he said was already clear evidence that the product could increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes .
schulz said he hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with merck , which is facing a deluge of lawsuits over vioxx .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .

he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .

she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .

many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2005 turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's plassnik -lrb- r -rrb- wants an alternative to turkey 's membership with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance . even us secretary of state condoleezza rice has intervened in a bid to salvage turkey 's european union membership talks .
rice allegedly spoke by telephone with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , telling him that the eu 's proposed negotiating framework for the talks would not impinge on nato .
the call came after turkey cemented the existing deadlock by objecting to a clause stipulating that it could not block eu members joining international organizations and treaties , which turkish hardliners argue could prevent ankara blocking a divided cyprus from joining nato . the initial start to the eu-turkey talks has already been postponed by british foreign secretary jack straw , on behalf of eu president britain , who said early monday that he was not certain a deal could be struck . " i hope that we are able to make progress but i can not say for certain that we will be able to make progress , " he told reporters . austrian intransigence austria is the country digging its heels in most firmly , refusing to agree to a mandate for the negotiations unless an alternative to full eu membership for the muslim country is offered .
" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .
some cited opposition to turkey 's eu hopes as a reason for voting no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey has brought two europes face to face , " commented turkish newspaper vatan monday .
" a europe that looks to a future of absolute peace by ending religious diaparity and conflict , and a europe that seeks to preserve its religious identity with xenophobia and racist , nationalistic fundamentalism .

" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .
some cited opposition to turkey 's eu hopes as a reason for voting no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey has brought two europes face to face , " commented turkish newspaper vatan monday .
" a europe that looks to a future of absolute peace by ending religious diaparity and conflict , and a europe that seeks to preserve its religious identity with xenophobia and racist , nationalistic fundamentalism . " " very little progress " austria 's plassnik , arriving for a bilateral meeting with straw ahead of the resumed eu talks , said there could still be a deal , even though admitting that " very little progress " had been made so far . " we have n't yet given up hope , " she told reporters .
" we need to move towards each other , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jack straw plassnik refused to bow under the pressure of being confronted by all her fellow european union members . " we are not afraid of difficult situations , " she told reporters after another round of talks with straw .
" there are limits , and we are about to explore them now . " turkey threatens to turn its back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül in ankara , turkish foreign minister abdullah gül huddled with his advisors awaiting news that never came that austria had ceded ground .
despite its eu ambitions , turkey has threatened to turn its back if vienna gets its way . after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , the vast , predominantly muslim country was given a date of oct .
3 to start talks by eu leaders in december . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognise eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . the present dispute focuses on the wording of the " negotiating framework " for the accession talks - essentially their guiding procedures and principles - which austria wants to refer to something other than full membership . eu - a christian club ? but it is difficult to see exactly what change of wording is needed . the current draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says that eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
vienna would like that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the new eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , warned the eu against being a " christian club " by refusing to start the talks . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player ... or it will limit itself to a christian club , " he said . the croatian factor one unknown factor is exactly how much stock austria puts in neighboring croatia being given the green light on monday to start its own delayed talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croation war crimes suspect ante gotovina croatia was originally to have started eu entry talks in march , but its case has been held up by its lack of cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal , notably over a key war crimes suspect , fugitive general ante gotovina -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-dietrich genscher , who as german foreign minister was instrumental in croatia being internationally recognized as an independent state , argued in favor of the country joining the bloc .
" the admission of slovenia shows that it was advantageous for the slovenes but also for the current eu member states .
and the same thing holds true for croatia .
croatia has covered a remarkable path to democracy .
croatia fulfills the prerequisites for eu membership .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .

as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .

günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .
in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .

in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .

10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .

it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate .

after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .
oktober 1989 in ost-berlin mit dem sowjetischen staats- und parteichef michail gorbatschow -lrb- 2.v.l -rrb- dem ddr-staatsratsvorsitzenden und sed-generalsekretär erich honecker -lrb- 3.v.l. -rrb- , raissa gorbatschowa -lrb- hinter honecker -rrb- , die gattin des sowjetischen präsidenten und willi stoph -lrb- 2.v.r. -rrb- , ministerpräsident der ddr .
mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .

günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .
in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .
oktober 1989 in ost-berlin mit dem sowjetischen staats- und parteichef michail gorbatschow -lrb- 2.v.l -rrb- dem ddr-staatsratsvorsitzenden und sed-generalsekretär erich honecker -lrb- 3.v.l. -rrb- , raissa gorbatschowa -lrb- hinter honecker -rrb- , die gattin des sowjetischen präsidenten und willi stoph -lrb- 2.v.r. -rrb- , ministerpräsident der ddr .
mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .
november 1989 während einer pressekonferenz in ost-berlin -lrb- ddr -rrb- die öffnung der innerdeutschen grenze bekannt .
günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "

dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .

it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .

in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .

in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .
november 1989 während einer pressekonferenz in ost-berlin -lrb- ddr -rrb- die öffnung der innerdeutschen grenze bekannt .
günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .
in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .

that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .

10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .

in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .

dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .

in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .

in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .

in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .
oktober 1989 in ost-berlin mit dem sowjetischen staats- und parteichef michail gorbatschow -lrb- 2.v.l -rrb- dem ddr-staatsratsvorsitzenden und sed-generalsekretär erich honecker -lrb- 3.v.l. -rrb- , raissa gorbatschowa -lrb- hinter honecker -rrb- , die gattin des sowjetischen präsidenten und willi stoph -lrb- 2.v.r. -rrb- , ministerpräsident der ddr .
mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .

günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .
in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

" agreement has been reached and , god willing , we are heading for luxembourg , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gul told reporters in ankara , where his jet had been standing ready awaiting an accord . breakthrough after warning the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first-ever constitution in may and june . it also came as un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia was fully cooperating with her , a key demand for zagreb to start eu talks .
there is widespread speculation that croatia 's and turkey 's eu bids are linked . the talks have been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join , diplomats say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul , left , with german foreign minister joschka fischer in 2004 the eu was forced to postpone a planned ceremony monday afternoon to formally open the talks with turkey , whose foreign minister abdullah gul remained in ankara pending confirmation of an accord . it was assumed that the signing ceremony would be taking place later monday in luxembourg . knocking at the door after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , eu leaders meeting in december gave the vast predominantly muslim country a date of october 3 to start membership talks . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognize eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . it remained unclear late monday what exact wording was finally agreed for the negotiating framework . the latest draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
austria wanted that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan leaves a meeting with his ministers in kizilcahamam near the capital ankara on monday , oct .

british foreign secretary jack straw said monday crisis talks between the eu foreign ministers over admitting turkey to the european union were in trouble and start of entry talks with ankara later in the day were quietly postponed .
erdogan said he maintained " hope until the last minute " that eu leaders would overcome the deadlock .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , had urged the eu to show good sense before the accord was struck . " if the eu wants to become a global power , if it aims to eliminate the conflict of civilizations , the concert of civilizations must be achieved , " he said . the eu has long underlined that the fact of starting membership negotiations does not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
in any case the talks are likely to take at least a decade , during which turkey will have to bring comply with a succession of " chapters , " or eu policy areas , forcing it to come meet eu standards . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him . schröder said before a meeting of his social democrats that he would accept any decision his party made on whether he should continue to fight conservative rival angela merkel to claim a third term as german leader .
" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .
18 , schröder has insisted that the knife-edge result showed that voters were uncomfortable with the idea of merkel as chancellor after months in which she was flying high in the polls . bildunterschrift : schröder , left , and the spd chairman franz müntefering he said the social democrats ' come-from-behind result to near parity with the christian democrats showed that germans wanted him as their leader , even if his seven-year coalition with the greens had been voted out . he had vowed on election night that he would not let his party join any government led by angela merkel , the leader of the conservative christian democrats . however , the statements by schröder on monday seemed to confirm speculation that the spd was using the chancellor as a bargaining chip to gain leverage in possible talks about any " grand coalition , " which are sure to be contentious . in fact , spd chairman franz müntefering had earlier signaled a willingness for compromise over the chancellor question .
he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .
he said the party had no plans to dump him and would hold their ground , at least until coalition negotiations formally begin .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him . schröder said before a meeting of his social democrats that he would accept any decision his party made on whether he should continue to fight conservative rival angela merkel to claim a third term as german leader .
" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .

he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .

" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .
18 , schröder has insisted that the knife-edge result showed that voters were uncomfortable with the idea of merkel as chancellor after months in which she was flying high in the polls . bildunterschrift : schröder , left , and the spd chairman franz müntefering he said the social democrats ' come-from-behind result to near parity with the christian democrats showed that germans wanted him as their leader , even if his seven-year coalition with the greens had been voted out . he had vowed on election night that he would not let his party join any government led by angela merkel , the leader of the conservative christian democrats . however , the statements by schröder on monday seemed to confirm speculation that the spd was using the chancellor as a bargaining chip to gain leverage in possible talks about any " grand coalition , " which are sure to be contentious . in fact , spd chairman franz müntefering had earlier signaled a willingness for compromise over the chancellor question .
he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .
he said the party had no plans to dump him and would hold their ground , at least until coalition negotiations formally begin . " that is the basis upon which we will enter the negotiations , " he said . cdu wants " productive " talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel , speaks to her audience during an election campaign event in the city of dresden , eastern germany , friday , sept .

" the two parties were to meet wednesday for a third round of talks on whether to begin formal negotiations on a grand coalition . after attending a german unification day event in potsdam , merkel said she was optimistic that sunday 's final chapter , with the election in dresden , would pave the way for productive talks . " it 's a good result for the cdu and i 'm counting on forces of reason in the spd to come forward now so that things can proceed in an orderly manner , " merkel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel increases leverage in dresden vote in dresden , germany 's final district to vote , angela merkel 's conservatives extended their lead over gerhard schröder 's social democrats , giving her the edge in the power struggle over who should become chancellor .

but after 40 years of separation , how could the differences have been leveled out any more quickly ? former chancellor helmut kohl promised " flourishing landscapes " 15 years ago , when german unification was implemented .
but such high-flying expectations evaporated long ago ; the outcome is sobering .
it can be seen in the emigration statistics that show that , every year , more people leave germany 's east for the country 's west than vice versa .
since german unification , on oct .
3 , 1990 , nearly 1 million people have turned their backs on eastern germany . that ca n't be merely glossed over .
it brings to light a problem linked to unification that 's been suppressed : above all , eastern germany is losing young people because they see few prospects on the job market .
the cities and towns are becoming ever emptier ; the education level is falling ; tax income in eastern german states and municipalities is dropping and qualified personnel is lacking all over .
nowhere in germany are fewer babies born than in the " new " eastern states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2005 turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's plassnik -lrb- r -rrb- wants an alternative to turkey 's membership with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance . even us secretary of state condoleezza rice has intervened in a bid to salvage turkey 's european union membership talks .
rice allegedly spoke by telephone with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , telling him that the eu 's proposed negotiating framework for the talks would not impinge on nato .
the call came after turkey cemented the existing deadlock by objecting to a clause stipulating that it could not block eu members joining international organizations and treaties , which turkish hardliners argue could prevent ankara blocking a divided cyprus from joining nato . the initial start to the eu-turkey talks has already been postponed by british foreign secretary jack straw , on behalf of eu president britain , who said early monday that he was not certain a deal could be struck . " i hope that we are able to make progress but i can not say for certain that we will be able to make progress , " he told reporters . austrian intransigence austria is the country digging its heels in most firmly , refusing to agree to a mandate for the negotiations unless an alternative to full eu membership for the muslim country is offered .
" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .
some cited opposition to turkey 's eu hopes as a reason for voting no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey has brought two europes face to face , " commented turkish newspaper vatan monday .
" a europe that looks to a future of absolute peace by ending religious diaparity and conflict , and a europe that seeks to preserve its religious identity with xenophobia and racist , nationalistic fundamentalism . " " very little progress " austria 's plassnik , arriving for a bilateral meeting with straw ahead of the resumed eu talks , said there could still be a deal , even though admitting that " very little progress " had been made so far . " we have n't yet given up hope , " she told reporters .
" we need to move towards each other , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jack straw plassnik refused to bow under the pressure of being confronted by all her fellow european union members . " we are not afraid of difficult situations , " she told reporters after another round of talks with straw .
" there are limits , and we are about to explore them now . " turkey threatens to turn its back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül in ankara , turkish foreign minister abdullah gül huddled with his advisors awaiting news that never came that austria had ceded ground .
despite its eu ambitions , turkey has threatened to turn its back if vienna gets its way . after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , the vast , predominantly muslim country was given a date of oct .
3 to start talks by eu leaders in december . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognise eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . the present dispute focuses on the wording of the " negotiating framework " for the accession talks - essentially their guiding procedures and principles - which austria wants to refer to something other than full membership . eu - a christian club ? but it is difficult to see exactly what change of wording is needed . the current draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says that eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
vienna would like that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the new eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , warned the eu against being a " christian club " by refusing to start the talks . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player ... or it will limit itself to a christian club , " he said . the croatian factor one unknown factor is exactly how much stock austria puts in neighboring croatia being given the green light on monday to start its own delayed talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croation war crimes suspect ante gotovina croatia was originally to have started eu entry talks in march , but its case has been held up by its lack of cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal , notably over a key war crimes suspect , fugitive general ante gotovina -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-dietrich genscher , who as german foreign minister was instrumental in croatia being internationally recognized as an independent state , argued in favor of the country joining the bloc .
" the admission of slovenia shows that it was advantageous for the slovenes but also for the current eu member states .
and the same thing holds true for croatia .
croatia has covered a remarkable path to democracy .
croatia fulfills the prerequisites for eu membership .

rice allegedly spoke by telephone with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , telling him that the eu 's proposed negotiating framework for the talks would not impinge on nato .
the call came after turkey cemented the existing deadlock by objecting to a clause stipulating that it could not block eu members joining international organizations and treaties , which turkish hardliners argue could prevent ankara blocking a divided cyprus from joining nato . the initial start to the eu-turkey talks has already been postponed by british foreign secretary jack straw , on behalf of eu president britain , who said early monday that he was not certain a deal could be struck . " i hope that we are able to make progress but i can not say for certain that we will be able to make progress , " he told reporters . austrian intransigence austria is the country digging its heels in most firmly , refusing to agree to a mandate for the negotiations unless an alternative to full eu membership for the muslim country is offered .
" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .
some cited opposition to turkey 's eu hopes as a reason for voting no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey has brought two europes face to face , " commented turkish newspaper vatan monday .
" a europe that looks to a future of absolute peace by ending religious diaparity and conflict , and a europe that seeks to preserve its religious identity with xenophobia and racist , nationalistic fundamentalism . " " very little progress " austria 's plassnik , arriving for a bilateral meeting with straw ahead of the resumed eu talks , said there could still be a deal , even though admitting that " very little progress " had been made so far . " we have n't yet given up hope , " she told reporters .
" we need to move towards each other , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jack straw plassnik refused to bow under the pressure of being confronted by all her fellow european union members .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

schulz said he hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with merck , which is facing a deluge of lawsuits over vioxx .

in the central ceremony in potsdam , politicians praised the accomplishments of the " peaceful revolution " in east germany . the main ceremony is being held in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
there president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , christian democratic leader angela merkel and other top political figures are attending the commemorative events . potsdam , which is the capital of the state of brandenburg , was chosen to host the central ceremony because that state now has the chairmanship of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . wolfgang thierse , social democratic parliamentarian and president of the bundestag , praised german reunification as a result " achieved with difficulty " of the peaceful revolution that took place in 1989 in the german democratic republic , or east germany .
he described the downfall of the east german dictatorship as a " happy chapter " of german history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , left , and the social democratic chairman , franz müntefering , right , smile together prior to the start of the celebrations for the 15th anniversary of german reunification in potsdam .
in reference to germany 's current difficult times - economic stagnation , particularly in the east , political uncertainty after inconclusive federal elections , and contentious debates about reforming welfare and labor laws - he reminded those in attendance that one should not forget that the euphoria of large accomplishments are often followed by more sober periods and " laborious small steps . " matthias platzeck , premier of brandenburg and another social democrat , warned of " exaggerated pessimism " when looking at the previous 15 years of unity .
he admitted that there had been mistakes in the process , but said one should not lose sight of the positive things that had been accomplished . unlike , for example , independence day celebrations in the united states or bastille day events in france , there was little flag waving or outbreaks of national pride in germany on monday .
it was instead a rather sober day of discussion and looking back .
that is partly to do with germans ' general reticence to ever wave a national flag , partly due to the insecurity over the current state of the nation and mixed feelings about whether the country is better off today than it was a decade and a half ago . church service the series of events began with an ecumenical service in potsdam 's nicholaikirche .

" agreement has been reached and , god willing , we are heading for luxembourg , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gul told reporters in ankara , where his jet had been standing ready awaiting an accord . breakthrough after warning the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first-ever constitution in may and june . it also came as un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia was fully cooperating with her , a key demand for zagreb to start eu talks .
there is widespread speculation that croatia 's and turkey 's eu bids are linked . the talks have been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join , diplomats say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul , left , with german foreign minister joschka fischer in 2004 the eu was forced to postpone a planned ceremony monday afternoon to formally open the talks with turkey , whose foreign minister abdullah gul remained in ankara pending confirmation of an accord . it was assumed that the signing ceremony would be taking place later monday in luxembourg . knocking at the door after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , eu leaders meeting in december gave the vast predominantly muslim country a date of october 3 to start membership talks . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognize eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . it remained unclear late monday what exact wording was finally agreed for the negotiating framework . the latest draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
austria wanted that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan leaves a meeting with his ministers in kizilcahamam near the capital ankara on monday , oct .

british foreign secretary jack straw said monday crisis talks between the eu foreign ministers over admitting turkey to the european union were in trouble and start of entry talks with ankara later in the day were quietly postponed .
erdogan said he maintained " hope until the last minute " that eu leaders would overcome the deadlock .
prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , had urged the eu to show good sense before the accord was struck . " if the eu wants to become a global power , if it aims to eliminate the conflict of civilizations , the concert of civilizations must be achieved , " he said . the eu has long underlined that the fact of starting membership negotiations does not guarantee that turkey will actually join .
in any case the talks are likely to take at least a decade , during which turkey will have to bring comply with a succession of " chapters , " or eu policy areas , forcing it to come meet eu standards . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .

as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .

they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .

die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .

" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .
in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .

in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .
oktober 1989 in ost-berlin mit dem sowjetischen staats- und parteichef michail gorbatschow -lrb- 2.v.l -rrb- dem ddr-staatsratsvorsitzenden und sed-generalsekretär erich honecker -lrb- 3.v.l. -rrb- , raissa gorbatschowa -lrb- hinter honecker -rrb- , die gattin des sowjetischen präsidenten und willi stoph -lrb- 2.v.r. -rrb- , ministerpräsident der ddr .
mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .
oktober 1989 in ost-berlin mit dem sowjetischen staats- und parteichef michail gorbatschow -lrb- 2.v.l -rrb- dem ddr-staatsratsvorsitzenden und sed-generalsekretär erich honecker -lrb- 3.v.l. -rrb- , raissa gorbatschowa -lrb- hinter honecker -rrb- , die gattin des sowjetischen präsidenten und willi stoph -lrb- 2.v.r. -rrb- , ministerpräsident der ddr .
mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .
november 1989 während einer pressekonferenz in ost-berlin -lrb- ddr -rrb- die öffnung der innerdeutschen grenze bekannt .
günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him . schröder said before a meeting of his social democrats that he would accept any decision his party made on whether he should continue to fight conservative rival angela merkel to claim a third term as german leader .
" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .
18 , schröder has insisted that the knife-edge result showed that voters were uncomfortable with the idea of merkel as chancellor after months in which she was flying high in the polls . bildunterschrift : schröder , left , and the spd chairman franz müntefering he said the social democrats ' come-from-behind result to near parity with the christian democrats showed that germans wanted him as their leader , even if his seven-year coalition with the greens had been voted out . he had vowed on election night that he would not let his party join any government led by angela merkel , the leader of the conservative christian democrats . however , the statements by schröder on monday seemed to confirm speculation that the spd was using the chancellor as a bargaining chip to gain leverage in possible talks about any " grand coalition , " which are sure to be contentious . in fact , spd chairman franz müntefering had earlier signaled a willingness for compromise over the chancellor question .
he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .
he said the party had no plans to dump him and would hold their ground , at least until coalition negotiations formally begin . " that is the basis upon which we will enter the negotiations , " he said . cdu wants " productive " talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel , speaks to her audience during an election campaign event in the city of dresden , eastern germany , friday , sept .

" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge europe -pipe- 03.10.2005 opinion : germany must accept differences großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the unification ethos says life in east and west should be similar instead of being proud of what they 've achieved in 15 years of unification , germany 's mood is dominated by discontent .
but after 40 years of separation , how could the differences have been leveled out any more quickly ? former chancellor helmut kohl promised " flourishing landscapes " 15 years ago , when german unification was implemented .
but such high-flying expectations evaporated long ago ; the outcome is sobering .
it can be seen in the emigration statistics that show that , every year , more people leave germany 's east for the country 's west than vice versa .
since german unification , on oct .
3 , 1990 , nearly 1 million people have turned their backs on eastern germany . that ca n't be merely glossed over .
it brings to light a problem linked to unification that 's been suppressed : above all , eastern germany is losing young people because they see few prospects on the job market .
the cities and towns are becoming ever emptier ; the education level is falling ; tax income in eastern german states and municipalities is dropping and qualified personnel is lacking all over .
nowhere in germany are fewer babies born than in the " new " eastern states .
demographers have raised the alarm .
sacrifices on both sides instead of a " flourishing landscape , " eastern germany is still an immense construction site on which work is being done in a more or less hapless fashion .
the current situation certainly was n't caused by a deficit in solidarity .
every year around 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- are transferred from western to eastern germany , generous developmental aid that 's intended to continue until 2020 .
numerous economic experts see the transfers as a main cause for germany 's weak economy and high unemployment .
and these problems will continue to exist as long as eastern germany does n't stand on its own two feet economically . there 's no doubt that money for developing the east is needed .
the crucial issue , however , is how effectively the money is being used .
economists have long been demanding that politicians correct their approach and increasingly put the money in investments instead of financing unproductive consumption .
instead of continuing on the same route , we need a more open and unsparing analysis of what development is realistically possible .
concretely , how far should germany pursue the original aim of bringing living conditions in east and west into alignment ?
many politicians have avoided such a discussion so far - it could cost votes .
bildunterschrift : bmw in leipzig still divided of course , the outcome of the past 15 years has by no means been purely negative .
a lot has happened in germany 's east .
the infrastructure has been completely modernized ; city centers have to a large extent been restored ; in places such as leipzig , competitive industrial centers have been established .
for eastern germans modern cars , color tvs , refrigerators and vacations have become as much a matter of course as they have long been for western germans .
above all , the freedom they gained when the berlin wall fell is worth any sacrifice . but 15 years are hardly enough to seamlessly meld together a nation divided for 40 years .
that which divided them pales , but much more slowly than many people are willing to admit .
more than half of western germans see the eastern germans as unification 's profiteers and consider them unappreciative of the many sacrifices the westerners made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in jena , eastern germany , against welfare reform .

but after 40 years of separation , how could the differences have been leveled out any more quickly ? former chancellor helmut kohl promised " flourishing landscapes " 15 years ago , when german unification was implemented .
but such high-flying expectations evaporated long ago ; the outcome is sobering .
it can be seen in the emigration statistics that show that , every year , more people leave germany 's east for the country 's west than vice versa .
since german unification , on oct .
3 , 1990 , nearly 1 million people have turned their backs on eastern germany . that ca n't be merely glossed over .
it brings to light a problem linked to unification that 's been suppressed : above all , eastern germany is losing young people because they see few prospects on the job market .
the cities and towns are becoming ever emptier ; the education level is falling ; tax income in eastern german states and municipalities is dropping and qualified personnel is lacking all over .
nowhere in germany are fewer babies born than in the " new " eastern states .
demographers have raised the alarm .
sacrifices on both sides instead of a " flourishing landscape , " eastern germany is still an immense construction site on which work is being done in a more or less hapless fashion .
the current situation certainly was n't caused by a deficit in solidarity .
every year around 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- are transferred from western to eastern germany , generous developmental aid that 's intended to continue until 2020 .
numerous economic experts see the transfers as a main cause for germany 's weak economy and high unemployment .
and these problems will continue to exist as long as eastern germany does n't stand on its own two feet economically . there 's no doubt that money for developing the east is needed .
the crucial issue , however , is how effectively the money is being used .
economists have long been demanding that politicians correct their approach and increasingly put the money in investments instead of financing unproductive consumption .
instead of continuing on the same route , we need a more open and unsparing analysis of what development is realistically possible .
concretely , how far should germany pursue the original aim of bringing living conditions in east and west into alignment ?
many politicians have avoided such a discussion so far - it could cost votes .
bildunterschrift : bmw in leipzig still divided of course , the outcome of the past 15 years has by no means been purely negative .
a lot has happened in germany 's east .
the infrastructure has been completely modernized ; city centers have to a large extent been restored ; in places such as leipzig , competitive industrial centers have been established .
for eastern germans modern cars , color tvs , refrigerators and vacations have become as much a matter of course as they have long been for western germans .
above all , the freedom they gained when the berlin wall fell is worth any sacrifice . but 15 years are hardly enough to seamlessly meld together a nation divided for 40 years .
that which divided them pales , but much more slowly than many people are willing to admit .
more than half of western germans see the eastern germans as unification 's profiteers and consider them unappreciative of the many sacrifices the westerners made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in jena , eastern germany , against welfare reform .
the sign reads , " we are the poeple , " which was east germans ' rallying cry when the berlin wall fell .
on the other hand , more than a third of the people in the east think that those in the west have the upper hand when it comes to unification .
many of them feel patronized , that the west german model was simply imposed on them and even east germany 's positive aspects - the compatibility of family and work , for example - were abolished .
but germans do n't really like to talk about these sentiments in public because they fear it will fan the flames of envy between east and west , and that they will be labelled opponents of unification . but a bit more sangfroid would do the discussion good .
firstly , despite all the talk about unified germany 's situation , the overwhelming majority of germans , from east and west , view reunification positively .
secondly , it 's an illusion to think that 40 years of differing developments take place without leaving a trace on a country and its people .
why is it so difficult to accept that differences - in the way people think and feel as well as in people 's living conditions - exist ?
perhaps it 's because germany has n't yet prepared itself for such a possibility .

andreas lämmel led with 37 percent , while marlies volkmer of the spd received 32.1 percent . after the inconclusive general election on sept .
18 , the new results mean that the cdu will hold 226 seats in the bundestag versus 222 for the spd . cdu candidate lämmel said the voters had sent a clear signal to berlin , and specifically the german chancellor . " what this means for gerhard schröder is that it 's time for him to pack his bags and move back to hanover , " he said . " we will definitely begin a new round of exploratory talks with the spd on wednesday , " agreed cdu general secretary volker kauder .
" i think progress will be made . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2005 turkey brings eu to " edge of precipice " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : austria 's plassnik -lrb- r -rrb- wants an alternative to turkey 's membership with turkey raising new obstacles and austria holding out against an accord to clear the way for talks with ankara , the european union teetered on the brink of crisis monday , and turkey 's eu hopes hung in the balance . even us secretary of state condoleezza rice has intervened in a bid to salvage turkey 's european union membership talks .
rice allegedly spoke by telephone with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , telling him that the eu 's proposed negotiating framework for the talks would not impinge on nato .
the call came after turkey cemented the existing deadlock by objecting to a clause stipulating that it could not block eu members joining international organizations and treaties , which turkish hardliners argue could prevent ankara blocking a divided cyprus from joining nato . the initial start to the eu-turkey talks has already been postponed by british foreign secretary jack straw , on behalf of eu president britain , who said early monday that he was not certain a deal could be struck . " i hope that we are able to make progress but i can not say for certain that we will be able to make progress , " he told reporters . austrian intransigence austria is the country digging its heels in most firmly , refusing to agree to a mandate for the negotiations unless an alternative to full eu membership for the muslim country is offered .
" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .
some cited opposition to turkey 's eu hopes as a reason for voting no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey has brought two europes face to face , " commented turkish newspaper vatan monday .
" a europe that looks to a future of absolute peace by ending religious diaparity and conflict , and a europe that seeks to preserve its religious identity with xenophobia and racist , nationalistic fundamentalism . " " very little progress " austria 's plassnik , arriving for a bilateral meeting with straw ahead of the resumed eu talks , said there could still be a deal , even though admitting that " very little progress " had been made so far . " we have n't yet given up hope , " she told reporters .
" we need to move towards each other , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jack straw plassnik refused to bow under the pressure of being confronted by all her fellow european union members . " we are not afraid of difficult situations , " she told reporters after another round of talks with straw .
" there are limits , and we are about to explore them now . " turkey threatens to turn its back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül in ankara , turkish foreign minister abdullah gül huddled with his advisors awaiting news that never came that austria had ceded ground .
despite its eu ambitions , turkey has threatened to turn its back if vienna gets its way . after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , the vast , predominantly muslim country was given a date of oct .
3 to start talks by eu leaders in december . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognise eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . the present dispute focuses on the wording of the " negotiating framework " for the accession talks - essentially their guiding procedures and principles - which austria wants to refer to something other than full membership . eu - a christian club ? but it is difficult to see exactly what change of wording is needed . the current draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says that eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
vienna would like that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the new eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , warned the eu against being a " christian club " by refusing to start the talks . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player ... or it will limit itself to a christian club , " he said . the croatian factor one unknown factor is exactly how much stock austria puts in neighboring croatia being given the green light on monday to start its own delayed talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croation war crimes suspect ante gotovina croatia was originally to have started eu entry talks in march , but its case has been held up by its lack of cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal , notably over a key war crimes suspect , fugitive general ante gotovina -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-dietrich genscher , who as german foreign minister was instrumental in croatia being internationally recognized as an independent state , argued in favor of the country joining the bloc .
" the admission of slovenia shows that it was advantageous for the slovenes but also for the current eu member states .
and the same thing holds true for croatia .
croatia has covered a remarkable path to democracy .
croatia fulfills the prerequisites for eu membership . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey challenges eu to be " world player " turkey 's prime minister challenged the european union on sunday to be a " world player " rather than a " christian club , " as the bloc deliberated whether to open formal membership talks with the largely muslim country .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .

the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .

but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

" behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

schulz said he hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with merck , which is facing a deluge of lawsuits over vioxx .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .

the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .

the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .

the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .

the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .

mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .

januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .

as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .

they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .

die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .

talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .

dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .
oktober 1989 in ost-berlin mit dem sowjetischen staats- und parteichef michail gorbatschow -lrb- 2.v.l -rrb- dem ddr-staatsratsvorsitzenden und sed-generalsekretär erich honecker -lrb- 3.v.l. -rrb- , raissa gorbatschowa -lrb- hinter honecker -rrb- , die gattin des sowjetischen präsidenten und willi stoph -lrb- 2.v.r. -rrb- , ministerpräsident der ddr .
mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .
november 1989 während einer pressekonferenz in ost-berlin -lrb- ddr -rrb- die öffnung der innerdeutschen grenze bekannt .
günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .
in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .
that depends solely on the actions of each and every one of us .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .
oktober 1989 in ost-berlin mit dem sowjetischen staats- und parteichef michail gorbatschow -lrb- 2.v.l -rrb- dem ddr-staatsratsvorsitzenden und sed-generalsekretär erich honecker -lrb- 3.v.l. -rrb- , raissa gorbatschowa -lrb- hinter honecker -rrb- , die gattin des sowjetischen präsidenten und willi stoph -lrb- 2.v.r. -rrb- , ministerpräsident der ddr .
mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .

günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .
in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .

as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .

" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .

the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

" behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

schulz said he hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with merck , which is facing a deluge of lawsuits over vioxx .

andreas lämmel led with 37 percent , while marlies volkmer of the spd received 32.1 percent . after the inconclusive general election on sept .
18 , the new results mean that the cdu will hold 226 seats in the bundestag versus 222 for the spd . cdu candidate lämmel said the voters had sent a clear signal to berlin , and specifically the german chancellor . " what this means for gerhard schröder is that it 's time for him to pack his bags and move back to hanover , " he said . " we will definitely begin a new round of exploratory talks with the spd on wednesday , " agreed cdu general secretary volker kauder .
" i think progress will be made . "
he also stressed that were schröder to back down , the talks would be far likely to reach a speedier conclusion .
" we expect the spd to see sense , " he said .
" the results in dresden obviously strengthen angela merkel 's position and send a clear signal to the spd . " spd stands firm germany held its general election two weeks ago but the vote was postponed in dresden 's first district due to the death of a candidate from the neo-nazi npd party . cdu leader angela merkel , aiming to become the germany 's first female chancellor , is expected to exploit the gains in the bitter power struggle that ensued after both she and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder claimed to have a mandate to lead the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german social democratic party candidate marlies volkmer , left , watches with a canvasser the announcement of the first election results in the city hall in dresden , eastern germany , on sunday , oct .
2 , 2005 .
despite the inevitable disappointment , the social democrats were n't despairing after sunday 's poll .
while their candidate was n't directly elected , they won most of the second ballots that german voters place for a party , rather than the local contender . " if the spd is the strongest party in dresden , then that strengthens the party nationally as well - in the initial coalition talks and the later negotiations , " stressed marlies volkmer . spd leader franz müntefering agreed .
" we remain the strongest party , " he said , " while the cdu / csu remain the strongest parliamentary group . " impasse to end ? the country has been at a political impasse since the september poll , with both schröder and merkel claiming a mandate due to the knife-edge result .
while the outcome of the dresden vote does n't significantly alter that result , germans expect it will give the conservatives a psychological edge heading into the next round of coalition talks . bildunterschrift : angela merkel now has the psychological edge over gerhard schröder in the race for the chancellorship some 219,000 registered voters in dresden were called to the polls to decide the final make-up of the bundestag , with three seats at stake .
more than 72 percent of eligible voters had cast ballots , election officials said after the polls closed at 6:00 p.m. high voter turnout the high turnout reflected how seriously dresden residents took the election .
on friday , around 5,000 people showed up at a final campaign rally held by the spd , while almost 1,000 attended a simultaneous event held by the cdu .
but while it looked then as though schröder had the lead , sunday 's result told a different story . roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , said the vote confirmed the cdu and their bavarian sister party , the csu , as the strongest bloc in parliament , and said that it should choose the next chancellor . spd chairman franz müntefering stuck to the course of the past two weeks , saying the dresden result would not have any effect on the coalition talks with the cdu and csu .
the spd 's party leaders will meet monday night , while the next round of coalition talks is scheduled for wednesday . dw staff -lrb- dc / jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cdu leading in early dresden results the conservative christian democrats were leading chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democrats sunday in the final district to vote in the german national election , preliminary results showed .

in the central ceremony in potsdam , politicians praised the accomplishments of the " peaceful revolution " in east germany . the main ceremony is being held in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
there president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , christian democratic leader angela merkel and other top political figures are attending the commemorative events . potsdam , which is the capital of the state of brandenburg , was chosen to host the central ceremony because that state now has the chairmanship of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . wolfgang thierse , social democratic parliamentarian and president of the bundestag , praised german reunification as a result " achieved with difficulty " of the peaceful revolution that took place in 1989 in the german democratic republic , or east germany .
he described the downfall of the east german dictatorship as a " happy chapter " of german history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , left , and the social democratic chairman , franz müntefering , right , smile together prior to the start of the celebrations for the 15th anniversary of german reunification in potsdam .
in reference to germany 's current difficult times - economic stagnation , particularly in the east , political uncertainty after inconclusive federal elections , and contentious debates about reforming welfare and labor laws - he reminded those in attendance that one should not forget that the euphoria of large accomplishments are often followed by more sober periods and " laborious small steps . " matthias platzeck , premier of brandenburg and another social democrat , warned of " exaggerated pessimism " when looking at the previous 15 years of unity .
he admitted that there had been mistakes in the process , but said one should not lose sight of the positive things that had been accomplished . unlike , for example , independence day celebrations in the united states or bastille day events in france , there was little flag waving or outbreaks of national pride in germany on monday .
it was instead a rather sober day of discussion and looking back .
that is partly to do with germans ' general reticence to ever wave a national flag , partly due to the insecurity over the current state of the nation and mixed feelings about whether the country is better off today than it was a decade and a half ago . church service the series of events began with an ecumenical service in potsdam 's nicholaikirche .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , emphasized in his sermon that the controversial reforms now being undertaken in germany , and seen with much trepidation particularly in the eastern part of the country , would find more acceptance if they were made in the " spirit of social justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber , left , and georg sterzinsky , bischop of berlin berlin 's archbishop georg sterzinsky , who also spoke at the religious service , said much had changed for the better in the past 15 years , but that unification had also give rise to new worries , such as fear of unemployment .
those emotions , he said , had to be taken seriously . later monday evening helmut kohl , chancellor at the time of reunification , will be awarded the quadriga prize , an award that recognizes people who have set outstanding examples in the political , social or economic fields .
former soviet president mikhail gorbachev will give a speech in kohl 's honor . " little berlin " several leaders of the union bloc of parties , the christian democratic union and the bavarian christian social union , will be on hand at a ceremony in the village of mödlareuth , which was once divided since it straddles the border between bavaria and thuringia , once states of west and east germany respectively .

but his party said it still wanted a third term for him . schröder said before a meeting of his social democrats that he would accept any decision his party made on whether he should continue to fight conservative rival angela merkel to claim a third term as german leader .
" this is not about my prerogatives and absolutely not about me as a person , " schröder told rtl television when asked about his and merkel 's competing claims to the chancellery . " it is about my party 's prerogative for political leadership .
i will accept any decision , " he said .
" i do not want to stand in the way of a development that allows the continuation of the -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms i initiated and the formation of a stable government in germany . " the social democrats were meeting after the final district in germany voted against them sunday in a delayed ballot for the inconclusive general election , widening the conservatives ' lead in parliament to four seats . the vote was expected to have a psychological impact on the parties amid exploratory talks on forming a left-right " grand coalition , " last seen in germany in the late 1960s , and primarily on the question of who should be chancellor . schröder adamant until now since election night on sept .
18 , schröder has insisted that the knife-edge result showed that voters were uncomfortable with the idea of merkel as chancellor after months in which she was flying high in the polls . bildunterschrift : schröder , left , and the spd chairman franz müntefering he said the social democrats ' come-from-behind result to near parity with the christian democrats showed that germans wanted him as their leader , even if his seven-year coalition with the greens had been voted out . he had vowed on election night that he would not let his party join any government led by angela merkel , the leader of the conservative christian democrats . however , the statements by schröder on monday seemed to confirm speculation that the spd was using the chancellor as a bargaining chip to gain leverage in possible talks about any " grand coalition , " which are sure to be contentious . in fact , spd chairman franz müntefering had earlier signaled a willingness for compromise over the chancellor question .
he said the social democrats wanted a " grand coalition " led by schröder , but that the demand was negotiable . but on monday evening , münterfering reiterated that the ultimate goal of the party was still to be part of a government led by schröder .
he said the party had no plans to dump him and would hold their ground , at least until coalition negotiations formally begin . " that is the basis upon which we will enter the negotiations , " he said . cdu wants " productive " talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor candidate and chairwoman of the german party christian democratic union , angela merkel , speaks to her audience during an election campaign event in the city of dresden , eastern germany , friday , sept .

" the two parties were to meet wednesday for a third round of talks on whether to begin formal negotiations on a grand coalition . after attending a german unification day event in potsdam , merkel said she was optimistic that sunday 's final chapter , with the election in dresden , would pave the way for productive talks . " it 's a good result for the cdu and i 'm counting on forces of reason in the spd to come forward now so that things can proceed in an orderly manner , " merkel said . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel increases leverage in dresden vote in dresden , germany 's final district to vote , angela merkel 's conservatives extended their lead over gerhard schröder 's social democrats , giving her the edge in the power struggle over who should become chancellor .

" agreement has been reached and , god willing , we are heading for luxembourg , " turkish foreign minister abdullah gul told reporters in ankara , where his jet had been standing ready awaiting an accord . breakthrough after warning the breakthrough came after straw warned that failure would prove " catastrophic " for the bloc , still in turmoil following french and dutch rejections of its first-ever constitution in may and june . it also came as un war crimes prosecutor carla del ponte said croatia was fully cooperating with her , a key demand for zagreb to start eu talks .
there is widespread speculation that croatia 's and turkey 's eu bids are linked . the talks have been blocked by austrian demands that the eu offer turkey something less than full membership as part of the so-called " negotiating framework " for the talks , which sets out their principles and logistics . vienna had also pushed for stronger language warning that the eu 's " absorption capacity " should be taken into account when assessing if turkey can join , diplomats say . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gul , left , with german foreign minister joschka fischer in 2004 the eu was forced to postpone a planned ceremony monday afternoon to formally open the talks with turkey , whose foreign minister abdullah gul remained in ankara pending confirmation of an accord . it was assumed that the signing ceremony would be taking place later monday in luxembourg . knocking at the door after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , eu leaders meeting in december gave the vast predominantly muslim country a date of october 3 to start membership talks . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognize eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . it remained unclear late monday what exact wording was finally agreed for the negotiating framework . the latest draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
austria wanted that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan leaves a meeting with his ministers in kizilcahamam near the capital ankara on monday , oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.10.2005 germany commemorates unification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parliamentary president thierse lauded the peaceful revolution in cities and towns across germany , the country is looking back on fifteen years of german unity .
in the central ceremony in potsdam , politicians praised the accomplishments of the " peaceful revolution " in east germany . the main ceremony is being held in potsdam , just outside of berlin .
there president horst köhler , chancellor gerhard schröder , christian democratic leader angela merkel and other top political figures are attending the commemorative events . potsdam , which is the capital of the state of brandenburg , was chosen to host the central ceremony because that state now has the chairmanship of the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . wolfgang thierse , social democratic parliamentarian and president of the bundestag , praised german reunification as a result " achieved with difficulty " of the peaceful revolution that took place in 1989 in the german democratic republic , or east germany .
he described the downfall of the east german dictatorship as a " happy chapter " of german history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , left , and the social democratic chairman , franz müntefering , right , smile together prior to the start of the celebrations for the 15th anniversary of german reunification in potsdam .
in reference to germany 's current difficult times - economic stagnation , particularly in the east , political uncertainty after inconclusive federal elections , and contentious debates about reforming welfare and labor laws - he reminded those in attendance that one should not forget that the euphoria of large accomplishments are often followed by more sober periods and " laborious small steps . " matthias platzeck , premier of brandenburg and another social democrat , warned of " exaggerated pessimism " when looking at the previous 15 years of unity .
he admitted that there had been mistakes in the process , but said one should not lose sight of the positive things that had been accomplished . unlike , for example , independence day celebrations in the united states or bastille day events in france , there was little flag waving or outbreaks of national pride in germany on monday .
it was instead a rather sober day of discussion and looking back .
that is partly to do with germans ' general reticence to ever wave a national flag , partly due to the insecurity over the current state of the nation and mixed feelings about whether the country is better off today than it was a decade and a half ago . church service the series of events began with an ecumenical service in potsdam 's nicholaikirche .
the head of the protestant church in germany , wolfgang huber , emphasized in his sermon that the controversial reforms now being undertaken in germany , and seen with much trepidation particularly in the eastern part of the country , would find more acceptance if they were made in the " spirit of social justice . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bishop wolfgang huber , left , and georg sterzinsky , bischop of berlin berlin 's archbishop georg sterzinsky , who also spoke at the religious service , said much had changed for the better in the past 15 years , but that unification had also give rise to new worries , such as fear of unemployment .
those emotions , he said , had to be taken seriously . later monday evening helmut kohl , chancellor at the time of reunification , will be awarded the quadriga prize , an award that recognizes people who have set outstanding examples in the political , social or economic fields .
former soviet president mikhail gorbachev will give a speech in kohl 's honor . " little berlin " several leaders of the union bloc of parties , the christian democratic union and the bavarian christian social union , will be on hand at a ceremony in the village of mödlareuth , which was once divided since it straddles the border between bavaria and thuringia , once states of west and east germany respectively .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

but after 40 years of separation , how could the differences have been leveled out any more quickly ? former chancellor helmut kohl promised " flourishing landscapes " 15 years ago , when german unification was implemented .
but such high-flying expectations evaporated long ago ; the outcome is sobering .
it can be seen in the emigration statistics that show that , every year , more people leave germany 's east for the country 's west than vice versa .
since german unification , on oct .
3 , 1990 , nearly 1 million people have turned their backs on eastern germany . that ca n't be merely glossed over .
it brings to light a problem linked to unification that 's been suppressed : above all , eastern germany is losing young people because they see few prospects on the job market .
the cities and towns are becoming ever emptier ; the education level is falling ; tax income in eastern german states and municipalities is dropping and qualified personnel is lacking all over .
nowhere in germany are fewer babies born than in the " new " eastern states .
demographers have raised the alarm .
sacrifices on both sides instead of a " flourishing landscape , " eastern germany is still an immense construction site on which work is being done in a more or less hapless fashion .
the current situation certainly was n't caused by a deficit in solidarity .
every year around 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- are transferred from western to eastern germany , generous developmental aid that 's intended to continue until 2020 .
numerous economic experts see the transfers as a main cause for germany 's weak economy and high unemployment .
and these problems will continue to exist as long as eastern germany does n't stand on its own two feet economically . there 's no doubt that money for developing the east is needed .
the crucial issue , however , is how effectively the money is being used .
economists have long been demanding that politicians correct their approach and increasingly put the money in investments instead of financing unproductive consumption .
instead of continuing on the same route , we need a more open and unsparing analysis of what development is realistically possible .
concretely , how far should germany pursue the original aim of bringing living conditions in east and west into alignment ?
many politicians have avoided such a discussion so far - it could cost votes .

but after 40 years of separation , how could the differences have been leveled out any more quickly ? former chancellor helmut kohl promised " flourishing landscapes " 15 years ago , when german unification was implemented .
but such high-flying expectations evaporated long ago ; the outcome is sobering .
it can be seen in the emigration statistics that show that , every year , more people leave germany 's east for the country 's west than vice versa .
since german unification , on oct .
3 , 1990 , nearly 1 million people have turned their backs on eastern germany . that ca n't be merely glossed over .
it brings to light a problem linked to unification that 's been suppressed : above all , eastern germany is losing young people because they see few prospects on the job market .
the cities and towns are becoming ever emptier ; the education level is falling ; tax income in eastern german states and municipalities is dropping and qualified personnel is lacking all over .
nowhere in germany are fewer babies born than in the " new " eastern states .
demographers have raised the alarm .
sacrifices on both sides instead of a " flourishing landscape , " eastern germany is still an immense construction site on which work is being done in a more or less hapless fashion .
the current situation certainly was n't caused by a deficit in solidarity .
every year around 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- are transferred from western to eastern germany , generous developmental aid that 's intended to continue until 2020 .
numerous economic experts see the transfers as a main cause for germany 's weak economy and high unemployment .
and these problems will continue to exist as long as eastern germany does n't stand on its own two feet economically . there 's no doubt that money for developing the east is needed .
the crucial issue , however , is how effectively the money is being used .
economists have long been demanding that politicians correct their approach and increasingly put the money in investments instead of financing unproductive consumption .
instead of continuing on the same route , we need a more open and unsparing analysis of what development is realistically possible .
concretely , how far should germany pursue the original aim of bringing living conditions in east and west into alignment ?
many politicians have avoided such a discussion so far - it could cost votes .
bildunterschrift : bmw in leipzig still divided of course , the outcome of the past 15 years has by no means been purely negative .
a lot has happened in germany 's east .
the infrastructure has been completely modernized ; city centers have to a large extent been restored ; in places such as leipzig , competitive industrial centers have been established .
for eastern germans modern cars , color tvs , refrigerators and vacations have become as much a matter of course as they have long been for western germans .
above all , the freedom they gained when the berlin wall fell is worth any sacrifice . but 15 years are hardly enough to seamlessly meld together a nation divided for 40 years .

andreas lämmel led with 37 percent , while marlies volkmer of the spd received 32.1 percent . after the inconclusive general election on sept .
18 , the new results mean that the cdu will hold 226 seats in the bundestag versus 222 for the spd . cdu candidate lämmel said the voters had sent a clear signal to berlin , and specifically the german chancellor . " what this means for gerhard schröder is that it 's time for him to pack his bags and move back to hanover , " he said . " we will definitely begin a new round of exploratory talks with the spd on wednesday , " agreed cdu general secretary volker kauder .
" i think progress will be made . "

" spd stands firm germany held its general election two weeks ago but the vote was postponed in dresden 's first district due to the death of a candidate from the neo-nazi npd party . cdu leader angela merkel , aiming to become the germany 's first female chancellor , is expected to exploit the gains in the bitter power struggle that ensued after both she and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder claimed to have a mandate to lead the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german social democratic party candidate marlies volkmer , left , watches with a canvasser the announcement of the first election results in the city hall in dresden , eastern germany , on sunday , oct .

andreas lämmel led with 37 percent , while marlies volkmer of the spd received 32.1 percent . after the inconclusive general election on sept .
18 , the new results mean that the cdu will hold 226 seats in the bundestag versus 222 for the spd . cdu candidate lämmel said the voters had sent a clear signal to berlin , and specifically the german chancellor . " what this means for gerhard schröder is that it 's time for him to pack his bags and move back to hanover , " he said . " we will definitely begin a new round of exploratory talks with the spd on wednesday , " agreed cdu general secretary volker kauder .
" i think progress will be made . "
he also stressed that were schröder to back down , the talks would be far likely to reach a speedier conclusion .
" we expect the spd to see sense , " he said .
" the results in dresden obviously strengthen angela merkel 's position and send a clear signal to the spd . " spd stands firm germany held its general election two weeks ago but the vote was postponed in dresden 's first district due to the death of a candidate from the neo-nazi npd party . cdu leader angela merkel , aiming to become the germany 's first female chancellor , is expected to exploit the gains in the bitter power struggle that ensued after both she and incumbent chancellor gerhard schröder claimed to have a mandate to lead the country . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german social democratic party candidate marlies volkmer , left , watches with a canvasser the announcement of the first election results in the city hall in dresden , eastern germany , on sunday , oct .
2 , 2005 .
despite the inevitable disappointment , the social democrats were n't despairing after sunday 's poll .
while their candidate was n't directly elected , they won most of the second ballots that german voters place for a party , rather than the local contender . " if the spd is the strongest party in dresden , then that strengthens the party nationally as well - in the initial coalition talks and the later negotiations , " stressed marlies volkmer . spd leader franz müntefering agreed .
" we remain the strongest party , " he said , " while the cdu / csu remain the strongest parliamentary group . " impasse to end ? the country has been at a political impasse since the september poll , with both schröder and merkel claiming a mandate due to the knife-edge result .
while the outcome of the dresden vote does n't significantly alter that result , germans expect it will give the conservatives a psychological edge heading into the next round of coalition talks . bildunterschrift : angela merkel now has the psychological edge over gerhard schröder in the race for the chancellorship some 219,000 registered voters in dresden were called to the polls to decide the final make-up of the bundestag , with three seats at stake .
more than 72 percent of eligible voters had cast ballots , election officials said after the polls closed at 6:00 p.m. high voter turnout the high turnout reflected how seriously dresden residents took the election .
on friday , around 5,000 people showed up at a final campaign rally held by the spd , while almost 1,000 attended a simultaneous event held by the cdu .
but while it looked then as though schröder had the lead , sunday 's result told a different story . roland koch , the conservative premier of the state of hesse , said the vote confirmed the cdu and their bavarian sister party , the csu , as the strongest bloc in parliament , and said that it should choose the next chancellor . spd chairman franz müntefering stuck to the course of the past two weeks , saying the dresden result would not have any effect on the coalition talks with the cdu and csu .

dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .
today when people talk about how federalism reform is necessary , it 's actually the call to finally undo what the grand coalition of 1966-1969 did wrong .
that does not inspire confidence . nancy isenson interviewed hans-dietrich genscher send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's slow economic reunification the german government has , over the past years , been harshly criticized for its investment in rebuilding the former east germany , but berlin is sticking to its program of support .

rice allegedly spoke by telephone with turkish prime minister tayyip erdogan , telling him that the eu 's proposed negotiating framework for the talks would not impinge on nato .
the call came after turkey cemented the existing deadlock by objecting to a clause stipulating that it could not block eu members joining international organizations and treaties , which turkish hardliners argue could prevent ankara blocking a divided cyprus from joining nato . the initial start to the eu-turkey talks has already been postponed by british foreign secretary jack straw , on behalf of eu president britain , who said early monday that he was not certain a deal could be struck . " i hope that we are able to make progress but i can not say for certain that we will be able to make progress , " he told reporters . austrian intransigence austria is the country digging its heels in most firmly , refusing to agree to a mandate for the negotiations unless an alternative to full eu membership for the muslim country is offered .
" we do want the negotiations to begin , " stressed austrian foreign minister ursula plassnik .
" but to vote in favor , we require improvements to the text .
that 's what we 're working on . " " we are near to a deal , " said straw , " but we are also on the edge of a precipice . " the failure to start the turkey talks will inevitably deepen an eu crisis triggered by french and dutch voters ' rejection of the bloc 's draft constitution in may and june .
some cited opposition to turkey 's eu hopes as a reason for voting no . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " turkey has brought two europes face to face , " commented turkish newspaper vatan monday .
" a europe that looks to a future of absolute peace by ending religious diaparity and conflict , and a europe that seeks to preserve its religious identity with xenophobia and racist , nationalistic fundamentalism . " " very little progress " austria 's plassnik , arriving for a bilateral meeting with straw ahead of the resumed eu talks , said there could still be a deal , even though admitting that " very little progress " had been made so far . " we have n't yet given up hope , " she told reporters .
" we need to move towards each other , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jack straw plassnik refused to bow under the pressure of being confronted by all her fellow european union members . " we are not afraid of difficult situations , " she told reporters after another round of talks with straw .
" there are limits , and we are about to explore them now . " turkey threatens to turn its back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül in ankara , turkish foreign minister abdullah gül huddled with his advisors awaiting news that never came that austria had ceded ground .
despite its eu ambitions , turkey has threatened to turn its back if vienna gets its way . after four decades of knocking at europe 's door , the vast , predominantly muslim country was given a date of oct .
3 to start talks by eu leaders in december . but ankara 's recent insistence that it would still not recognise eu member state cyprus , in a declaration attached to a customs agreement in july , created new strains just weeks before its long-awaited date . the present dispute focuses on the wording of the " negotiating framework " for the accession talks - essentially their guiding procedures and principles - which austria wants to refer to something other than full membership . eu - a christian club ? but it is difficult to see exactly what change of wording is needed . the current draft - accepted by all 24 other eu states - says that eu entry is the main aim of the talks .
vienna would like that tempered with another formula , if not replaced altogether . the new eu delay has angered turkish politicians and the public alike . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan , whose country has suffered through tough political , economic and social reform to join , warned the eu against being a " christian club " by refusing to start the talks . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player ... or it will limit itself to a christian club , " he said . the croatian factor one unknown factor is exactly how much stock austria puts in neighboring croatia being given the green light on monday to start its own delayed talks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : croation war crimes suspect ante gotovina croatia was originally to have started eu entry talks in march , but its case has been held up by its lack of cooperation with the un war crimes tribunal , notably over a key war crimes suspect , fugitive general ante gotovina -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in an interview with dw-world , hans-dietrich genscher , who as german foreign minister was instrumental in croatia being internationally recognized as an independent state , argued in favor of the country joining the bloc .
" the admission of slovenia shows that it was advantageous for the slovenes but also for the current eu member states .
and the same thing holds true for croatia .
croatia has covered a remarkable path to democracy .
croatia fulfills the prerequisites for eu membership . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey challenges eu to be " world player " turkey 's prime minister challenged the european union on sunday to be a " world player " rather than a " christian club , " as the bloc deliberated whether to open formal membership talks with the largely muslim country .

2 , 2005 -rrb- german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .

that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .

she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .

many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

" many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

but after 40 years of separation , how could the differences have been leveled out any more quickly ? former chancellor helmut kohl promised " flourishing landscapes " 15 years ago , when german unification was implemented .
but such high-flying expectations evaporated long ago ; the outcome is sobering .
it can be seen in the emigration statistics that show that , every year , more people leave germany 's east for the country 's west than vice versa .
since german unification , on oct .
3 , 1990 , nearly 1 million people have turned their backs on eastern germany . that ca n't be merely glossed over .
it brings to light a problem linked to unification that 's been suppressed : above all , eastern germany is losing young people because they see few prospects on the job market .
the cities and towns are becoming ever emptier ; the education level is falling ; tax income in eastern german states and municipalities is dropping and qualified personnel is lacking all over .
nowhere in germany are fewer babies born than in the " new " eastern states .
demographers have raised the alarm .
sacrifices on both sides instead of a " flourishing landscape , " eastern germany is still an immense construction site on which work is being done in a more or less hapless fashion .
the current situation certainly was n't caused by a deficit in solidarity .
every year around 90 billion euros -lrb- $ 108 billion -rrb- are transferred from western to eastern germany , generous developmental aid that 's intended to continue until 2020 .
numerous economic experts see the transfers as a main cause for germany 's weak economy and high unemployment .
and these problems will continue to exist as long as eastern germany does n't stand on its own two feet economically . there 's no doubt that money for developing the east is needed .
the crucial issue , however , is how effectively the money is being used .
economists have long been demanding that politicians correct their approach and increasingly put the money in investments instead of financing unproductive consumption .
instead of continuing on the same route , we need a more open and unsparing analysis of what development is realistically possible .
concretely , how far should germany pursue the original aim of bringing living conditions in east and west into alignment ?
many politicians have avoided such a discussion so far - it could cost votes .
bildunterschrift : bmw in leipzig still divided of course , the outcome of the past 15 years has by no means been purely negative .
a lot has happened in germany 's east .
the infrastructure has been completely modernized ; city centers have to a large extent been restored ; in places such as leipzig , competitive industrial centers have been established .
for eastern germans modern cars , color tvs , refrigerators and vacations have become as much a matter of course as they have long been for western germans .
above all , the freedom they gained when the berlin wall fell is worth any sacrifice . but 15 years are hardly enough to seamlessly meld together a nation divided for 40 years .
that which divided them pales , but much more slowly than many people are willing to admit .
more than half of western germans see the eastern germans as unification 's profiteers and consider them unappreciative of the many sacrifices the westerners made .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators in jena , eastern germany , against welfare reform .
the sign reads , " we are the poeple , " which was east germans ' rallying cry when the berlin wall fell .
on the other hand , more than a third of the people in the east think that those in the west have the upper hand when it comes to unification .
many of them feel patronized , that the west german model was simply imposed on them and even east germany 's positive aspects - the compatibility of family and work , for example - were abolished .
but germans do n't really like to talk about these sentiments in public because they fear it will fan the flames of envy between east and west , and that they will be labelled opponents of unification . but a bit more sangfroid would do the discussion good .
firstly , despite all the talk about unified germany 's situation , the overwhelming majority of germans , from east and west , view reunification positively .
secondly , it 's an illusion to think that 40 years of differing developments take place without leaving a trace on a country and its people .
why is it so difficult to accept that differences - in the way people think and feel as well as in people 's living conditions - exist ?
perhaps it 's because germany has n't yet prepared itself for such a possibility .
it 's about time we got used to the idea . verica spasovska -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

3 , 1990 unification of west and east germany .
dw-world spoke to the foreign minister at the time , hans-dietrich genscher . hans-dietrich genscher served as foreign minister of the federal republic of germany from 1974 to 1992 .
born in 1927 , he grew up in the eastern german town of halle .
after the war , he studied law and left east germany for the west in 1952 , where he joined the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
he was a member of the bundestag from 1965-1998 .
as foreign minister in the christian union-fdp coalition government led by chancellor helmut kohl , genscher was instrumental in german unification . dw-world : putting down germany almost seems like a national sport .
tell me something positive about germany today .
where can we see rays of hope ? hans-dietrich genscher : first of all , in unification itself and in the fact that germany today is an important and active member in the european union .
that applies to the germans in the north and south , in east and in west .
that 's why i do n't see any occasion for such negative appraisals .
germany faces big problems .
we must carry out reforms .
that has less to do with unification than with , on the one hand , the consequences of socialist mismanagement before unification , and on the other hand , that the age structure in our society is changing , that we have to hold our own in the face of globalization 's challenges . i think people differentiate ever less often between eastern and western germany .
the young generation sees our country 's future in europe as a shared challenge .
for decades , we germans had to live apart against our will in two very different political systems .
that 's no longer the case .
the future is a common future .
to hold our own in the face of this challenge is also a shared challenge and a shared purpose .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate in berlin on nov .
10 , 1989 , a day after the wall " fell " the wall in people 's heads is still there .
why do western germans still have so many prejudices against eastern germans and vice versa ? i do n't have that impression at all .
my experience of many eastern germans making their way in the west is that they feel like germans .
i have the feeling that people might talk about " the wall in the heads " with relish , but it 's not a reality . around this time last year , you pointed out that uniformity of living conditions in eastern and western germany was a " valid constitutional right . "
fifteen years ago , how long did you expect it would take for living conditions to reach a similar level ?
i said it would be a long , rocky road and that there could also be -lrb- periods of -rrb- stagnancy and setback , but we would manage it .
nothing has changed in that assessment .
after all , one ca n't magically sweep away the problems that were made over more than 40 years of socialist economy in the east over night .
anyone who said anything different either had no clue about the situation in the east or said something frivolously .
but if you look at places in the east today with the most modern infrastructure in germany , modern industry - many small and medium-sized companies are being started . if you look back on the past 15 years , do you think it was right to unify east and west germany so quickly ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genscher -lrb- from l . -rrb- with hannelore and helmut kohl and german president richard von weizsäcker on oct .
3 , 1990 in berlin there was no other way .
it was a window of opportunity in history that opened and we used it to peacefully implement german unification .
it was absolutely right .
in those days i had a different opinion regarding incentive measures .
i thought that while the division -lrb- of germany -rrb- was still in effect we should have fostered production in the east so that the added value would have provided an incentive to establish production facilities there .
that did n't receive any backing from our coalition partner cdu / csu or even from the social democrats .
but there are repeated calls to try that route after all .
in those days , the effect would have been without a doubt greater . recently a nationwide campaign was launched - du bist deutschland -lrb- you are germany -rrb- - to motivate the depressed germans .
what does the country need to shake off the bad mood ? above all , a government that inspires confidence , speaks openly about problems , but does n't just complain about the problems , and instead identifies the possible solutions and takes that route reliably . is n't complaining a german characteristic ? that 's part of it , too . -lrb- laughs -rrb- two years ago , you said : " grand coalition means grand stalemate . "
now it seems likely we 'll soon see a grand coalition of the christian union parties and the social democrats in government .
what 's your view of the immediate future ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans- dietrich genscher my opinion is unchanged : a grand coalition always means a two-way blockade culminating in wrong decisions .

dw-tv sent two reporters to take a look at how the other half lives 15 years later , just beyond the halfway mark . zittau in the former east germany and dortmund in the west are a good place to start - two cities on either sides of the country that are both former industrial centers and now suffering from high unemployment . dortmund , once home to coal mines and steel plants , was a city looking to renew itself in the late 1980s .
but then came german unification , and money for big public spending projects headed eastwards . many locals are still angry about the investment in the east , and say they need it just as badly .
the city 's former mayor does n't agree . he has little time for those who complain about the cost of unification . " it 's nonsense , it 's just old hat , " he said .
" i 'm convinced that most people see it that way as well .
of course you 'll always get the odd person saying they 'd have more money if it was n't for unification .
and i just say - exactly how much more would you have ?
ten euros 50 ? "
lingering resentment but others insist the easterners still have n't realized that there 's no such thing as a free lunch . " they do n't show any initiative , " complained one man .
" they just expect more money .
but you have to do something for yourself . " people in dortmund obviously feel they have little in common with their eastern neighbors .
" a wall still exists , " pointed out a local woman .
" an invisible one .
the country is still divided . " and to many , the differences are still glaring .
" you can tell if someone 's from the east - even if you do n't hear it straight away , " said one passer-by .
" you can tell just from the way they are . " behind the scenes in zittau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zittau meanwhile in zittau - on the south-eastern tip of what was once east germany , right next to poland and the czech republic - unification has brought the city a much-needed face-lift .
the air is cleaner now too .
but behind the spic and span facade , this is still a depressed region .
one in four people are on welfare , while one third of the city 's population has upped and left .
the factories are gone , and so are the jobs . " i 'm out of work , " said one local .
" my wife is too .
we live on welfare .
that 's what german unification has done for us . " local officials are well aware of the problems people here are facing . " it 's very difficult for eastern germans to get used to living off the state for a long time , " explained zittau mayor arnd voigt .
" that 's certainly one of the reasons why people here say german unification has n't achieved what they expected it to . " across germany , women bear the brunt it 's especially hard for women to find a job .
many have given up any career ambitions , and just stay at home .
the development dismays kersten kühne , a lecturer at the local college .
she 's started offering courses aimed at getting more women to study for science qualifications . " in the former east germany , it was completely normal for boys and girls to both do science at school , and to see it is a possible career , " she said .
" it was nothing unusual .
it was n't something that was just typical for men .
and i think that 's a huge failing now in our society , that that is n't the case any more . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women in dortmund face a different problem .
many mothers here want to get back to work as quickly as possible but are unable to find suitable daycare facilities for small children .
here the west of the country is lagging behind the east . " i was really lucky to find a place in a nursery , " said one mother in dortmund .
" it 's not something you can take for granted in germany .
you normally only get one if you 're a single mother who 's out at work .
anyone else has to be really lucky to get a place . " hopes dashed shortly after the wall came down , civil rights activist horst schiermeyer moved to zittau from the west , keen to be part of a new dawn .
but the euphoria quickly evaporated .
the people of east germany had taken to the streets in a people 's revolution - but were soon disappointed by how little " people power " unification actually brought them . " many of them recognized quite quickly that scope for actually realizing they 'd stood up for - democracy , co-determination , shaping their own futures - was much more limited in a unified germany than they expected , " he explained . unification was n't just a rude awakening to the easterners .
west germans also had to come to terms with new and harsh realities .
the steel plant in dortmund , for example , could n't turn a profit and was soon shut down . attracting investment konrad hachmeyer is in redevelopment , and his vision is to create a lake on the site for the former steel furnaces , with homes and offices and hi-tech businesses around its shores . " water in a city is always a big attraction for people and for visitors .
and it can also attract companies and offices and investors .
around the area where the lake will be , we 're going to build office space and residential space , and then in 2008 , we 'll flood the lake , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer this lake in zittau , on the site of a former coal mine , is the result of a similar project .
it 's just one of a series of projects brought about with the help of holger knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
he 's battled to find funding for initiatives that have attracted new investment to the city and created 1,500 new jobs . in zittau , as in dortmund , hopes for the future are built on the promise of new industries and new technology .
but even holger knüpfer knows that there are limits to what can be achieved . " it wo n't ever be possible to get companies here that require a huge amount of manpower , " he said .
" and that is n't the aim of our economic development projects .
the fact is that for companies that need a lot of manpower , the conditions in terms of labor law and labor costs are much better across the border in poland or the czech republic .

for over 45 years , west and east germany existed side-by-side but in two different worlds .
in a matter of months , the improbable became reality . it was the stuff movies are made of and it was a hollywood actor who would start a steamroller that did n't stop until german reunification .
former movie star and american president ronald reagan was determined to weaken the soviet union to the point that the world 's second superpower would cease to exist - and he was unloved by many germans for some of his policies to achieve that goal , particularly the stationing of pershing missiles in europe .
reagan 's soviet counterpart , mikhail gorbachev , had become head of the ussr in 1985 , and instituted reforms to try and save communism there .
perestroika and glasnost were part of the zeitgeist , words that meant more freedoms for russians and eastern europeans alike . reagan knew how to take advantage of this .
his theatrical demand to tear down the berlin wall while visiting the enclave in 1987 was only wishful thinking at the time , but in the next two years history took a turn that only the bravest and most sanguine opponents of communism would have ventured to predict .
east german leaders underestimate the situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the last military parade for east germany took place on october 7 , 1989 , 40 years to the day of the country 's founding die ehrentribüne auf der karl-marx-allee während der militärparade am 7 .
oktober 1989 in ost-berlin mit dem sowjetischen staats- und parteichef michail gorbatschow -lrb- 2.v.l -rrb- dem ddr-staatsratsvorsitzenden und sed-generalsekretär erich honecker -lrb- 3.v.l. -rrb- , raissa gorbatschowa -lrb- hinter honecker -rrb- , die gattin des sowjetischen präsidenten und willi stoph -lrb- 2.v.r. -rrb- , ministerpräsident der ddr .
mit einer militärparde feierte die führung der ddr die gründung der deutschen demokratischen republik vor 40 jahren .
as the wheels of an unstoppable train began rolling , the leaders in east berlin failed to follow the lead of gorbachev and some of its warsaw pact neighbors by loosening their iron grip on the country .
in january 1989 , sed party chief erich honecker still intoned that the wall would be standing for another 50 , or even 100 years .
yet , the people of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- were becoming restless , with demonstrations on the streets of dresden and leipzig , and masses fleeing the country through czechoslovakia and hungary .
the east german leadership , finally reading the writing on the wall , tried to stop the bleeding by allowing greater freedom to travel .
on nov .
9 , without a shot being fired , without any blood being spilled , the wall crumbled .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : günter schabowski unwittingly read the announcement that would send tens of thousands of east germans through checkpoints at the wall der journalist und frühere politiker , mitglied des politbüro des zk der sed 1984-1989 , gibt am 9 .
november 1989 während einer pressekonferenz in ost-berlin -lrb- ddr -rrb- die öffnung der innerdeutschen grenze bekannt .
günter schabowski wurde am 4 .
januar 1929 in anklam -lrb- mecklenburg -rrb- geboren .
" we 've decided today to implement a ruling that allows every east german citizen to exit at border controls in order to travel outside the country , " was the misinterpreted announcement by politburo member günter schabowski -lrb- photo -rrb- .
in a matter of minutes , the checkpoint stations along the wall that divided east from west were flooded by east germans .
they were dramatic , tearful scenes that remain branded in the memory of any german old enough to remember .
reunification process steamrolls ahead the sudden breakdown of sovereignty did not please everyone at the top levels of the east german leadership .
die-hard communists called for the execution of the sed party heads , who in their eyes was responsible for the collapse of the gdr .
others wanted to retain an independent , democratized east german state .
but these dreams were swept away by " the people , " who continued to march on the streets , chanting " we are one people ! " making reference to their desire that the two germanys belong together as one .
west german chancellor helmut kohl recognized that he could take advantage of this window of opportunity , even if he knew it was a window that could close very suddenly and possibly very violently .
bildunterschrift : west german chancellor helmut kohl and soviet leader mikhail gorbachev in july 1990 " we germans have learned from history , " he assured the rest of europe and the world .
" we are a peace-loving and freedom-loving people .
and we will never let our democracy succumb to the enemies of peace and freedom .
the love of our fatherland , freedom and being a good neighbor are a part of us . "
talks lead to rapid reunification as unstoppable as the people of east germany were when throwing off the communist cloak to reunify with west germany , so was the acceptance of the event in european capitals .
the victors of world war ii , and some particularly fervent opponents of german reunification such as british prime minister margaret thatcher , went to the negotiating table .
at an inconceivable pace considering just what was at stake , namely the reconfiguration of european geopolitics , a treaty was drawn up .
britain , france , the soviet union and the usa would withdraw from a reunified germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president francois mitterrand -lrb- l -rrb- german chancellor helmut kohl brought about reconciliation between the two countries germany received total independence for the first time since 1945 .
in return , it officially recognized the existing border with poland .
the process hit some bumps along the way , for example with the introduction of the german mark to the east in the summer of 1990 .
in august 1990 , though , the east german parliament took the historic vote that would close the book on the german democratic republic .
then federal president richard von weizsäcker , speaking on october 3 , 1990 , said what would turn out to be prophetic words for the reunified germany : " no treaty between governments , no constitution , no legislation , will determine how successful this unity will be at a human level .
that depends solely on the actions of each and every one of us .

the bank of japan 's key tankan survey of sentiment among big manufacturers showed a positive balance of 19 for the three months to the end of september .
this compared with + 18 for the previous quarter and with the + 20 balance which had been expected by the markets .
japanese shares and the yen both fell after the publication of the report .
by mid-afternoon trading , the nikkei 225 index of leading stocks was down 22 points to 13,552 , while the yen had dropped to a 16-month low against the us dollar .
growing economy the bank of japan 's tankan survey comes to its figure by subtracting the percentage of firms reporting unfavourable conditions from those reporting favourable ones .
" it -lsb- the latest business confidence survey -rsb- was slightly softer than expected , likely due to a rise in input costs and higher energy prices , " said masaaki nanno , managing director of research at jp morgan .
high global oil prices are being driven by strong demand , particularly from china .
the recent hurricanes in the us have also kept prices high after they damaged a number of refineries in the gulf of mexico .
a separate report from the ministry of finance showed last week that japan 's economy grew in august , boosted by a rise in household spending and a decline in unemployment .
industrial output also rebounded during the month , rising 1.2 % in august from july , the government said .

until now , patients have had to travel to london to use similar scanners .
but welsh assembly government funding has paid for two of the sophisticated machines which can detect tiny tumours .
they will be based at the university of wales hospital , cardiff .
one of the scanners will treat patients and the other will be used for research .
the positron emission tomography -lrb- pet -rrb- scanners are so powerful , they can monitor the functioning of tiny tumours only 2mm in size .
andrew davies , welsh economic development and transport minister , and brian gibbons , welsh health minister , announced that the new scanners had been acquired on monday .
positron emission tomography is a powerful imaging technique used to identify a range of diseases such as cancers , heart disease , and brain disorders .
the scanners - which are believed to cost around £ 6m for the pair - will be based at a purpose-built unit at wales ' largest teaching hospital and will produce detailed and accurate images for both clinical staff and researchers .
' research opportunities ' mr davies said the investment would also help in creating more jobs in bio-medical research .
he added : " this substantial investment is a major step forward in the development of wales as a centre of excellence for bio-medical research .
" such a state-of-the-art facility supports the extensive work already carried out across wales , including the brain imaging and repair centre at cardiff university , the work at the wales gene park , the world-leading institute of life science at swansea , and the excellent psychological and medical work at bangor university . "
dr gibbons added : " this investment will provide significant benefits for patients in wales , as well as boosting our capacity for cutting-edge medical research .
" pet scanning provides important additional biological information in addition to traditional images .
" it can be of significant advantage in improving diagnosis and will also help towards ensuring patients receive the most appropriate treatment .
" in some cases , the scanner will show that surgery is not necessary and that a different treatment or procedure would be better . "

andrew davies , welsh economic development and transport minister , and brian gibbons , welsh health minister , announced that the new scanners had been acquired on monday .
positron emission tomography is a powerful imaging technique used to identify a range of diseases such as cancers , heart disease , and brain disorders .
the scanners - which are believed to cost around £ 6m for the pair - will be based at a purpose-built unit at wales ' largest teaching hospital and will produce detailed and accurate images for both clinical staff and researchers .
' research opportunities ' mr davies said the investment would also help in creating more jobs in bio-medical research .
he added : " this substantial investment is a major step forward in the development of wales as a centre of excellence for bio-medical research .
" such a state-of-the-art facility supports the extensive work already carried out across wales , including the brain imaging and repair centre at cardiff university , the work at the wales gene park , the world-leading institute of life science at swansea , and the excellent psychological and medical work at bangor university . "
dr gibbons added : " this investment will provide significant benefits for patients in wales , as well as boosting our capacity for cutting-edge medical research .
" pet scanning provides important additional biological information in addition to traditional images .
" it can be of significant advantage in improving diagnosis and will also help towards ensuring patients receive the most appropriate treatment .
" in some cases , the scanner will show that surgery is not necessary and that a different treatment or procedure would be better . "

ben brantley is america 's leading theatre critic - a man who can make or break a broadway show by the flick of his pen .
as a former feature writer , fashion pundit and film critic , mr brantley has had a broad experience of the media .
but he believes it was his well-spent youth as a " theatre geek " and am-dram enthusiast that ultimately won mr brantley his post at the new york times - and top billing among critics .
the 50-year-old critic is a reviewer who does not mince his words , but he is modest about his influence in new york 's theatreland .
" on broadway , i think reviews are less and less relevant .
so much of the broadway audience now is tourists , who want to approximate the experience of going to a theme park . "
" mamma mia was totally critic-proof , " says mr brantley , of the hit tribute musical .
" people come to new york to see a ' jukebox musical ' .
it would n't make a difference what a critic said .
mamma mia would still find a huge audience and run forever . "
spamalot is among the new york shows brantley calls " critic-proof " " spamalot got very mixed reviews here , " he adds .
" but it still had a guaranteed audience .
so much of what happens here is a repackaging of familiar material . "
it 's a theme to which mr brantley returns in his reviews , where he finds theatrical gems are increasingly found away from broadway .
" for real creative vitality , you have to look in some of the darker side streets of manhattan these days , " says mr brantley - who cites spirit , from the british ensemble improbable theatre , as one of his favourite shows of the moment .
" often the most satisfying theatre is the sparsest .
you get the inventiveness . "
" for those smaller , more independent ventures , if you are very encouraging about a production - you can certainly help it get grants , if not audiences , " explains mr brantley .

" at the moment we are in the midst of ' the theatre of celebrity ' .
if you can get a star , preferably from tv or the movies , and especially if they are willing to take their clothes off - you are guaranteed a hit .
" people love a pan , and they love to see the mighty fall from their pedestals - but i try to go to the theatre with an open mind , despite temptation . "
" sometimes you will be pleasantly surprised .
kathleen turner , who did nothing but take her clothes off in the graduate , was brilliant in the recent revival of who 's afraid of viriginia woolf ? "
stars willing to take their clothes off " guarantee a hit " the writer believes strong acting is crucial to creating a great piece of theatre , but adds that " performers are almost always alerted to when a critic is in the audience , so they tend to be on their best behaviour " .
" there are so many factors to making a good show .
you want to be surprised , " says mr brantley , who highlights originality and consistency as key pointers to a good production .
" you want something that works as a theatrical experience , as opposed to imitating a karaoke bar or a hit movie . "
" when a play takes me to a place that only theatre can , that 's when i 'm most satisfied . "
" the most difficult thing of course is ' the shrug ' - when something is just ok . "
working as a journalist in paris as a young man , mr brantley spent many weekends taking in the shows in london 's west end .
" when i went to london i would be like the proverbial ' kid in the candy shop ' , i 'd be so excited . "
the history boys was part of the national 's hit season in 2004 " unfortunately there are fewer differences between london and new york than there used to be , " adds mr brantley , citing the creeping commercialisation of theatre in both cities .
" but i think the national theatre has been really revitalised under nicholas hytner , the previous season was dynamite . "
nor is mr brantley particularly excited by the new season on broadway , but he is looking forward to seeing gabriel byrne in eugene o 'neill 's a touch of the poet .
the rest of us will just have to wait for his review .

willie walsh , who takes over as ba chief executive on monday , said the wildcat strike by baggage handlers and check-in staff could not be justified .
hundreds of staff walked out in sympathy with sacked workers at the airline catering firm gate gourmet .
some of ba 's working practices were " completely irrelevant " , mr walsh said .
customer recovery the former aer lingus boss has been acting as ba 's chief executive designate since april and will formally succeed rod eddington on monday .
mr walsh takes over at a difficult time for ba . "
it is fair to say that there are working practices that are completely irrelevant to the business today " willie walsh new ba boss hoping for less turbulence it is one of the world 's most profitable airlines but is contending with soaring energy bills and a recent history of fraught industrial relations .
an unofficial strike by ba workers in august severely disrupted services for almost 48 hours and is estimated to have cost the airline up to £ 40m .
mr walsh said the strike action - triggered by an industrial relations dispute at gate gourmet - had been highly damaging .
" it was damaging to our reputation , to our brand and to morale and we are going to have to work hard to recover customers who were impacted , " mr walsh told the sunday times magazine .
' no justification ' mr walsh said the strike was unwelcome to the " vast majority " of staff .
" you have to be clear that this was nothing to do with british airways and i do n't believe that anybody can seek to justify it in retrospect or suggest that we should have seen it coming . "
ba is looking to make savings of £ 300m by 2007 ahead of its move to the new terminal 5 at heathrow a year later .
unions are worried that mr walsh - who transformed aer lingus ' fortunes after cutting thousands of jobs - could oversee a substantial reduction in the workforce .
" i think that you could say that people are apprehensive and concerned , " pete sweet , chairman of the ba trades union council , told the sunday times magazine .
mr walsh said he would do what was right for ba .
but he warned that some of the airline 's existing working practices were incompatible with improving customer satisfaction and safety .
" it is fair to say that there are working practices that are completely irrelevant to the business today .
" that is why terminal 5 represents an opportunity for us to start all over again . "

" it was damaging to our reputation , to our brand and to morale and we are going to have to work hard to recover customers who were impacted , " mr walsh told the sunday times magazine .
' no justification ' mr walsh said the strike was unwelcome to the " vast majority " of staff .
" you have to be clear that this was nothing to do with british airways and i do n't believe that anybody can seek to justify it in retrospect or suggest that we should have seen it coming . "
ba has been hit by strikes in the past two summers ba is looking to make savings of £ 300m by 2007 ahead of its move to the new terminal 5 at heathrow a year later .
unions are worried that mr walsh - who transformed aer lingus ' fortunes after cutting thousands of jobs - could oversee a substantial reduction in the workforce .
" i think that you could say that people are apprehensive and concerned , " pete sweet , chairman of the ba trades union council , told the sunday times magazine .
mr walsh said he would do what was right for ba .
but he warned that some of the airline 's existing working practices were incompatible with improving customer satisfaction and safety .
" it is fair to say that there are working practices that are completely irrelevant to the business today .
" that is why terminal 5 represents an opportunity for us to start all over again . "

if you ask someone in the street what it means , most stare blankly , thinking it is something to do with peas or you have to have an ipod to do it .
a poll revealed this week that nine out of 10 of uk 's taxi drivers , hairdressers and pub landlords - the apparent " barometers " of uk society - had no clue what " podcasting " was .
that is no real surprise ; many people would struggle to define a " weft " .
and the " web " was something a spider built not so long ago .
but it seems a shame that the very people who are renowned for being some of the best talkers and commentators in britain mostly have no clue what podcasting is . "
real comedians , especially people breaking through , could use it as a vehicle " chris skinner , simulacrum even the likes of chris moyles on bbc radio 1 talks about it , but for many it is not relevant unless you know what it lets you do .
if you say it is a way of getting thousands of hours of audio content delivered automatically to your music player or computer , it looks a little more interesting .
if it means anyone can record that side-splitting post-pub banter or witty critique of pop idol , and have potentially millions listen in on it , then it takes on a different meaning .
podcasting lets people do more or less whatever they want to .
they can take the kinds of risks with show formats and ideas because podcasters only answer to themselves .
the podcaster is the editor and the media .
although tv poker has become quite compulsive viewing for some , imagining it getting commissioned as a radio show is a stretch .
yet , the uk lads from poker diagram regularly podcast their games of online poker .
backroom talent some have described podcasting as " mecasting " .
but what forms the lifeblood of podcasting is content .
licensed music is a no-no for podcasters who wish to veer away from the music industry 's legal might .
the grip that the music industry has on its tunes has , in a sense , made podcasters look to new ideas and alternative content .
perhaps partly because of those restrictions too , podcasters have organised to ensure new bands and unsigned bands can be heard through podcasts , making it a new platform for their music .
the podsafe music network is one such organised place where podcasters can register to make use of music from bands that are a part of the network .
all they have to do is credit them and provide a link where people can buy the album , if there is one .
what podcasting also potentially offers , however , is a launch pad for the richness of talent that exists in smoky manchester comedy clubs and pub backrooms where poets fester , a pad that could mean your ramblings reach ears in trinidad .
chris skinner , is the host of simulacrum , a star-studded podcast in which the rich and famous guests including " haile selassie " , " tom cruise " , " catherine zeta douglas " and " dr robert mugabe " , enjoy a gentle probing .
as a radio producer for an independent radio production company , he has had plenty of experience in trying to get shows and ideas commissioned by mainstream media .
he can not deny he saw podcasting as a chance to showcase his talents .
" the potential for podcasting is massive , " he told the bbc news website at europe 's first podcasting conference , podcastconuk , earlier this month .
" whether it gets realised or not is another thing " .
the people he thinks are being " criminally slow " in catching onto podcasting are stand-up comedians .
he has managed to cajole some onto his show .
" real comedians , especially people breaking through , could use it as a vehicle , " he thinks .
to mr skinner , podcasting gives him the freedom to do shows that mainstream media might shy away from .
" it is the perfect place for people with content , " he says .
taxi -lrb- cast -rrb- please podcasting is a buzzword that has stuck to what is essentially about ordinary people creating audio shows on what they want to listen to .
to many podcasters , it is about reclaiming the radio and using the powerful and easy technology many now have , to do what they want .
the fact that it is downloadable onto any digital music player also means the shows can be " time shifted " - they can be listened to whenever ; they can be paused , rewound , and replayed .
anyone can be the audience - as long as they have a net connection , so it is the kind of technology that brings together content and community in a new kind of kingdom .
there is clearly a lot of work to be done before podcasting becomes mainstream as a way of showcasing home-grown talent .
being able to access podcasts via itunes has certainly helped .
that includes technical solutions that make it as easy as brushing teeth to create and publish a podcast .
companies such as odeo , set up by evan williams who created the easy publishing tool blogger , are well on the way to working these issues out .
but , says mr skinner : " it is much easier than you think .
all you need is a friend who knows .
but there is also enough help on -lsb- internet -rsb- forums - you just type in ' how do i do it . " '
then all we have to do is wait for the taxicasts , the haircasts and the pubcasts to start rolling in .

if you ask someone in the street what it means , most stare blankly , thinking it is something to do with peas or you have to have an ipod to do it .
a poll revealed this week that nine out of 10 of uk 's taxi drivers , hairdressers and pub landlords - the apparent " barometers " of uk society - had no clue what " podcasting " was .
that is no real surprise ; many people would struggle to define a " weft " .
and the " web " was something a spider built not so long ago .
but it seems a shame that the very people who are renowned for being some of the best talkers and commentators in britain mostly have no clue what podcasting is .
real comedians , especially people breaking through , could use it as a vehicle chris skinner , simulacrum even the likes of chris moyles on bbc radio 1 talks about it , but for many it is not relevant unless you know what it lets you do .
if you say it is a way of getting thousands of hours of audio content delivered automatically to your music player or computer , it looks a little more interesting .
if it means anyone can record that side-splitting post-pub banter or witty critique of pop idol , and have potentially millions listen in on it , then it takes on a different meaning .
podcasting lets people do more or less whatever they want to .
they can take the kinds of risks with show formats and ideas because podcasters only answer to themselves .
the podcaster is the editor and the media .
although tv poker has become quite compulsive viewing for some , imagining it getting commissioned as a radio show is a stretch .
yet , the uk lads from poker diagram regularly podcast their games of online poker .
backroom talent some have described podcasting as " mecasting " .
but what forms the lifeblood of podcasting is content .
licensed music is a no-no for podcasters who wish to veer away from the music industry 's legal might .
the grip that the music industry has on its tunes has , in a sense , made podcasters look to new ideas and alternative content .
perhaps partly because of those restrictions too , podcasters have organised to ensure new bands and unsigned bands can be heard through podcasts , making it a new platform for their music .
the podsafe music network is one such organised place where podcasters can register to make use of music from bands that are a part of the network .
all they have to do is credit them and provide a link where people can buy the album , if there is one .
what podcasting also potentially offers , however , is a launch pad for the richness of talent that exists in smoky manchester comedy clubs and pub backrooms where poets fester , a pad that could mean your ramblings reach ears in trinidad .

as a radio producer for an independent radio production company , he has had plenty of experience in trying to get shows and ideas commissioned by mainstream media .
he can not deny he saw podcasting as a chance to showcase his talents .
" the potential for podcasting is massive , " he told the bbc news website at europe 's first podcasting conference , podcastconuk , earlier this month .
" whether it gets realised or not is another thing " .
the people he thinks are being " criminally slow " in catching onto podcasting are stand-up comedians .
he has managed to cajole some onto his show .
" real comedians , especially people breaking through , could use it as a vehicle , " he thinks .
to mr skinner , podcasting gives him the freedom to do shows that mainstream media might shy away from .
" it is the perfect place for people with content , " he says .
taxi -lrb- cast -rrb- please podcasting is a buzzword that has stuck to what is essentially about ordinary people creating audio shows on what they want to listen to .
to many podcasters , it is about reclaiming the radio and using the powerful and easy technology many now have , to do what they want .
the fact that it is downloadable onto any digital music player also means the shows can be " time shifted " - they can be listened to whenever ; they can be paused , rewound , and replayed .
roll on the taxicasts ?
anyone can be the audience - as long as they have a net connection , so it is the kind of technology that brings together content and community in a new kind of kingdom .
there is clearly a lot of work to be done before podcasting becomes mainstream as a way of showcasing home-grown talent .
being able to access podcasts via itunes has certainly helped .
that includes technical solutions that make it as easy as brushing teeth to create and publish a podcast .
companies such as odeo , set up by evan williams who created the easy publishing tool blogger , are well on the way to working these issues out .
but , says mr skinner : " it is much easier than you think .
all you need is a friend who knows .
but there is also enough help on -lsb- internet -rsb- forums - you just type in ' how do i do it . " '
then all we have to do is wait for the taxicasts , the haircasts and the pubcasts to start rolling in .

in the first of five pieces by photographers talking about their award-winning work , david turnley describes how he captured the image of a young us sergeant at the moment he learns that the body bag next to him contains the body of his friend , killed by " friendly fire " .
the widely published photo became an iconic image of the 1991 gulf war - a war in which media access was limited by pentagon restrictions .
i was on assignment with the detroit free press and us news and world report magazine .
i had originally been dispatched as part of a pool to be attached to the 82nd airborne as one of the forward-most combat photographers .
we were accompanied by a public affairs officer whose job was to make sure we stuck to pentagon restrictions .
this meant we would not be allowed to photograph casualties of war and certainly not war dead .
it became clear to me that it was going to be very difficult for me to document the reality of the war while i was out in the field , i got wind that much of the tv coverage was portraying a kind of sanitised war , one in which big technology was being used but that no human life , and particularly not american life , was at risk .
it became clear to me that it was going to be very difficult for me to document the reality of the war .
in the meantime , i had encountered an elite mash unit .
i told the head of the unit that although i had misgivings about the war , it was clear to me that this particular unit was going to serve a very vital role in helping people and i wanted to document that .
' friendly fire ' the only challenge he had was that there was n't a public affairs officer attached to the unit .
i said that was n't a problem with me if it was n't a problem with him .
so i stayed with the doctors and nurses for a few weeks and we developed a trust .
you are depriving these men of their due heroism - the fact that they had to risk their lives to fight in this war on what turned out to be the last day of the war , i joined the helicopter evacuation unit on a mission .
a radio communication came in and it was very clear from the expression on the captain 's face that something very different had happened .
as we approached the town of nasiriya on the euphrates river , we could see that a bradley fighting vehicle had been severed in two by a missile .
two injured soldiers were loaded into the helicopter - those are the two you see in the photograph .
they did n't seem to know what had happened - they were very disorientated .
the body of the driver was put into a body bag .
one medic handed over the dog tags belonging to the dead soldier to another medic and , at this point , sergeant ken kozakiewicz realised that his best friend had been killed by " friendly fire " .
censorship fears i knew this was going to be a good picture and i wanted to get it back to my editors in saudi arabia quickly .
my only option was to send the film through the military .
i knew there was a risk that they would go into the package and possibly censor the film .
it was my worst fear .
when i got to saudi arabia , i found out that my editors had n't received the film .
i went to find the lieutenant in charge of these things .
he told me the film was being held for a period while the next of kin were informed .
i told him that the period had already expired .
i knew this lieutenant had been in vietnam and i said to him : " you know what happens in war and you are actually depriving these men of their due heroism - the fact that they had to risk their lives to fight in this war . "
the film was released but we were asked not to transmit the pictures until the military got back to us .
the editors of all the major magazines and wire services looked at the image and decided it had to be published .
it was transmitted and published in every newspaper and news magazine around the world .
from the reaction i have received from the picture , i think it resonates on many levels .

in the first of five pieces by photographers talking about their award-winning work , david turnley describes how he captured the image of a young us sergeant at the moment he learns that the body bag next to him contains the body of his friend , killed by " friendly fire " .
the widely published photo became an iconic image of the 1991 gulf war - a war in which media access was limited by pentagon restrictions .
i was on assignment with the detroit free press and us news and world report magazine .
i had originally been dispatched as part of a pool to be attached to the 82nd airborne as one of the forward-most combat photographers .
we were accompanied by a public affairs officer whose job was to make sure we stuck to pentagon restrictions .
this meant we would not be allowed to photograph casualties of war and certainly not war dead .
it became clear to me that it was going to be very difficult for me to document the reality of the war while i was out in the field , i got wind that much of the tv coverage was portraying a kind of sanitised war , one in which big technology was being used but that no human life , and particularly not american life , was at risk .
it became clear to me that it was going to be very difficult for me to document the reality of the war .
in the meantime , i had encountered an elite mash unit .
i told the head of the unit that although i had misgivings about the war , it was clear to me that this particular unit was going to serve a very vital role in helping people and i wanted to document that .
' friendly fire ' the only challenge he had was that there was n't a public affairs officer attached to the unit .
i said that was n't a problem with me if it was n't a problem with him .
so i stayed with the doctors and nurses for a few weeks and we developed a trust .

a radio communication came in and it was very clear from the expression on the captain 's face that something very different had happened .
as we approached the town of nasiriya on the euphrates river , we could see that a bradley fighting vehicle had been severed in two by a missile .
two injured soldiers were loaded into the helicopter - those are the two you see in the photograph .
they did n't seem to know what had happened - they were very disorientated .
the body of the driver was put into a body bag .
one medic handed over the dog tags belonging to the dead soldier to another medic and , at this point , sergeant ken kozakiewicz realised that his best friend had been killed by " friendly fire " .
censorship fears i knew this was going to be a good picture and i wanted to get it back to my editors in saudi arabia quickly .
my only option was to send the film through the military .
i knew there was a risk that they would go into the package and possibly censor the film .
it was my worst fear .
when i got to saudi arabia , i found out that my editors had n't received the film .
i went to find the lieutenant in charge of these things .
he told me the film was being held for a period while the next of kin were informed .
i told him that the period had already expired .
i knew this lieutenant had been in vietnam and i said to him : " you know what happens in war and you are actually depriving these men of their due heroism - the fact that they had to risk their lives to fight in this war . "
the film was released but we were asked not to transmit the pictures until the military got back to us .
the editors of all the major magazines and wire services looked at the image and decided it had to be published .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- school meal proposals : your views bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- monday , 3 october 2005 , 08:30 gmt 09:30 uk school meal proposals : your views the government is set to reveal tough guidelines on the nutritional value of school meals in england .
read an earlier section of your comments .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : " both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat " mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk " you ca n't prohibit certain food groups " laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk " after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn " brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven " parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do " jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead " roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising " robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece " what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ? "
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk " having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them " adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury " this will go some way to help with behavioural problems " david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk " vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit " damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk " i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament " dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford " it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef " nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds " who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ? "
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading " a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ? "
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire " it is a fallacy to think that children need choice " jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk " children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition " janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england " our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options " jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

read an earlier section of your comments .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?

read an earlier section of your comments .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

read an earlier section of your comments .
click here to return to the main page and send your comments .
the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .
martin roberts , abingdon , england e-mail this to a friend printable version top have your say stories should bullfighting be banned ?
should stars get involved with politics ?

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat mike , uk as a teacher in a secondary school where the vending machines were removed , there followed a dramatic improvement in the children 's behaviour .
they were no longer choc full of sugar and artificial chemicals .
research has proven that a healthy diet can have an effect on children 's behaviour but it is wrong of the government just to think the problem will go away by banning junk food in schools .
both parents and children need educating on the right foods to eat .
healthy home cooked meals do n't cost the earth -lrb- 90 % of the time they are cheaper than the processed microwave rubbish -rrb- nor do they have to take long to make .
i can usually cook one from start to finish , including all the preparation , in 20 min .
mike , uk i 'm fed up with hearing about it , let kids have a say in what they want at school .
it 's the only chance they get to eat what they want and it 's up to the parents to make sure their dinner meals at home are a healthy option .
elton johnson , dereham , norfolk i 'd like to see not only healthy food , but also more attention paid to food intolerances like dairy and nut allergies .
whilst jamie oliver has achieved nothing short of a miracle against red tape -lrb- thank you , jamie -rrb- , children on a restricted diet are still faced with very little choice .
peter , london , uk you ca n't prohibit certain food groups laura , london , uk i think it is a ridiculous ban as it will give children an unhealthy relationship with food .
you ca n't prohibit certain food groups - kids must be educated that a bit of everything in reason is a healthy diet .
as soon as you say something is bad , they 'll want it more .
eating disorders may also become a knock-on effect of this outrageous suggestion by kelly .
laura , london , uk when i was at school , everyone had school dinners , and it was a set menu .
meat and vegetables with fruit or a hot pudding for dessert .
and it was a matter of like it or lump it !
but the meals were hot , freshly prepared on the premises from fresh ingredients and did not contain pre-cooked foods or reformed meats of any kind !
for most children , it was the only decent meal they had all day !
i agree with others .
if all the children get at home is burgers and chips , that is what they will expect to eat at school .
jo , berkshire , uk it 's an interesting piece of social engineering , but dangerous .
how long before parents are banned from allowing kids to eat foods the government deem unhealthy ?
how long before our weekly shop is computer-analysed at the checkout and we 're prevented from buying it unless it 's deemed acceptable to mr blair ?
neil tonks , leicestershire , uk a really nice idea in theory .
however , as a secondary school teacher i have already seen the first signs of how pupils are planning to ' get round ' this ban .
chocolate and sweet ' dealers ' are already emerging !
dave , uk are chocolate bars and crisps to be banned from packed lunches ?
junk food is a multi million pound growing market segment that is not going to go into decline by a school ban .
in moderation it 's tasty and satisfying , not harmful .
nutritional education and awareness will help young adults make informed dietery choices .
adrian nicholls , uk after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn brian powell , newcastle , staffs as i teacher i totally agree with the ban and it is long overdue .
it has been clear for years that after their junk food lunch children are less well behaved and less likely to learn .
today 's children are so unhealthy .
as a keep fit runner of 54 years i should not beat every pupil in school on distance events but i do !
brian powell , newcastle , staffs i am an expat living in germany .
when i visit the uk , i can not believe how fat / obese people in the uk have become !
when i go to the supermarkets i also can not believe how much pre-packaged junk is for sale in the form of ready meals , frozen rubbish , sweets and crisps etc .
it 's not just kids but whole families that need re-educating to eat fresh healthy food .
david , munich , germany hi time this was banned .
schools -lrb- especially for young children -rrb- are temporary carers to whom parents trust the welfare of their children - this responsibility comes over any profit making incentives to sell junk food .
this attitude should extend to campus university canteens where the food is usually equally atrocious .
munir , guildford rather than giving children the knowledge and understanding to make an informed choice about their diet , the government seeks to impose healthy eating on students .
its about time that diet and cooking was taught in school from a very early age .
colin cheesman , abergavenny , gwent there seems to be a culture amongst secondary school pupils that it is ' not cool ' to eat in the school canteen so many pupils head to local supermarkets / shops etc for food .
if every pupil was made to stay in school to eat lunch i suspect they would have to build a huge new canteen to accommodate them !
maybe we should do as they do in germany where 2 of my daughters visited last year - school starts at 7.30 a.m. and pupils go home for lunch when school finishes at 1.30-2.00pm this way only parents can be blamed for their children 's poor diets .
geraldine evans , st andrews schools have been fighting a losing battle to get children to eat healthy foods for years , but if all they get at home is fish fingers / burger / chips etc presenting something different will always be problematic !
who will enforce the healthy eating ?
will school heads be prosecuted if crisps are found on the school site ? !
robert quayle , whitehaven parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do jean jones , stockport in my son 's high school , it is only years 7 and 8 who have to stay in school , the rest are free to go out at lunchtime .
they mainly snack on canned drinks , chips and sweets so compulsory changes would benefit them in the long run , surely .
parents at the moment have no control on what the older children do .
jean jones , stockport , cheshire down here in cornwall our school children naturally eat cornish pasties most days - the vending machines are usually stocked full of them .
this stems from the days when the local kids were trained up for the tin mines .
does ruth kelly - with her fancy ways - think she can interfere with a centuries old tradition like this ?
well i can tell her that the jethro 's and demelza 's of places like tintagel , mousehole , newquay and st ives say " never " !
izaak payne , tintagel , cornwall i am astounded anyone has criticised this .
everyone shouted that the government did nothing , yet now they have stepped in they are still wrong .
you can not legislate for people leaving school to buy their own snacks but this is where parents must step in - why have children got so much spare cash each day ?
helen , east grinstead roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising robert clark , ipswich my mother and my grandmother were both school cooks .
when my grandmother was head cook 40 years ago all food was prepared freshly every day .
potatoes were peeled and mashed and meat was cut .
my mother left after being forced to serve pre-made food .
orange tinted mash to increase time it would stay edible .
roast potatoes covered in a gel to avoid bruising in transport .
" reformed " meat .
the salt content is some of these goods is incredible .
if 40 years ago they were able to have healthy food on the menu why change it ?
it took my grandmother and three others four hours to prepare meals for 100 students .
it now takes eight staff .
somebody screwed up somewhere .
robert clark , ipswich england my son has just started junior school at a local private school .
since starting he has had chips with every meal .
if he goes for a sandwich he says he is only allowed one .
he has to choose to go on the cold or hot counter before looking at the food on offer .
why is it so difficult to feed children well ?
mark howarth , wakefield i went to a school with a tuck shop and it did n't do me any harm .
but then , i had sensible parents .
if parents were n't so obsessed with handing over all their responsibilities to the government and not taking responsibility for anything their kids do then maybe we would n't be in this ridiculous situation .
james king , coventry , uk the only way to stop younger children eating crisps and chocolate bars at lunch times is for parents to stop putting them into lunch boxes .
however the biggest problem has to be children in secondary schools whose kitchens serve food macdonalds would be proud of .
kelly , hampshire , uk one of my close friends discovered the equivalent of today 's vending machine while she was at school and has been having weight-related problems since .
while there may be other contributing factors , there is no doubt that her early encounters with a constant supply of junk food within her school ground set the ball rolling for 25 years of being overweight .
el , london , uk this is typical from a government that is continually desperate to make political capital .
dr s patel , london i recall having very nice freshly cooked school meals back in the 1970s .
then there was a change in policy in the 1980s and we were shifted onto " fast food " of burgers , hot dogs and chips .
i used to take my dinner money and go out to the hgh sreet and buy decent fresh food and fruit .
20 years later , it 's come full circle - what took them so long ?
ken , athens , greece what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
ranjan , leeds has anyone thought of what is the alternative item to be stored in these vending machines ?
most healthy items -lrb- vegetables ? -rrb- are highly perishable and will not be appealing .
sweets need to be a treat , not food .
maybe the government could think of increasing tax on unhealthy items so that people buy them only on occasions .
ranjan , leeds , uk these are children are in school not to munch but to learn .
of course they 'll still eat crisps , chocolate , fizzy drinks outside of school - but nobody can convince me that preventing them from doing so for six hours is seriously infringing their ' choices ' or ' human rights ' !
jen , hawkwell , uk having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them adele , uk brilliant news !
the companies that produce this rubbish already bombard our children with far too much advertising .
having vending machines in schools gives the impression that we 're endorsing them .
children can only learn what we teach them , and the eating habits we develop when we 're young will affect our health for life .
adele , uk it is n't a case of banning chocolate bars , it is about providing healthy meals .
most parents do n't mind if their children have a chocolate bar as a snack providing they get a healthy main meal .
it says something about this government that things only start to happen when a television personality gets involved !
paul s , essex excellent news - my boy has just gone from a primary school that had a very high standard of food , to a senior school that serves only junk ... after only three weeks there is a clear difference in his concentration .
i hope this work continues .
thank you jamie oliver and the department for listening and acting .
becky , kent the " no sugary drinks " could be misleading as it would exclude diet drinks that are loaded with other foul chemicals rather than plain sugar .
al , twells , uk yes , feed the kids fruit , salads , water .
when it comes to studying , do n't be surprised when they do n't have any energy to do the brain work .
when it comes to exams , i give my kids chocolates and fatty foods for the energy .
they always do well !
z hussain , bromley laughable .
when i go shopping at 8am there are loads of school kids milling around the supermarket buying sweets , chocolate etc. so i imagine when this legislation comes in there 'll just be more .
helen , aylesbury this will go some way to help with behavioural problems david , surrey this will go some way to help with behavioural problems , closely associated with elevated intake of sugar !
good move i say !
david , surrey i am a teacher in japan who eats school lunch everyday .
the government needs to take some lessons from the japanese school lunch system - fresh fish and rice everyday keeps the children healthy - not a chocolate bar in sight !
roshan , saitama , japan banning junk food just is n't the answer to the growing problem of obesity within the uk 's youth .
school dinners account for only one meal a day , and only on week days , too .
the impact it will actually have is minimal .
unless parents stop feeding their children junk food at home , and taking them to fast food places , this problem is going to continue to grow , no matter what the government regulates within school .
nick , surrey , uk it is ridiculous , kids will just bring in junk food and cafeteria companies will go down .
also , at our local school , healthy meals have been introduced but they are really expensive and pe has gradually been cut from 3hrs a week two years ago to only 1 hour a week now .
surely this needs to be addressed or else the government is just shooting itself in the foot daniel wood , warrington uk how about some comments from the consumers - the school children ?
it 's well & good all us adults spouting how great it is to have healthy food for kids and ban all junk food at school and in vend machines .
i remember the tuck shops & corner shops doing a sterling business selling sweets , chocolates , crisps etc to us schoolchildren , now the adults - where did the money come from - the parents .
it wo n't change .
this smacks of punishment & panic for votes rather than education , good funding and reasoned approach .
sandy montgomery , sussex i was mildly amused to see that someone thinks the ban is an ' infringement of children 's human rights ' .
what utter nonsense .
children should be brought up with good , sound values in all aspects of life ; that does n't mean giving them the same rights as adults .
they do n't have the experience or willpower to handle temptation .
parents have a duty to provide proper guidance .
children certainly do n't have a right to junk food .
june , birmingham , uk vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit damian allinson , leeds , uk this is definitely good news .
i hope people have the courage to implement the plan .
parents - you are responsible for your child 's health in and out of school .
vending companies will adapt to offer healthy snacks in order to profit .
damian allinson , leeds , uk it 's a step in the right direction , but as others have pointed out , there are many other avenues available to children for their junk food fix .
if we want to stop the tide of obesity that is engulfing the western world , another step could be to introduce mandatory physical education as part of the daily national school curriculum .
sanjay , london this is great news for children and in the long term great news for the uk .
bad eating habits wo n't be learnt in schools which will , in time , lead to adults with healthier eating habits -lrb- and thus increase the demand for healthy food -rrb- .
it 's frustrating how much food being sold in this country is unhealthy , but people keep on buying it because they 're used to it .
hopefully greater demand for healthy food options will lead to an increase in the supply .
rudi , london , uk it is a good idea to take away the vending machines but what will replace them ?
there needs to be a substitute !
antionette , mitcham , surrey i remember years ago , my father , who worked as a school dental officer , being horrified when the school installed a kit-kat vending machine a few yards along the corridor from his surgery .
he told the head teacher that a condom machine would have been a better use of space .
alastair , reading well it 's not worth much if they then get home and are fed turkey twizzlers and chips is it ?
and do n't use the ' fussy eater ' excuse either as all kids would be - what is in front of them should be eaten and that 's that .
that 's how it was for me and i am grateful to my mother for ensuring that i now -lrb- at 30 -rrb- have healthy teeth and bones and am the correct weight for my height .
higher tax for those that are overweight through gluttony would make a huge difference .
marie , surrey , uk i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament dave pashby , leeds , uk what rot .
parents should be leading on healthy eating , then children follow .
and if children eat healthily at home why should n't they have a chocolate biscuit at lunch time .
parents will just move more to packed lunches , and feed the children what they will eat .
how long until health food is enforced for hospital patients .
i bet they do n't ban junk food in the houses of parliament .
dave pashby , leeds , uk my daughter -lrb- 9 on saturday -rrb- gets a choice of food for school dinners , and is proud of her preference for the ' healthy option ' when available .
but she gets good food at home -lrb- my husband is a former chef -rrb- and when she watched " jamie 's school dinners " with us she was startled at how few children could identify fruits and vegetables .
megan , cheshire uk yet more well intentioned and futile social engineering !
everyone knows junk food is bad - but they still eat it .
banning it from schools means children will get it somewhere else .
surely the role of a democratic government is to supply information and then let people -lrb- even children -rrb- make their own choices - even bad choices , or are we all happy with a government that compels us to follow the behaviour it decrees as correct .
where do we draw that line , what next , compulsory walking to school , forced attendance at citizenship classes ?
ken charman , wokingham , uk i think that it wo n't solve the problem at all .
the roots are in what we show to kids , namely having a quick lunch with sandwich , crisps and a fizzy drink at our computer screen , or even worse , no lunch at all .
what kind of example do we set ?
let 's have a decent break where adults and kids can also sit down and relax at lunch .
david , bradford it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef nick , reading , uk well of course it 's a good idea .
however , it would be nice if the government had some original ideas of their own rather than relying on a tv chef to point out the glaringly obvious .
perhaps , now they 're being fed properly , the government could look at educating them properly or does that require another celebrity to inject some common sense into the government 's thinking first ?
nick , reading , uk it 's pointless to ban junk food , most schools are near town centres and all the children will do is sneak out and buy the food there instead .
or bring it in with them on the way to school .
they need to work on making the healthier food more appealing to kids .
banning something makes it far more interesting and attractive and will just increase the amount the children eat .
kaz winton , devizes , wiltshire jamie oliver 's plan included a cookery boot camp for under-trained dinner staff .
do the education secretary 's plans include staff retraining costs or will they simply introduce the ban and leave the ill-equipped staff to get on with it ?
lee , crewe my son started school this september and his school meals are excellent .
the main problem with school meals is that they are outsourced to companies who need to make a profit , instead of being run by the lea .
being a chef i know that if these companies are getting 50p per child per day to feed them and make a profit , that the profit will come first .
we need the lea to take control away from outsourced companies and into a non profit organisation so the child can get the best possible .
david shaw , bradford freedom of choice should not be an issue here .
junk food is bad , especially when over-indulged in .
can there really be a single parent out there who would take risks with their child 's health just to demonstrate their right to chose .
ken , bournemouth uk when i was at school -lrb- only 10 years ago -rrb- there was no vending machines .
how did we cope ?
my mum packed me an apple and piece of home made cake in my bag every day , and in the autumn we were allowed to pick our own apple from their trees .
we did however take a packed lunch as the school dinners were unhealthy and being brought up on healthy food , were bland and unappealing .
we also had to have a permit , requiring a letter from our parents and a valid reason to be allowed out of school at lunch and break times .
liz , leeds who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
kevin , bracknell , uk a good idea , in theory .
as a school governor , i have seen a decline in the number of children having school meals .
i feel that parents will give in , and send children with lunch boxes full of the junk food which is going to be banned .
who is going to check the content of the lunch boxes ?
also , as a governor of a school without a kitchen , which has to use an outside caterer how do we monitor the food content ?
governors are volunteers , most of whom work during the day , and spend their evenings working hard on all the other government initiatives .
i agree with the motives , but we give up enough of our time and should n't be given yet another job .
kevin , bracknell , uk although i agree children should be encouraged to eat more healthily i think that these measures are tantamount to an infringement of human rights .
who on earth do the labour government believe they are banning certain foods when clearly the correct way forward is to educate children to make their own choices ?
if you tell an 8-year-old child that they are not allowed crisps for example then i guarantee they will eat them at every opportunity outside school .
a free society is based on individual choice and it is the responsibility of government to ensure people have all the education and facts to make the correct one not to just impose their opinions without consultation .
what next ?
a ban on alcohol or tobacco sales ?
i think not - too much tax revenue there .
nick , london it 's great that finally the standard of school dinners is improving , but i ca n't help notice that yet again lazy parents are more than willing to blame schools and the government , when they are taking no action themselves .
if they ca n't trust their children to do what is right by the time they are going to school , then it 's too late anyway .
parents - take some responsibility for a change !
simon , oxford , england great news - and not before time .
i have nothing against vending machines , only the contents within !
let 's have some imagination here ; most kids will eat something healthy .
stock up the machines with unsalted nuts , sunflower seeds , vegetable crisps cooked in olive oil , packs of raisins , apples , pears , bananas , grapes , bananas etc .
and chilled mineral water or dilute fruit juices - delicious !
susie , lincoln , uk though the ban is a good thing i do n't think it will actually help .
parents that cared about their children 's nutrition were already feeding them healthy food , while those that allowed their children to eat junk will continue to do so through lunch-boxes and meals at home .
it 's the parents that need to be taught not the children .
nicola , reading a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading pukka !
my son 's school has just switched caterers and the new lunches would n't be out of place in a restaurant .
astonishingly , the boys now look forward to lunchtime .
a school 's purpose is to educate : why should n't that extend to the palate ?
john lancashire , reading , uk history will record that for the first time the government began to dictate to the people what was good for them and what they should eat and that the people of this country just accepted it .
what will it be next ?
banning certain books because their ideas are perceived to be potentially harmful ?
the role of government is to run the country , it is not the role of government to dictate to the individual .
mike regan , fareham , england i have three children ages 2 , 8 and 10 and they have a healthy balanced diet .
the main thing that i am trying to teach then is moderation .
they can have crisps , chocolates and sweets but in moderation .
we need to teach this to all children .
an excess of any food is bad for you .
claire holliman , bramley , hants as a school dinner lady working in a primary school and middle school on introducing healthy school meals in september i have found that children are complaining what is being served up and therefore school dinner numbers have decreased and more pack lunches are being brought into school .
also by putting up the price of school dinners an extra 10p that it may put parents of paying it .
staff are having to be cut and extra work put onto other employees within the kitchen so therefore standards are being dropped as more work has to be done within so many hours with less staff .
mrs s baugh , wolverhampton thank goodness the government has taken this step .
we now need to educate the parents in healthy eating so they do n't slowly kill their children by feeding them salt laden / additive laden junk .
while we 're at it , why not tackle the manufacturers that produce this rubbish so that they sell food which is beneficial to children and adults ?
v darlington , sudbury hill , middlesex this is a very positive step .
on a recent tour of a secondary school as a prospective parent , i was dismayed to see vending machines selling fizzy drinks and confectionary .
my children 's primary school has recently made a great effort to introduce a healthy eating policy , giving careful guidelines about snacks that can be taken in each day .
it would be a terrible shame for all this good work to be undone as soon as they move up to the next school .
jane bartlett , brighton & hove , england in the us children bring their own " snacks " from home for morning -lrb- or afternoon -rrb- break .
in addition , a nutritious hot lunch is served by the school with 2-3 choices .
children also have the option to bring a packed lunch from home .
vending machines are not permitted in the schools .
parents would never stand to have their children 's health compromised for profit .
furthermore , children in the us never leave school grounds for any reason .
why in the world are british children permitted to leave school to go to the corner store to buy a snack ?
j. speak , doylestown , p a i fully support this ban .
vending machines are a major source of concern amongst parents .
my son has just started at a state school with excellent and good value in house catering .
i know it can be done .
for the first time he has forsaken packed lunches and now wants the school hot meals .
lynne porter , cricklade england and about time .
the only people that complain about this are the people who have a " fussy eater " !
kids are only fussy eaters if they are trained to be .
introducing new foods at an early stage stops all this .
is n't it frustrating though that you can go out for a nice meal with great food - only to look at the menu and see that the kids menu .
why not just serve smaller portions .
you do n't see our european counter parts feeding sub standard food into their kids !
graham dodgson , silsden , west yorkshire it is a fallacy to think that children need choice jonathan , edinburgh , scotland my son went to school in spain for a while .
there they had no almost choice about what to eat , the food served was healthy , and the pupils had to eat most of it .
this forced him to try various things he normally refused , and he realised that some of them were quite nice .
it is a fallacy to think that children need choice !
jonathan , edinburgh , scotland i have two toddlers and so am hopeful that food standards will have improved by the time they get to school .
however fruit and vegetables can still be very low quality with next to no nutritional value .
i would like to see a move to locally produced organic where possible .
also teach the kids why certain foods are good or bad for you rather than just telling them what not to eat and giving no reasons .
david briggs , bristol i set up a healthy vending company for schools 8 months ago and now have a few machines around the uk .
the snacks are low and low to moderate in sugar , salt and saturated fat in accordance with government guidelines .
it is difficult to get healthy vending machines into schools because the schools are worried that the healthy products wo n't sell as well as the unhealthy products .
we know from experience that they do .
justin wride , cheltenham , england the key is to have good quality , nutritious meals served at lunchtime and wider education to parents , many of whom still pour junk food down their children 's throats when they get home , because it 's ' quick ' .
banning vending machines ?
daft - most schools have sweet shops on the door steps !
bring back student-run tuck shops at morning break ; they 're cheaper , children do n't have to leave school premises and they teach a modicum of business sense to those who volunteer to run them .
sean , bath , uk children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition janice hopkins , windsor , uk great news !
children can not be expected to learn when their little bodies and minds are struggling because of poor nutrition .
it 's so obvious .
why has it taken so long ?
janice hopkins , windsor , uk improving the quality of ingredients is only half the equation .
they need to be prepared and cooked to acceptable standards by staff who are not only properly trained , but who also really care about making good food .
my son complains that the vegetables are mushy and tasteless and other food is often bland .
i 'm not wasting hard-earned money on feeding him pap - all children deserve better .
ike , stroud , uk this could turn out to be a partially bad decision .
they 've missed the fact that schools make considerable money from allowing ' junk food ' vending machines on their premises .
the government needs to indicate how it will help cover the resulting shortfall in extra cash from this decision .
patrick leahy , churchill college , cambridge school meals should reflect and promote current healthy eating guidelines .
providing high fat , salt or sugar meals and snacks less frequently , perhaps once or twice each week instead of all day every day .
mark , staffordshire , england excellent !
from watching the jamie oliver program i 'm fairly certain there will be a few whinging children -lrb- and parents too -rrb- but finally for those parents who do try to teach their children about healthy eating , all will not be lost when their child begins school .
and parents , please do n't rebel by packing your kids lunch instead , full of sweeties !
sophie , crewe , cheshire thank goodness for a bit of common sense , at last .
i find it incredible seeing the rubbish people -lrb- in general -rrb- are willing to allow their children , with developing minds and bodies , to consume rather than spend more time and thought -lrb- and perhaps money -rrb- on food preparation .
robert , worthing this whole eating issue is part of the wider issue of parents without the skills , the will or the ability to bring up their children properly .
how long do we have to wait before parenting skills and child care , including nutritional issues , are an integral part of the school curriculum ?
peter smith , crewe , cheshire i am all for preventing the sale of high salt , high sugar , high fat foods in schools .
however , do be aware of the dangers of no sugar fizzy drinks .
the additives usually mean there is virtually no nutritional value and the acidity inhibits the absorption of calcium into the bones .
moira hoffman , bolton , england this is most certainly a step in the right direction .
you only have to look around you in some schools today to realize that the children 's eating habits are far from ideal .
this move will only have positive results .
bijou kalayil , london , england as a new zealander i was appalled when my teacher friends told me of the unhealthy diets that most parents allow their children to eat .
one of the aspects of this issue that seems to be over looked as the role that parents have in this problem .
do parents care enough about their children to teach them the benefits of health eating and a healthy life style ?
i would say that most kids that eat unhealthy food also have parents that eat unhealthy food .
anand reddy , london , uk bah humbug !
what is wrong with a bit of junk food now and again ?
what about informed choice ?
no tuck shops ?
i used to look forward with glee to my mid morning chocolate snacks !
it 's political correctness gone mad !
paul scrafton , sunderland , uk although i regret that it has come to a ban to solve a problem i am pleased that an effort is being made to address a serious problem , i am also pleased that it serves to undermine the insidious corporate marketing / sponsorship which is creeping into our schools .
i hope that some real imagination goes into providing attractive healthy food so that not only are children unable to access junk food but they will develop a preference for healthy food .
peter wray , northwich as a father of two young children , one of which started school a few weeks ago , i am delighted that junk food will be banned .
if the children wo n't eat school dinners , some parents may revert to unhealthy food in lunch boxes instead .
stopping children bringing unhealthy food in their lunch boxes will be a more difficult problem to stop .
john humphreys , winsford , england our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options jbs , portsmouth , uk i am not so sure if this will work with children .
many of the children in my school eat healthily as our school canteen now provides healthy food but it is at least twice as expensive as the unhealthy options and now people are bring in their own unhealthy chocolate bars etc .
i think this will only work if they make health eating a universal thing not just in schools .
perhaps higher taxes on junk foods ?
jbs , portsmouth , uk i 'm very pleased that this is going ahead but the strong issue of where our food comes from should also me on the government 's menu .
teach children how food is prepared and where it comes from and we might wake up the appalling suffering most animals suffer before slaughter .
or is it not politically right to say to a child that they are eating a chemically fed 6 week old chick dressed as a chicken ?
richard morris , essex is this the ' no choice ' agenda on food ?
pupils will soon see the hypocrisy of adults -lrb- teachers and parents -rrb- eating sugar or salt ladened food .
education is about informed choice , not prescription ' .
mike steer , st austell , cornwall yes - ban it !
teachers have a hard enough job without making it harder by allowing kids to go hyper on sugar all day long .
alex , camberley , england my children are 6 , 5 and 2 .
i am very glad these proposals are to be introduced .
it can not happen quickly enough .
there is already a very high standard of food at my local infant school but i did have concerns about the ' tuck shop ' at the junior and senior schools .
during holidays , the kids also attend ofsted registered play schemes and their ' tuck ' is appalling .
most drinks are bright red or blue and they only sell sweets .
would this spread to these kind of operations too ?
sharon hadland , eastbourne , east sussex an excellent idea in principal but the profiteering supermarkets will be rubbing their hands in glee .
parents will no doubt give into their children 's demands and just buy the fizzy drinks , chocolate bars and crisps from them instead to keep the kids quiet .
natalie , birmingham , uk that 's all good and well , but in my school it was a 2 minute walk across the road to the local newsagents where he stocked the biggest selection of chocolate ... and a 10 minute walk to the local town where there were at least 4 different fish and chip restaurants .
it 's a good idea , and it 'll stop the government getting in trouble , but really it 's more underlying than that .
more pt i say !
more sport , more grass pitches , more fun !
stuart , edinburgh , scotland it 's not before time .
i only hope the same will be adopted in this country .
kenneth gray , rockingham , western australia i know children have to have a balanced diet , but we send out children to school to be taught , not to go through their lunch boxes and what happens if you have a fussy eater or a child who is allergic to the food on the school menu ?
nicolina stangoni , taunton , somerset i am a father of 2 boys aged 2 and 4 and i definitely feel this is the way forward .
how can we encourage our children to eat healthily when schools are serving most of the foods we discourage in our homes ?
this is good news for parents .

thomas hamilton murdered 16 pupils and a teacher at dunblane primary school on 13 march , 1996 .
scotland 's senior law officer , lord advocate colin boyd qc , announced last week that the 100-year restriction on most of the documents would be lifted and they would be made available for public viewing at the national archives of scotland .

in the fourth of five pieces by photographers talking about their award-winning work , erik refner describes how he captured the moving image of a one-year-old refugee from afghanistan being prepared for burial in 2001 .
erik refner 's winning photo enlarge image the child 's family , originally from northern afghanistan , had sought refuge from the political situation and the drought afflicting the country .
roger hutchings , chairman of the world press photo jury , wrote of refner 's picture : " the picture he made reached out to us .
it is simple , iconic and symbolic .
it points towards matters which need to be addressed and , with the benefit of hindsight , it reproaches us for having ignored afghanistan since the end of the cold war .
it also reminds us what a photographer is . "
in 2001 , i was working as an intern at the danish newspaper , the berlingske tidende .
at the time , there was almost nothing about the afghan refugees , although it was one of the biggest refugee problems in the world .
i went to my editor with a proposal to cover the situation and he accepted it .
i went to a refugee camp close to peshawar , near the afghan border .
there were around 90,000 refugees there , partly because of the political situation and partly because of the drought in the northern part of the country .
the child looks like he has a little smile around his mouth as - if he has finally gone to a better place i had been in the camp for about two weeks .
i was n't allowed to stay there at night , so i had told my translator to keep his eyes and ears open .
one morning he told me about a family he knew , whose one-year-old boy had died in the camp .
the family had been to the medecins sans frontieres tent to collect a white shroud and a tombstone .
we went into the tent where the male members of the family had started to prepare the child 's body for burial .
i briefly paid my condolences to the father , than i asked him if it was ok for me to take the pictures .
sadness according to tradition , it is the men who prepare the body .
in this case , it was the child 's father , his brother and an imam .
those are the arms that you can see in the picture .
everything happened very quickly - the ceremony took around 10 minutes .
i was sitting on the ground shooting pictures and then taking them from above .
i have always tried to portray the innocent people caught up in the conflict , i do n't do this hard-core news journalism it was a difficult situation - there was a lot of sadness .
i could hear the women crying in another tent .
i was trying not to intrude in anyone 's grief .
then , everyone went outside and the men carried the body about 2km -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- to a graveyard outside the camp .
the judges described the picture as symbolic and iconic .
i still get a lot of response from the picture - when you 've seen it you wo n't forget it .
it 's very simple and very powerful .
there is the strong contrast between the white cloth and the dark arms .
the child looks like he has a little smile around his mouth - as if he has finally gone to a better place .
then there is the fact that it is old people burying a young child - it should be the other way around .
there is a lot of symbolism in that picture .
all these things make it very powerful .
i have always tried to portray the innocent people caught up in the conflict , i do n't do this hard-core news journalism .
i would rather shoot the ones who are affected by a crisis .
i have also done projects in congo and sudan .
i knew the moment i took it , it was a good picture .
i kind of remembered the picture at the time , but when i got back home i saw it i thought it was even more powerful than i had remembered .
the picture was published a few weeks after it was taken , as part of a photo essay .
in terms of other parts of the world where i would like to go , i think chechnya does n't appear to have the interest of the media .
of course , it 's a very difficult place , but i think it 's an important story and i would like to tell it .

at the time , there was almost nothing about the afghan refugees , although it was one of the biggest refugee problems in the world .
i went to my editor with a proposal to cover the situation and he accepted it .
i went to a refugee camp close to peshawar , near the afghan border .
there were around 90,000 refugees there , partly because of the political situation and partly because of the drought in the northern part of the country .
the child looks like he has a little smile around his mouth as - if he has finally gone to a better place i had been in the camp for about two weeks .
i was n't allowed to stay there at night , so i had told my translator to keep his eyes and ears open .
one morning he told me about a family he knew , whose one-year-old boy had died in the camp .
the family had been to the medecins sans frontieres tent to collect a white shroud and a tombstone .
we went into the tent where the male members of the family had started to prepare the child 's body for burial .
i briefly paid my condolences to the father , than i asked him if it was ok for me to take the pictures .
sadness according to tradition , it is the men who prepare the body .
in this case , it was the child 's father , his brother and an imam .
those are the arms that you can see in the picture .
everything happened very quickly - the ceremony took around 10 minutes .
i was sitting on the ground shooting pictures and then taking them from above .
i have always tried to portray the innocent people caught up in the conflict , i do n't do this hard-core news journalism it was a difficult situation - there was a lot of sadness .
i could hear the women crying in another tent .
i was trying not to intrude in anyone 's grief .
then , everyone went outside and the men carried the body about 2km -lrb- 1.2 miles -rrb- to a graveyard outside the camp .
the judges described the picture as symbolic and iconic .
i still get a lot of response from the picture - when you 've seen it you wo n't forget it .
it 's very simple and very powerful .
there is the strong contrast between the white cloth and the dark arms .
the child looks like he has a little smile around his mouth - as if he has finally gone to a better place .
then there is the fact that it is old people burying a young child - it should be the other way around .
there is a lot of symbolism in that picture .
all these things make it very powerful .
i have always tried to portray the innocent people caught up in the conflict , i do n't do this hard-core news journalism .
i would rather shoot the ones who are affected by a crisis .
i have also done projects in congo and sudan .
i knew the moment i took it , it was a good picture .
i kind of remembered the picture at the time , but when i got back home i saw it i thought it was even more powerful than i had remembered .
the picture was published a few weeks after it was taken , as part of a photo essay .
in terms of other parts of the world where i would like to go , i think chechnya does n't appear to have the interest of the media .
of course , it 's a very difficult place , but i think it 's an important story and i would like to tell it .

the new development comes as a result of observations made with the keck observatory on mauna kea , hawaii .
michael brown , from the california institute of technology , us , says the find will help his team make a better determination of the new planet 's mass .
currently , the planet has been dubbed xena ; the moon will be called gabrielle until official names are agreed .
both " codenames " come from characters in a us tv series , xena : warrior princess .
" since the day we discovered xena , the big question has been whether or not it has a moon , " professor brown said in a statement .
" having a moon is just inherently cool - and it is something that most self-respecting planets have , so it is good to see that this one does , too . "
big debate xena -lrb- it also has the designation 2003 ub313 -rrb- has a highly elliptical orbit .
it is currently 14.5 billion km -lrb- 9 billion miles -rrb- away , about 97 times further away than the earth is from the sun .
the orbit is also tilted roughly 45 degrees above the orbital plane of the other planets .
kuiper belt objects icy planetary bodies that orbit beyond neptune in the distant region of the solar system more than 400 such objects are currently known they are believed to be remnants of the formation of the solar system and among the most primitive objects available for study the astonishing find has reignited the debate about what properties an object has to possess in order to be classed as a planet .
in xena 's favour is its size .
with a diameter of perhaps 2,800km -lrb- 1,700 miles -rrb- , it is bigger than pluto -lrb- 2,390km ; 1,500 miles -rrb- , which has long had planet status .
but this in itself will not be enough to convince doubters .
there are many scientists who believe that both xena and pluto are merely two largish objects in a huge population of rock-ice bodies orbiting the sun in the far-distant region of the solar system known as the kuiper belt .
to call them all planets would diminish the status of the truly massive bodies closer to the sun , so the argument goes .
hubble 's eye and having a moon is unlikely to push this debate further forward , as possession of a satellite is no guide to a planet 's importance .
both mercury and venus are devoid of moons , whereas some asteroids are known to have smaller rocks moving around them .
an artist 's concept of the 10th planet and its moon indeed , professor brown said he expected to find a moon orbiting xena because many of the kuiper belt objects so far discovered also have companions .
gabrielle was seen using a 10m telescope at the wm keck observatory on 10 september .
that it exists and orbits close to xena is about all scientists know about the moon right now .
professor brown 's team expects to learn more when it gets time on the hubble space telescope in november .
gabrielle 's discovery will be reported officially in a scientific paper submitted to the astrophysical journal .

the new development comes as a result of observations made with the keck observatory on mauna kea , hawaii .
michael brown , from the california institute of technology , us , says the find will help his team make a better determination of the new planet 's mass .
currently , the planet has been dubbed xena ; the moon will be called gabrielle until official names are agreed .
both " codenames " come from characters in a us tv series , xena : warrior princess .
" since the day we discovered xena , the big question has been whether or not it has a moon , " professor brown said in a statement .
" having a moon is just inherently cool - and it is something that most self-respecting planets have , so it is good to see that this one does , too . "
big debate xena -lrb- it also has the designation 2003 ub313 -rrb- has a highly elliptical orbit .
it is currently 14.5 billion km -lrb- 9 billion miles -rrb- away , about 97 times further away than the earth is from the sun .
the orbit is also tilted roughly 45 degrees above the orbital plane of the other planets .
kuiper belt objects icy planetary bodies that orbit beyond neptune in the distant region of the solar system more than 400 such objects are currently known they are believed to be remnants of the formation of the solar system and among the most primitive objects available for study the astonishing find has reignited the debate about what properties an object has to possess in order to be classed as a planet .
in xena 's favour is its size .
with a diameter of perhaps 2,800km -lrb- 1,700 miles -rrb- , it is bigger than pluto -lrb- 2,390km ; 1,500 miles -rrb- , which has long had planet status .
but this in itself will not be enough to convince doubters .
there are many scientists who believe that both xena and pluto are merely two largish objects in a huge population of rock-ice bodies orbiting the sun in the far-distant region of the solar system known as the kuiper belt .
to call them all planets would diminish the status of the truly massive bodies closer to the sun , so the argument goes .
hubble 's eye and having a moon is unlikely to push this debate further forward , as possession of a satellite is no guide to a planet 's importance .
both mercury and venus are devoid of moons , whereas some asteroids are known to have smaller rocks moving around them .
indeed , professor brown said he expected to find a moon orbiting xena because many of the kuiper belt objects so far discovered also have companions .
gabrielle was seen using a 10m telescope at the wm keck observatory on 10 september .
that it exists and orbits close to xena is about all scientists know about the moon right now .
professor brown 's team expects to learn more when it gets time on the hubble space telescope in november .
gabrielle 's discovery will be reported officially in a scientific paper submitted to the astrophysical journal .

the jab is free to vulnerable groups , such as the elderly and children over six months who have asthma , diabetes or a weakened immune system .
last year 30 % of over-65s and half of children at increased risk did not have a jab .
the vaccination is available from your local gp .
flu flu is estimated to kill several thousand people in the uk each year 10-15 % of the population develop flu each year 100,000 flu particles can be projected into the air with just one sneeze in 12 hours , the flu virus can invade 1 million nose and throat cells flu is highly infectious .
a sneeze can carry the flu virus and , travelling at 80 miles per hour , reach distances of up to 30 feet away .
touching objects such as toys that have been coughed or sneezed on can also pass on flu .
sir liam donaldson , the chief medical officer for england , said : " there is a big difference between a cold and flu - thousands of deaths are linked to flu every year .
" flu tends to last for up to two weeks , giving you fevers , chills , extreme fatigue and aching muscles as well as the more cold-like symptoms of sore throats and runny noses .
" if you are 65 years or older , or you suffer from illnesses such as asthma , diabetes or serious heart or kidney disease you are particularly at risk from flu .
" for those most at risk , flu can lead to more serious illnesses , including bronchitis or pneumonia and could result in hospitalisation or , in the most serious cases , death . "
sir liam stressed that at-risk groups needed to get a flu jab every year , as the flu virus is constantly changing .
asthma attack alpa chhipa , whose asthmatic son contracted flu when he was two , said : " my son miraj developed flu which brought on an uncontrollable asthma attack .
" it was so frightening as he was too young to tell me what was wrong and how bad he felt .
" miraj was rushed into accident and emergency at our local hospital and was in hospital for three days while they tried to bring his asthma under control using a combination of steroids and antibiotics .
" miraj now has a flu jab every autumn in preparation for the winter and he has definitely benefited from this .
" i would recommend that anyone who has a child with asthma discusses having the flu jab with their gp .
it does n't make sense to leave it to chance . "
flu jabs are also free to residents in long-stay residential care homes and carers of older or disabled people whose health is at risk if their carer falls ill .
the jab should not be given to people who have a serious allergy to hens ' eggs , or who have ever had a serious allergic reaction the flu vaccine in the past .

few can believe that the " island of the gods " has been attacked again .
three years ago this month bali suffered a similar attack , which killed more than 200 people .
many believe the recovery this time around will take much longer and be much harder .
" i feel i am dead , i have no chance anymore in bali looking for a job , " said agus , a 35-year-old tour guide originally from neighbouring east java .
" i 'm sure in the next few years , i must go back to java to look for a job , because i ca n't stay here : i ca n't survive . "
click here for a graph of bali tourism trends tourists are divided in their response .
a number have already left , some on evacuation flights laid on by australia and singapore .
but officials say that images beamed around the world of long queues at the airport on sunday morning were misleading , because many of those leaving had reached the end of their holidays anyway .
perhaps surprisingly , other visitors have stayed .
anneke gommers from the netherlands said that while she was a little worried by the bombs , she would not be leaving .
staying on " the balinese people can not help it .
it 's terrible for them and if everyone goes , they will have nothing .
they are so friendly and kindly , " she said , adding that she was still intending to come back next year for another extended stay .
some tourists have decided to stay on , despite the attacks ms gommers was speaking outside a starbucks cafe , near the site of the kuta square bombing .
she said she had been reassured by the increased security since the bomb attack .
" i was in the shopping centre , and when i arrived the police searched my bag , and it was the same for everyone .
i think it 's safe , " she said .
inside the cafe , the effects of the bomb were also being keenly felt .
" business is very , very bad , " said wayan , the manager .
in the immediate aftermath of the october 2002 bombing , hotel bookings fell by 80 % , flights arrived and left empty , and shop owners put their staff on half pay .
it has taken three years of hard work to convince tourists to come back to the island - hard work that was undone in an instant on saturday night .
the struggle out of the trough following the first bombing sapped a lot of the island 's economic resilience , and it remains to be seen how much stamina is left to cope with the aftermath of these new attacks .
two days after the bombs , the hotels are still relatively full , but people are cancelling their holidays and the next few months are critical .
many people in bali fear that tourists who were willing to discount the first attack as a one-off anomaly will see two bombings as a pattern - and that the island 's tourism industry will wither before they return .

few can believe that the " island of the gods " has been attacked again .
three years ago this month bali suffered a similar attack , which killed more than 200 people .
many believe the recovery this time around will take much longer and be much harder .
" i feel i am dead , i have no chance anymore in bali looking for a job , " said agus , a 35-year-old tour guide originally from neighbouring east java .
" i 'm sure in the next few years , i must go back to java to look for a job , because i ca n't stay here : i ca n't survive . "
click here for a graph of bali tourism trends tourists are divided in their response .
a number have already left , some on evacuation flights laid on by australia and singapore .
but officials say that images beamed around the world of long queues at the airport on sunday morning were misleading , because many of those leaving had reached the end of their holidays anyway .
perhaps surprisingly , other visitors have stayed .
anneke gommers from the netherlands said that while she was a little worried by the bombs , she would not be leaving .
staying on " the balinese people can not help it .
it 's terrible for them and if everyone goes , they will have nothing .
they are so friendly and kindly , " she said , adding that she was still intending to come back next year for another extended stay .
some tourists have decided to stay on , despite the attacks ms gommers was speaking outside a starbucks cafe , near the site of the kuta square bombing .
she said she had been reassured by the increased security since the bomb attack .
" i was in the shopping centre , and when i arrived the police searched my bag , and it was the same for everyone .
i think it 's safe , " she said .
inside the cafe , the effects of the bomb were also being keenly felt .
" business is very , very bad , " said wayan , the manager .
in the immediate aftermath of the october 2002 bombing , hotel bookings fell by 80 % , flights arrived and left empty , and shop owners put their staff on half pay .
it has taken three years of hard work to convince tourists to come back to the island - hard work that was undone in an instant on saturday night .
the struggle out of the trough following the first bombing sapped a lot of the island 's economic resilience , and it remains to be seen how much stamina is left to cope with the aftermath of these new attacks .
two days after the bombs , the hotels are still relatively full , but people are cancelling their holidays and the next few months are critical .
many people in bali fear that tourists who were willing to discount the first attack as a one-off anomaly will see two bombings as a pattern - and that the island 's tourism industry will wither before they return .
