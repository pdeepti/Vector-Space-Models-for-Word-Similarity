program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2005 anti-racism groups slam german ads back to first page back 2/2 ad industry denies accusations the german advertising industry denies accusations of being racially insensitive .
michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for penisplus , a site for surgical penis enlargements .
the ad won an advertising award in 2003 .
others say that average germans are also to blame .
" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .
" but to hear and see the mainstream public sphere in germany , you ’ d think that all germans are white . " sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de colonial cliches in a german zoo ?

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .

" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for penisplus , a site for surgical penis enlargements .
the ad won an advertising award in 2003 .
others say that average germans are also to blame .
" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .

selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .

the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .

" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .

selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .

" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

can they successfully take on the us ? for years , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the russians planned on creating their own spaceship , developing such probes as the eu 's hermes and the russian buran .
but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .
and officials hope it will have fewer technical issues than the nasa shuttles : the columbia crashed due to a technical malfunction two years ago , while the challenger exploded on take-off in 1986 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting more independence in space " the clipper will lead the way for this new cooperation , " manuel valls , a leading esa official who helps plan the agency 's manned space exploration strategy , told the associated press .
" both agencies will work over the next few years to construct a detailed work schedule and figure out the various ways we can collaborate . "
a new type of shuttle the probe , the creation of the russian space corporation rkk energia , would be a reusable plane that would glide back to earth , holding up to six people .

while sending up rockets such as the ariane 5 , it has had to collaborate with the us or russia in order to send astronauts into space because it needs a transport component to its shuttles . developing the clipper would free the europeans from dependency on the us rockets and its space program , which slowed due to the columbia crash and budget cuts , and give them a spacecraft to send humans into space at will .
and even though the europeans have developed a cargo spaceship for the space station , officials say that redesigning this shuttle would cost more than developing a new one . as for unmanned probes , the europeans will send one towards mercury and another on a mapping expedition in 2011 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a passion for space nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .

but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .
and officials hope it will have fewer technical issues than the nasa shuttles : the columbia crashed due to a technical malfunction two years ago , while the challenger exploded on take-off in 1986 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting more independence in space " the clipper will lead the way for this new cooperation , " manuel valls , a leading esa official who helps plan the agency 's manned space exploration strategy , told the associated press .
" both agencies will work over the next few years to construct a detailed work schedule and figure out the various ways we can collaborate . "
a new type of shuttle the probe , the creation of the russian space corporation rkk energia , would be a reusable plane that would glide back to earth , holding up to six people .
officials say it would be used for ferry services to the international space station or for space tourism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clipper 's predecessor , buran the shuttle , which will weigh less and have less cargo capacity than the nasa shuttles , is expected to cost about 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .
the esa plans to make a request of an initial 50 million euros at a meeting with european leaders in december . wanting to compete europe has long been on the sidelines when it comes to space exploration .
while sending up rockets such as the ariane 5 , it has had to collaborate with the us or russia in order to send astronauts into space because it needs a transport component to its shuttles . developing the clipper would free the europeans from dependency on the us rockets and its space program , which slowed due to the columbia crash and budget cuts , and give them a spacecraft to send humans into space at will .
and even though the europeans have developed a cargo spaceship for the space station , officials say that redesigning this shuttle would cost more than developing a new one . as for unmanned probes , the europeans will send one towards mercury and another on a mapping expedition in 2011 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a passion for space nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .

it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.07.2005 automotive wind of change from china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a fresh breeze from china , the jiangling landwind for years , europe has spoken of china 's importance as the future market for almost everything .
now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the landwind 's predecessor , the opel frontera " we know that the landwind is based on the frontera -lrb- an opel model whose production was stopped last year -rrb- . "
magnus geisler , an automobile expert from germany 's largest automobile club adac , told dw-radio .
" it does n't have the latest technology .
other newer vehicles are further ahead in this respect . "
a point that wholesaler bijvelds freely admits .
yet , the 17,000-euro -lrb- $ 20,400 -rrb- sticker price is going to win over a market segment that in the past was restricted to looking with envy at the drivers of bmw , volkswagen or mercedes sport-utility vehicles .
" all different people , including those who just turned 18 and got their drivers license , " he said .
" or people who return a leased car and say they will only drive 20 to 25,000 kilometers per year . "
bildunterschrift : mercedes in shanghai it 's obvious that the first " landwinds " wo n't win any engineering awards .
yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jianling factory in nanchang can " landwind " blow away the competition in europe ?
with its shop floor employees earning monthly wages of some 40 to 50 euros , jiangling is unlikely to be going broke anytime soon .
also , probably the most important component of the car , the engine , is built by mitsubishi .
the diesel motor is from general motors .
geisler admitted that there is a strong demand for inexpensive cars currently , but the success of the " landwind " still remains unanswered . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german know-how for china 's energy sector energy is becoming a scarce resource in china and beijing is looking for alternatives .

the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .

" they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the landwind 's predecessor , the opel frontera " we know that the landwind is based on the frontera -lrb- an opel model whose production was stopped last year -rrb- . "
magnus geisler , an automobile expert from germany 's largest automobile club adac , told dw-radio .
" it does n't have the latest technology .
other newer vehicles are further ahead in this respect . "
a point that wholesaler bijvelds freely admits .
yet , the 17,000-euro -lrb- $ 20,400 -rrb- sticker price is going to win over a market segment that in the past was restricted to looking with envy at the drivers of bmw , volkswagen or mercedes sport-utility vehicles .
" all different people , including those who just turned 18 and got their drivers license , " he said .
" or people who return a leased car and say they will only drive 20 to 25,000 kilometers per year . "

yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .

" they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

" we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "

while there is no specific threat , italy has swung into action to prevent a possible atrocity . while there has been no confirmation of a specific threat or any official statement of unease from the government , the intense activity in various areas of the political arena suggests that italy is considering itself a target high on the international terrorism hit list . the country has been a hive of political activity ever since the still yet uncorroborated claim of responsibility for the london bombings on july 7 by a group calling itself the organization of al qaeda jihad in europe that warned that italy could be next . in the immediate aftermath of the london attacks , italy placed its security forces on alert after the direct threat - which also included a warning to denmark - was issued over its support for the us-led coalition in iraq .

" they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

" they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .

though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for penisplus , a site for surgical penis enlargements .
the ad won an advertising award in 2003 .
others say that average germans are also to blame .
" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .

" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "

selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2005 anti-racism groups slam german ads 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kent nagano conducts wagner " - charming or tasteless ?
racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

many zoos put on special exhibits in order to attract visitors .
most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . "
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's media struggle with migrants even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches .
-lrb- april 20 , 2005 -rrb- un urges germany to rein in neo-nazism a new report submitted to the united nations human rights commission on monday called on the eu and other member states to ban racist political parties and crack down on neo-nazism , especially in eastern germany .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the landwind 's predecessor , the opel frontera " we know that the landwind is based on the frontera -lrb- an opel model whose production was stopped last year -rrb- . "
magnus geisler , an automobile expert from germany 's largest automobile club adac , told dw-radio .
" it does n't have the latest technology .

a point that wholesaler bijvelds freely admits .

yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .

but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

against the backdrop of the delayed discovery shuttle launch , europe and russia and decided to build a space shuttle to crack through the space monopoly held by nasa .
can they successfully take on the us ? for years , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the russians planned on creating their own spaceship , developing such probes as the eu 's hermes and the russian buran .
but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .
and officials hope it will have fewer technical issues than the nasa shuttles : the columbia crashed due to a technical malfunction two years ago , while the challenger exploded on take-off in 1986 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting more independence in space " the clipper will lead the way for this new cooperation , " manuel valls , a leading esa official who helps plan the agency 's manned space exploration strategy , told the associated press .
" both agencies will work over the next few years to construct a detailed work schedule and figure out the various ways we can collaborate . "
a new type of shuttle the probe , the creation of the russian space corporation rkk energia , would be a reusable plane that would glide back to earth , holding up to six people .
officials say it would be used for ferry services to the international space station or for space tourism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clipper 's predecessor , buran the shuttle , which will weigh less and have less cargo capacity than the nasa shuttles , is expected to cost about 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .
the esa plans to make a request of an initial 50 million euros at a meeting with european leaders in december . wanting to compete europe has long been on the sidelines when it comes to space exploration .
while sending up rockets such as the ariane 5 , it has had to collaborate with the us or russia in order to send astronauts into space because it needs a transport component to its shuttles . developing the clipper would free the europeans from dependency on the us rockets and its space program , which slowed due to the columbia crash and budget cuts , and give them a spacecraft to send humans into space at will .
and even though the europeans have developed a cargo spaceship for the space station , officials say that redesigning this shuttle would cost more than developing a new one . as for unmanned probes , the europeans will send one towards mercury and another on a mapping expedition in 2011 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a passion for space nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .

" it does n't have the latest technology .

a point that wholesaler bijvelds freely admits .

yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .

angela merkel , germany 's conservative leader , took a swipe at chancellor gerhard schröder for his position on un security council reform .
merkel is in favor of changes but thinks schröder is acting wrongly . as the debate over potential reforms at the united nations heats up this summer , just how they should come about is still a hot-button issue .
angela merkel , leader of germany 's conservatives and potential successor to chancellor gerhard schröder this autumn , lashed out at the embattled leader .
speaking to foreign reporters on thursday , she said that " reform of the -lrb- security -rrb- council can only be part of a comprehensive reform of the united nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- r . -rrb- would like to mend strained relations with us president george w. bush albeit in favor of the current drive by the center-left government to seek a permanent spot on the security council , merkel remarked that the effort could come at a " high price . "
" there is a danger that the overall reform that must take place is hurt because the discussion is narrowly focused on the makeup of the council , " she said .
" it could leave us short of the goal . "
washington opposes calls for reforms the political wrangling in germany , coming before probable elections in september , will probably be welcomed by the united states which opposes the plan of the so-called g-4 countries - brazil , germany , india and japan .
the g-4 draft resolution proposes enlarging the council to 25 members from its current 15 .
six of those new seats would be permanent and four non-permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security council session : how much room is there at the table ?
yet , the us and china have made clear that they would reject the g-4 proposal .
washington has stated that germany 's calls for reform does not enjoy broad-based support , pointing to two other reform plans - one by african countries and the other by a group calling itself " united for consensus " and comprising pakistan , argentina , canada , italy and mexico .
delay is not the answer the reform effort in the un is of utmost importance to the current german government .
in israel on wednesday , foreign minister joscka fischer made this clear and hit back at the us opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer has " fresh ideas " for the un but some are opposed " i am very familiar with their arguments but ultimately it is a question of whether you want reform or not , " he told reporters .
" and delaying things will only lead to there being no reform . "
he added that only the g-4 proposal takes into account regional balance , " which is an essential point , " he said .
any expansion of the security council would need two-thirds approval from the 191-member general assembly .
eventually , it would be necessary to change the un charter and here , the five permanent members - the united states , china , russia , britain and france - can use their veto power . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany on un diplomatic offensive after rejection by the us of a draft resolution by germany and three other countries for permanent un security council seats , berlin and its allies are going on the offensive to drum up support for their plan .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

merkel is in favor of changes but thinks schröder is acting wrongly . as the debate over potential reforms at the united nations heats up this summer , just how they should come about is still a hot-button issue .
angela merkel , leader of germany 's conservatives and potential successor to chancellor gerhard schröder this autumn , lashed out at the embattled leader .

it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 bomb probe widens to egypt , pakistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators seized explosives during a raid in leeds britain 's probe into last week 's london bombings took on a new twist friday with the arrest of an egyptian chemistry expert in cairo and a " pakistan connection " to the attacks . the 33-year-old us-trained biochemist known as magdy el-nashar , a researcher at leeds university in northern london , was being questioned for his role in last week 's london bombings that killed over 50 people and injured 700 . egyptian sources told afp that el-nashar , " is being interrogated to see whether he is indeed the one everybody is talking about as being involved in the london bombings . " they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

many zoos put on special exhibits in order to attract visitors .
most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . "
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's media struggle with migrants even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches .

" they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

against the backdrop of the delayed discovery shuttle launch , europe and russia and decided to build a space shuttle to crack through the space monopoly held by nasa .
can they successfully take on the us ? for years , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the russians planned on creating their own spaceship , developing such probes as the eu 's hermes and the russian buran .
but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .
and officials hope it will have fewer technical issues than the nasa shuttles : the columbia crashed due to a technical malfunction two years ago , while the challenger exploded on take-off in 1986 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting more independence in space " the clipper will lead the way for this new cooperation , " manuel valls , a leading esa official who helps plan the agency 's manned space exploration strategy , told the associated press .
" both agencies will work over the next few years to construct a detailed work schedule and figure out the various ways we can collaborate . "
a new type of shuttle the probe , the creation of the russian space corporation rkk energia , would be a reusable plane that would glide back to earth , holding up to six people .
officials say it would be used for ferry services to the international space station or for space tourism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clipper 's predecessor , buran the shuttle , which will weigh less and have less cargo capacity than the nasa shuttles , is expected to cost about 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .
the esa plans to make a request of an initial 50 million euros at a meeting with european leaders in december . wanting to compete europe has long been on the sidelines when it comes to space exploration .
while sending up rockets such as the ariane 5 , it has had to collaborate with the us or russia in order to send astronauts into space because it needs a transport component to its shuttles . developing the clipper would free the europeans from dependency on the us rockets and its space program , which slowed due to the columbia crash and budget cuts , and give them a spacecraft to send humans into space at will .
and even though the europeans have developed a cargo spaceship for the space station , officials say that redesigning this shuttle would cost more than developing a new one . as for unmanned probes , the europeans will send one towards mercury and another on a mapping expedition in 2011 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a passion for space nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .

once it starts flying , it will deliver food , water and fuel to the astronauts .

" they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .

selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .

" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .

" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .

selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for penisplus , a site for surgical penis enlargements .
the ad won an advertising award in 2003 .
others say that average germans are also to blame .
" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .

" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 anti-terror efforts increase as italy braces großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the warning from the al qaeda-affiliated group put italy on alert italy appears to be taking a warning from the group which claimed responsibility for the london bomb attacks very seriously .
while there is no specific threat , italy has swung into action to prevent a possible atrocity . while there has been no confirmation of a specific threat or any official statement of unease from the government , the intense activity in various areas of the political arena suggests that italy is considering itself a target high on the international terrorism hit list . the country has been a hive of political activity ever since the still yet uncorroborated claim of responsibility for the london bombings on july 7 by a group calling itself the organization of al qaeda jihad in europe that warned that italy could be next . in the immediate aftermath of the london attacks , italy placed its security forces on alert after the direct threat - which also included a warning to denmark - was issued over its support for the us-led coalition in iraq .
italy maintains a 3,000 strong-force in the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi " we are checking the veracity of these claims and of this threat , " prime minister silvio berlusconi said last week .
but he acknowledged that italy " is in the front line because it is defending freedom and democracy . " " italy is the third biggest contributor to international peace missions and that has brought negative attention from terrorist organizations , " he said . " it 's pointless to hide the fact that targets like trains are difficult to protect and for that reason , we have to strengthen our vigilance and our attention , being conscious that we are exposed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , berlusconi 's government have placed some 13,000 potential targets permanently under guard - up to 6,000 of them in rome - using some 23,000 police and military . extremists at large in italy despite a series of direct threats from shadowy islamic extremist groups , italy has to date remained untouched by the sort of terror attacks which have devastated madrid and london in the wake of the iraq war . one such threat was made in august last year in a statement posted on an islamic web site in the name of the abu hafs al-masri brigades-al-qaeda .
it declared " a bloody war " on italians , specifically targeting berlusconi , a staunch supporter of us president george w. bush . there are an estimated 350 islamic extremists who intelligence sources believe are based in italy in several " sleeper cells " - mainly in the industrialized north and around naples in the south . they said the two groups most active in italy were the salafist group for preaching and combat , which aims to establish an islamic state in algeria , and the moroccan salafist fighting group . support for iraq mission will not change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while italy has escaped terrorist attack at home , it lost 19 of its soldiers in a truck bomb attack on the italian base at nasiriyah , iraq in november 2003 . berlusconi has stubbornly insisted italy will maintain its forces in iraq , and despite the london bombings and yet another direct threat to italy , is unlikely to change his mind .
" terrorism is the cancer which we must n't be frightened to fight .
if we are united and determined to face it , terrorism will not win , " he said last week . huge anti-terror sweep and fight it he appears determined to do .
within days of the london bombings , italian police and ant-terror troops raided scores of homes and detained 174 people across the country in a sweeping crackdown on suspected islamic militants .
raids were carried out in a number of cities across italy but investigations were focused on milan , rome , turin and naples , interior ministry sources said . while assertive action has been taking place on the streets , berlusconi and his government are working to provide a political framework to step-up the battle against extremists in italy . government discusses hard-line measures the government is set to discuss an anti-terror package at a special cabinet meeting on friday to discuss a package of anti-terrorism measures that were presented to parliament earlier this week . the package , which would be subject to parliamentary approval , includes allowing police to detain suspects longer without charges , giving police greater investigative powers and incentives for those helping investigators bring down terrorist cells , and strengthening judicial provisions for terrorism-linked offenses . the state would also move to freeze the assets of businesses suspected of supporting terrorist groups , which would go beyond an asset freeze ordered on criminal organizations set in place after sept .
11 . the government also suggested that anti-terrorism investigators should be allowed to offer residence permits to illegal immigrants in the muslim community in return for regular information about the community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan italian media reports say the proposals include enlarging police powers to allow closer electronic surveillance of the muslim community and creating a dedicated national anti-terrorism agency , modeled on one already in place to fight mafia crimes . however , this much-touted agency has yet to be established some four years after it was first proposed in the wake of sept .
11 .
it is evidence of a significant problem which still remains : the process for implementing policy in italy is notoriously lethargic , a state that must be rectified before it is too late . " the italian state apparatus is still very slow , " italy expert roman mahrun of the munich center for applied policy research told dw-world .
" the security services can not achieve much if they are restrained by politics , " mahrun concluded . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's terror efforts under scrutiny a year after the madrid bombings , international leaders arrive in the city to discuss the on-going war on terror .

angela merkel , germany 's conservative leader , took a swipe at chancellor gerhard schröder for his position on un security council reform .
merkel is in favor of changes but thinks schröder is acting wrongly . as the debate over potential reforms at the united nations heats up this summer , just how they should come about is still a hot-button issue .
angela merkel , leader of germany 's conservatives and potential successor to chancellor gerhard schröder this autumn , lashed out at the embattled leader .
speaking to foreign reporters on thursday , she said that " reform of the -lrb- security -rrb- council can only be part of a comprehensive reform of the united nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- r . -rrb- would like to mend strained relations with us president george w. bush albeit in favor of the current drive by the center-left government to seek a permanent spot on the security council , merkel remarked that the effort could come at a " high price . "
" there is a danger that the overall reform that must take place is hurt because the discussion is narrowly focused on the makeup of the council , " she said .
" it could leave us short of the goal . "
washington opposes calls for reforms the political wrangling in germany , coming before probable elections in september , will probably be welcomed by the united states which opposes the plan of the so-called g-4 countries - brazil , germany , india and japan .
the g-4 draft resolution proposes enlarging the council to 25 members from its current 15 .
six of those new seats would be permanent and four non-permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security council session : how much room is there at the table ?
yet , the us and china have made clear that they would reject the g-4 proposal .
washington has stated that germany 's calls for reform does not enjoy broad-based support , pointing to two other reform plans - one by african countries and the other by a group calling itself " united for consensus " and comprising pakistan , argentina , canada , italy and mexico .
delay is not the answer the reform effort in the un is of utmost importance to the current german government .
in israel on wednesday , foreign minister joscka fischer made this clear and hit back at the us opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer has " fresh ideas " for the un but some are opposed " i am very familiar with their arguments but ultimately it is a question of whether you want reform or not , " he told reporters .
" and delaying things will only lead to there being no reform . "
he added that only the g-4 proposal takes into account regional balance , " which is an essential point , " he said .
any expansion of the security council would need two-thirds approval from the 191-member general assembly .
eventually , it would be necessary to change the un charter and here , the five permanent members - the united states , china , russia , britain and france - can use their veto power . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany on un diplomatic offensive after rejection by the us of a draft resolution by germany and three other countries for permanent un security council seats , berlin and its allies are going on the offensive to drum up support for their plan .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the landwind 's predecessor , the opel frontera " we know that the landwind is based on the frontera -lrb- an opel model whose production was stopped last year -rrb- . "
magnus geisler , an automobile expert from germany 's largest automobile club adac , told dw-radio .
" it does n't have the latest technology .
other newer vehicles are further ahead in this respect . "
a point that wholesaler bijvelds freely admits .
yet , the 17,000-euro -lrb- $ 20,400 -rrb- sticker price is going to win over a market segment that in the past was restricted to looking with envy at the drivers of bmw , volkswagen or mercedes sport-utility vehicles .
" all different people , including those who just turned 18 and got their drivers license , " he said .
" or people who return a leased car and say they will only drive 20 to 25,000 kilometers per year . "
bildunterschrift : mercedes in shanghai it 's obvious that the first " landwinds " wo n't win any engineering awards .
yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jianling factory in nanchang can " landwind " blow away the competition in europe ?
with its shop floor employees earning monthly wages of some 40 to 50 euros , jiangling is unlikely to be going broke anytime soon .
also , probably the most important component of the car , the engine , is built by mitsubishi .
the diesel motor is from general motors .
geisler admitted that there is a strong demand for inexpensive cars currently , but the success of the " landwind " still remains unanswered . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german know-how for china 's energy sector energy is becoming a scarce resource in china and beijing is looking for alternatives .
on friday , germany 's foreign minister inaugurated one of the largest german-chinese joint ventures for solar energy there .

however wholesale deals on old industrial plants are n't out of the ordinary for germany .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .

yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "

" based on our own experience and the lessons we have learned from very different circumstances in our member states , without a sufficient level of political reform , growth may eventually be slowed or disrupted by instability , " he said in a speech at the chinese academy of social sciences . " china 's internal long-term sustainability also depends on its ability to introduce political reform , allowing for more democracy and civil liberties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso , left , president of the european commission , meets with chinese premier wen jiabao at the great hall of the people in beijing on thursday 14 july , 2005 .
barroso is on a four-day visit to china for talks , with trade and political cooperation expected to be high on the agenda .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian bradshaw , pool -rrb- barroso is on his first trip to china and held talks with president hu jintao friday .
despite making clear the 25-member european union was committed to enhancing its strategic relations with the asian giant , problems in the relationship remain , not least its 16-year-old arms embargo . " the eu will base its decision on our own analysis , interest and values .
the problem , frankly , is that the public opinion of our member states are concerned about human rights issues , " he told a press briefing later . the eu slapped the ban on china after the tiananmen crackdown on the pro-democracy movement , and has demanded improvements to human rights before it is removed . cautious note over trade issues on trade issues , barroso said china 's rapidly growing trade surplus with the eu was making it difficult to expand economic ties .

against the backdrop of the delayed discovery shuttle launch , europe and russia and decided to build a space shuttle to crack through the space monopoly held by nasa .
can they successfully take on the us ? for years , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the russians planned on creating their own spaceship , developing such probes as the eu 's hermes and the russian buran .
but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .
and officials hope it will have fewer technical issues than the nasa shuttles : the columbia crashed due to a technical malfunction two years ago , while the challenger exploded on take-off in 1986 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting more independence in space " the clipper will lead the way for this new cooperation , " manuel valls , a leading esa official who helps plan the agency 's manned space exploration strategy , told the associated press .
" both agencies will work over the next few years to construct a detailed work schedule and figure out the various ways we can collaborate . "
a new type of shuttle the probe , the creation of the russian space corporation rkk energia , would be a reusable plane that would glide back to earth , holding up to six people .
officials say it would be used for ferry services to the international space station or for space tourism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clipper 's predecessor , buran the shuttle , which will weigh less and have less cargo capacity than the nasa shuttles , is expected to cost about 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .

" they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .
it is communities who will defeat terrorism .

impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .

" british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for penisplus , a site for surgical penis enlargements .
the ad won an advertising award in 2003 .
others say that average germans are also to blame .
" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .
" but to hear and see the mainstream public sphere in germany , you ’ d think that all germans are white . " sonia phalnikar , dw-world.de back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de colonial cliches in a german zoo ?

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for penisplus , a site for surgical penis enlargements .
the ad won an advertising award in 2003 .
others say that average germans are also to blame .
" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "

" asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .

but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .

" both agencies will work over the next few years to construct a detailed work schedule and figure out the various ways we can collaborate . "

while sending up rockets such as the ariane 5 , it has had to collaborate with the us or russia in order to send astronauts into space because it needs a transport component to its shuttles . developing the clipper would free the europeans from dependency on the us rockets and its space program , which slowed due to the columbia crash and budget cuts , and give them a spacecraft to send humans into space at will .
and even though the europeans have developed a cargo spaceship for the space station , officials say that redesigning this shuttle would cost more than developing a new one . as for unmanned probes , the europeans will send one towards mercury and another on a mapping expedition in 2011 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a passion for space nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

against the backdrop of the delayed discovery shuttle launch , europe and russia and decided to build a space shuttle to crack through the space monopoly held by nasa .
can they successfully take on the us ? for years , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the russians planned on creating their own spaceship , developing such probes as the eu 's hermes and the russian buran .
but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .
and officials hope it will have fewer technical issues than the nasa shuttles : the columbia crashed due to a technical malfunction two years ago , while the challenger exploded on take-off in 1986 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting more independence in space " the clipper will lead the way for this new cooperation , " manuel valls , a leading esa official who helps plan the agency 's manned space exploration strategy , told the associated press .
" both agencies will work over the next few years to construct a detailed work schedule and figure out the various ways we can collaborate . "
a new type of shuttle the probe , the creation of the russian space corporation rkk energia , would be a reusable plane that would glide back to earth , holding up to six people .
officials say it would be used for ferry services to the international space station or for space tourism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clipper 's predecessor , buran the shuttle , which will weigh less and have less cargo capacity than the nasa shuttles , is expected to cost about 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .
the esa plans to make a request of an initial 50 million euros at a meeting with european leaders in december . wanting to compete europe has long been on the sidelines when it comes to space exploration .
while sending up rockets such as the ariane 5 , it has had to collaborate with the us or russia in order to send astronauts into space because it needs a transport component to its shuttles . developing the clipper would free the europeans from dependency on the us rockets and its space program , which slowed due to the columbia crash and budget cuts , and give them a spacecraft to send humans into space at will .
and even though the europeans have developed a cargo spaceship for the space station , officials say that redesigning this shuttle would cost more than developing a new one . as for unmanned probes , the europeans will send one towards mercury and another on a mapping expedition in 2011 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a passion for space nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

earlier this week , deutsche börse 's interim chief mathias llubek had ruled out a straightforward withdrawal from the us futures market , but conceded that " a number of different options " were being looked at to reposition the group 's activities in the us .
die welt reported friday that among the different options was one where the german group would have only a represenative office in chicago , while futures trading would actually be done in frankfurt . dw-world.de deutsche börse wants closer ties to swiss following its failed attempt to take over the london stock exchange , german stock market operator deutsche börse is looking to strengthen its ties with the swiss stock exchange swx in zurich .

it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "

the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2005 anti-racism groups slam german ads 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kent nagano conducts wagner " - charming or tasteless ?
racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

many zoos put on special exhibits in order to attract visitors .
most also attract little notice much less controversy .
but one zoo in southern germany is causing an uproar with a new event , an " african village . "
-lrb- june 9 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's media struggle with migrants even though some 7.3 million foreigners currently live in germany , migrant life still gets a bad rap in the media .
public broadcasters met in berlin recently to discuss ways of combating the cliches .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .
" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .
-lrb- july 14 , 2005 -rrb- eu to improve anti-terror measures the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?

yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .

angela merkel , germany 's conservative leader , took a swipe at chancellor gerhard schröder for his position on un security council reform .
merkel is in favor of changes but thinks schröder is acting wrongly . as the debate over potential reforms at the united nations heats up this summer , just how they should come about is still a hot-button issue .
angela merkel , leader of germany 's conservatives and potential successor to chancellor gerhard schröder this autumn , lashed out at the embattled leader .
speaking to foreign reporters on thursday , she said that " reform of the -lrb- security -rrb- council can only be part of a comprehensive reform of the united nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- r . -rrb- would like to mend strained relations with us president george w. bush albeit in favor of the current drive by the center-left government to seek a permanent spot on the security council , merkel remarked that the effort could come at a " high price . "
" there is a danger that the overall reform that must take place is hurt because the discussion is narrowly focused on the makeup of the council , " she said .
" it could leave us short of the goal . "
washington opposes calls for reforms the political wrangling in germany , coming before probable elections in september , will probably be welcomed by the united states which opposes the plan of the so-called g-4 countries - brazil , germany , india and japan .
the g-4 draft resolution proposes enlarging the council to 25 members from its current 15 .
six of those new seats would be permanent and four non-permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security council session : how much room is there at the table ?
yet , the us and china have made clear that they would reject the g-4 proposal .
washington has stated that germany 's calls for reform does not enjoy broad-based support , pointing to two other reform plans - one by african countries and the other by a group calling itself " united for consensus " and comprising pakistan , argentina , canada , italy and mexico .
delay is not the answer the reform effort in the un is of utmost importance to the current german government .
in israel on wednesday , foreign minister joscka fischer made this clear and hit back at the us opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer has " fresh ideas " for the un but some are opposed " i am very familiar with their arguments but ultimately it is a question of whether you want reform or not , " he told reporters .
" and delaying things will only lead to there being no reform . "
he added that only the g-4 proposal takes into account regional balance , " which is an essential point , " he said .
any expansion of the security council would need two-thirds approval from the 191-member general assembly .
eventually , it would be necessary to change the un charter and here , the five permanent members - the united states , china , russia , britain and france - can use their veto power . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany on un diplomatic offensive after rejection by the us of a draft resolution by germany and three other countries for permanent un security council seats , berlin and its allies are going on the offensive to drum up support for their plan .
-lrb- july 14 , 2005 -rrb- un reform sparks heavy debate tensions ran high during the first day of debates at the united nations on security council enlargement .
diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .

it said that extradition could only be stopped when the suspect faced " cruel , degrading or unbearable punishment " in a foreign country .
azarg , 36 , is suspected of storming , together with three other armed men , a party with 17 people in marin city in northern california on january 9 , 1997 and killing the host with seven gunshots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .
-lrb- july 14 , 2005 -rrb- eu to improve anti-terror measures the european commission said it will speed up efforts to create an eu-wide intelligence network and improve its emergency plans in the wake of thursday 's bombing attacks on london 's transport system .

" they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .

" one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .

" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .

" based on our own experience and the lessons we have learned from very different circumstances in our member states , without a sufficient level of political reform , growth may eventually be slowed or disrupted by instability , " he said in a speech at the chinese academy of social sciences . " china 's internal long-term sustainability also depends on its ability to introduce political reform , allowing for more democracy and civil liberties . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jose manuel barroso , left , president of the european commission , meets with chinese premier wen jiabao at the great hall of the people in beijing on thursday 14 july , 2005 .
barroso is on a four-day visit to china for talks , with trade and political cooperation expected to be high on the agenda .
-lrb- ap photo / adrian bradshaw , pool -rrb- barroso is on his first trip to china and held talks with president hu jintao friday .
despite making clear the 25-member european union was committed to enhancing its strategic relations with the asian giant , problems in the relationship remain , not least its 16-year-old arms embargo . " the eu will base its decision on our own analysis , interest and values .
the problem , frankly , is that the public opinion of our member states are concerned about human rights issues , " he told a press briefing later . the eu slapped the ban on china after the tiananmen crackdown on the pro-democracy movement , and has demanded improvements to human rights before it is removed . cautious note over trade issues on trade issues , barroso said china 's rapidly growing trade surplus with the eu was making it difficult to expand economic ties . " as you know , unemployment in parts of the eu is quite high and our citizens are increasingly worried about job losses that are perceived to be caused by outsourcing , " he said .
" the rapidly growing bilateral trade surplus in china 's favor -lrb- 78 billion euros or $ 95 billion -rrb- makes these perceptions more difficult to manage . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : factory workers in china make shoes on the production line the two trading partners only narrowly averted the imposition of sanctions over textile imports from china , resolving the issue recently through last-minute political intervention .
however , eu anti-dumping probes on other imports from china such as shoes remain an irritant . barroso nevertheless struck an optimistic note by saying trade rows among market players were normal and that the eu wants to expand its cooperation with china beyond trade in fields such as environment , health and anti-terrorism . " so far , this problem has been really minimal compared with the huge dimension of our trade and investment relations , " he said . this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of relations between china and the eu -lrb- then the european economic community -rrb- , and barroso expressed hope for the renewal of a framework agreement that dates back to 1985 .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "

selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .

ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .

" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "

selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .

" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .

" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " das neue ladio - sehl gutel musiksendl " - radio channel youfm for youngsters falls back on the alleged asian speech quirk -lrb- r -rrb- again in its advertisement for " the new radio - very good music program " such stereotypes are frequently played upon in german ads . " asians are usually depicted as small , giggly people who ca n't pronounce the letter " r " and constantly take photographs , while blacks are shown either as victims in need of donations or as hip djs , " so said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i see black - i see white , " an advertisement for the gez central fees office for public broadcasting in germany .
in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for penisplus , a site for surgical penis enlargements .
the ad won an advertising award in 2003 .
others say that average germans are also to blame .
" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .

" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .

speaking to foreign reporters on thursday , she said that " reform of the -lrb- security -rrb- council can only be part of a comprehensive reform of the united nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- r . -rrb- would like to mend strained relations with us president george w. bush albeit in favor of the current drive by the center-left government to seek a permanent spot on the security council , merkel remarked that the effort could come at a " high price . "
" there is a danger that the overall reform that must take place is hurt because the discussion is narrowly focused on the makeup of the council , " she said .
" it could leave us short of the goal . "
washington opposes calls for reforms the political wrangling in germany , coming before probable elections in september , will probably be welcomed by the united states which opposes the plan of the so-called g-4 countries - brazil , germany , india and japan .
the g-4 draft resolution proposes enlarging the council to 25 members from its current 15 .
six of those new seats would be permanent and four non-permanent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security council session : how much room is there at the table ?
yet , the us and china have made clear that they would reject the g-4 proposal .
washington has stated that germany 's calls for reform does not enjoy broad-based support , pointing to two other reform plans - one by african countries and the other by a group calling itself " united for consensus " and comprising pakistan , argentina , canada , italy and mexico .
delay is not the answer the reform effort in the un is of utmost importance to the current german government .
in israel on wednesday , foreign minister joscka fischer made this clear and hit back at the us opposition .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer has " fresh ideas " for the un but some are opposed " i am very familiar with their arguments but ultimately it is a question of whether you want reform or not , " he told reporters .
" and delaying things will only lead to there being no reform . "
he added that only the g-4 proposal takes into account regional balance , " which is an essential point , " he said .
any expansion of the security council would need two-thirds approval from the 191-member general assembly .
eventually , it would be necessary to change the un charter and here , the five permanent members - the united states , china , russia , britain and france - can use their veto power . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany on un diplomatic offensive after rejection by the us of a draft resolution by germany and three other countries for permanent un security council seats , berlin and its allies are going on the offensive to drum up support for their plan .
-lrb- july 14 , 2005 -rrb- un reform sparks heavy debate tensions ran high during the first day of debates at the united nations on security council enlargement .
diplomatic niceties are expected to remain scarce as talks resume tuesday .
-lrb- july 12 , 2005 -rrb- competing plans threaten un reform germany , brazil , india and japan have submitted a draft resolution on a proposed expansion of the un security council and want an early vote in the general assembly .
but rival plans are complicating matters .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the landwind 's predecessor , the opel frontera " we know that the landwind is based on the frontera -lrb- an opel model whose production was stopped last year -rrb- . "
magnus geisler , an automobile expert from germany 's largest automobile club adac , told dw-radio .
" it does n't have the latest technology .

a point that wholesaler bijvelds freely admits .

" or people who return a leased car and say they will only drive 20 to 25,000 kilometers per year . "
bildunterschrift : mercedes in shanghai it 's obvious that the first " landwinds " wo n't win any engineering awards .
yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jianling factory in nanchang can " landwind " blow away the competition in europe ?
with its shop floor employees earning monthly wages of some 40 to 50 euros , jiangling is unlikely to be going broke anytime soon .
also , probably the most important component of the car , the engine , is built by mitsubishi .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the landwind 's predecessor , the opel frontera " we know that the landwind is based on the frontera -lrb- an opel model whose production was stopped last year -rrb- . "
magnus geisler , an automobile expert from germany 's largest automobile club adac , told dw-radio .
" it does n't have the latest technology .
other newer vehicles are further ahead in this respect . "
a point that wholesaler bijvelds freely admits .
yet , the 17,000-euro -lrb- $ 20,400 -rrb- sticker price is going to win over a market segment that in the past was restricted to looking with envy at the drivers of bmw , volkswagen or mercedes sport-utility vehicles .
" all different people , including those who just turned 18 and got their drivers license , " he said .
" or people who return a leased car and say they will only drive 20 to 25,000 kilometers per year . "
bildunterschrift : mercedes in shanghai it 's obvious that the first " landwinds " wo n't win any engineering awards .
yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jianling factory in nanchang can " landwind " blow away the competition in europe ?
with its shop floor employees earning monthly wages of some 40 to 50 euros , jiangling is unlikely to be going broke anytime soon .
also , probably the most important component of the car , the engine , is built by mitsubishi .
the diesel motor is from general motors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "

" so far , this problem has been really minimal compared with the huge dimension of our trade and investment relations , " he said . this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of relations between china and the eu -lrb- then the european economic community -rrb- , and barroso expressed hope for the renewal of a framework agreement that dates back to 1985 .

against the backdrop of the delayed discovery shuttle launch , europe and russia and decided to build a space shuttle to crack through the space monopoly held by nasa .
can they successfully take on the us ? for years , the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- and the russians planned on creating their own spaceship , developing such probes as the eu 's hermes and the russian buran .
but they never threatened the top place of the american space shuttles . now , esa and its russian counterpart have come up with a plan for a new manned shuttle , the clipper , which should make its maiden voyage by 2012 .
and officials hope it will have fewer technical issues than the nasa shuttles : the columbia crashed due to a technical malfunction two years ago , while the challenger exploded on take-off in 1986 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wanting more independence in space " the clipper will lead the way for this new cooperation , " manuel valls , a leading esa official who helps plan the agency 's manned space exploration strategy , told the associated press .
" both agencies will work over the next few years to construct a detailed work schedule and figure out the various ways we can collaborate . "
a new type of shuttle the probe , the creation of the russian space corporation rkk energia , would be a reusable plane that would glide back to earth , holding up to six people .
officials say it would be used for ferry services to the international space station or for space tourism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : clipper 's predecessor , buran the shuttle , which will weigh less and have less cargo capacity than the nasa shuttles , is expected to cost about 1.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .
the esa plans to make a request of an initial 50 million euros at a meeting with european leaders in december . wanting to compete europe has long been on the sidelines when it comes to space exploration .
while sending up rockets such as the ariane 5 , it has had to collaborate with the us or russia in order to send astronauts into space because it needs a transport component to its shuttles . developing the clipper would free the europeans from dependency on the us rockets and its space program , which slowed due to the columbia crash and budget cuts , and give them a spacecraft to send humans into space at will .
and even though the europeans have developed a cargo spaceship for the space station , officials say that redesigning this shuttle would cost more than developing a new one . as for unmanned probes , the europeans will send one towards mercury and another on a mapping expedition in 2011 . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a passion for space nasa has delayed the launch of its first space shuttle mission since the 2003 columbia disaster because of a technical problem .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.07.2005 anti-racism groups slam german ads 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " kent nagano conducts wagner " - charming or tasteless ?
racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noah so noah so , a prominent black german radio presenter and singer -lrb- photo -rrb- , who founded the group " der braune mob , " which monitors race issues in the media and advertising , said most germans think it 's perfectly normal to make fun of certain racial minorities .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .
but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .

racism in germany is usually associated with far-right groups and neo-nazis .

it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .

but anti-racism campaigners say the country 's advertising industry is also guilty of rampant insensitivity towards ethnic minorities . plans to stage an african cultural festival in a zoo in the southern german town of augsburg last month sparked condemnation among the country 's anti-racism groups .
the incident was given wide coverage in germany ’ s mainstream media .
but apart from such one-off controversial events , what hardly receives any attention , according to campaigners , is long-running insensitivity towards ethnic minorities in the country ’ s advertising industry .
a case in point is a poster -lrb- photo , above -rrb- created for the festspielhaus baden-baden last year to advertise german composer richard wagner ’ s " parsifal " performed by acclaimed us conductor kent nagano , currently creative head of the german symphony orchestra in berlin .
it showed a famous portrait of wagner , given a pair of arms with the help of a computer , making slanted eyes in an obvious reference to nagano ’ s japanese origins .
the poster , " kent nagano conducts wagner , " did n't even raise an eyebrow in mainstream germany .
but it did catch the attention of advertising industry insiders - they awarded it a top prize in berlin earlier this year .
" i think it 's tasteless and racist , " said dagmar yu-dembski , chairwoman of the german-chinese friendship society in berlin , who documents examples of racial stereotypes in the media and advertising .
" highlighting the physical features of asians in this way is just a cheap ploy to grab attention .
the crass reference to nagano 's ethnicity has nothing to do with a classical music concert . "
aki takase , a well-known japanese pianist and composer based in berlin agreed . " it is shameful that his origins seem to be so much more important in this case than his immense musical talent , " takase said .
kent nagano was unavailable for a comment .
ethnic cliches insensitivity to issues of ethnicity is widespread in german advertising , according to campaigners .

" in commercials or advertising posters , asians and blacks are usually used to either give germans something to laugh about or they ’ re reduced to ethnic clichés , " so said .
she referred to a current commercial on mtv germany for an online music download platform , in which an asian teenager never manages to buy music by his favorite band , as he can ’ t utter the letter " r " and keeps saying " lamones " instead of " ramones . "

in german , doing something " black " means doing it illegally .
norbert finzsch , a history professor at the university of cologne , agreed .
" the way africans and african americans in germany are perceived and discussed , the way they are presented on billboards and in tv ads proves that the colonialist and racist gaze is still very much alive in germany , " he said in an open letter last month calling for the african cultural festival in the augsburg zoo not to open .
selective political correctness ?
the allegations might seem surprising given that germany is known to be particularly careful about relations with its 6.8 million-strong immigrant population , in view of its past . but anti-racism campaigners suggest that many germans have a selective concept of political correctness - an attitude which is perpetuated by advertising , they say .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " there are many decision-makers - but ours rely on technology and multimedia . "
" naturally , you wo n't find any racist or offensive portrayals of jews or sinti and roma people in german advertising , because most germans are acutely aware that that 's off-limits , " so said .
yu-dembski added that given germany 's large turkish population of some 1.9 million , the stereotyping of muslims in commercials is also taboo .
" the asian community , in comparison , is small and almost invisible .
there 's almost this unspoken agreement that the asians are the laughing stock in german advertising , " she said .

michael preiswerk , company board spokesman for the art directors club -lrb- adc -rrb- , a berlin-based advertising group that awarded the gold prize to the wagner poster earlier this year , defended the move .
" it 's an excellent poster that goes beyond cultures to form a great work and that very strikingly and succinctly shows asian culture . "
he denied it was meant to cause offense .
" it 's charming and funny and shows openness and multiculturalism , " preiswerk said .
he admitted , however , when asked , that had nagano been a black american , it would have been " more complicated " to come up with a creative concept .
volker nickel , press spokesman of the deutscher werberat , an advertising watchdog , also saw the wagner poster as acceptable .
" people who feel directly affected naturally feel upset about such things , but you have to see the advertisement in its entirety , " he said .
though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .
" it really is a fringe phenomenon , " he said .
german reality not just white anti-racism groups are n't convinced .
there 's agreement that lack of awareness is a big part of the problem - a sign that the country still needs to make huge strides to become truly multicultural .
a further stumbling block is presented by the fact that unlike in the uk and us - which admittedly also have their own share of racism - there 's no central body or forum in germany where members of racial minorities can turn when they have a complaint .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an advertisement for penisplus , a site for surgical penis enlargements .
the ad won an advertising award in 2003 .
others say that average germans are also to blame .
" in germany , it 's very important for people not to seem racist .
but they 're more worried about how the british press is referring to them and about nazi comparisons abroad than about how racial minorities are portrayed in their own country , " so said .
she added that , since white people are rarely the target of racial stereotyping , it 's almost impossible for white germans to understand how people of color feel when their ethnicity is ridiculed or portrayed disrespectfully . " german reality isn ’ t only white , " so said , pointing out that there are some 300,000 black germans living in germany today .

though the watchdog has drawn up a list of fundamental rules against discrimination of people in advertising on the basis of ethnicity , race , language and origins among others , it has rarely asked a company to drop an advertisement on those grounds .
nickel underlined that there had not been any " racist advertisements " in germany over the 33 years of the industry watchdog 's existence , only " questionable " ones and that the country enjoyed high advertising standards .
" there 's a great deal of sensitivity in german society and even among companies and people towards other ethnicities - we really do n't need to worry about that , " he said .
he added that the werberat received only between one and three cases a year amid some 400-600 complaints about " racist " ads .

while there is no specific threat , italy has swung into action to prevent a possible atrocity . while there has been no confirmation of a specific threat or any official statement of unease from the government , the intense activity in various areas of the political arena suggests that italy is considering itself a target high on the international terrorism hit list . the country has been a hive of political activity ever since the still yet uncorroborated claim of responsibility for the london bombings on july 7 by a group calling itself the organization of al qaeda jihad in europe that warned that italy could be next . in the immediate aftermath of the london attacks , italy placed its security forces on alert after the direct threat - which also included a warning to denmark - was issued over its support for the us-led coalition in iraq .
italy maintains a 3,000 strong-force in the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi " we are checking the veracity of these claims and of this threat , " prime minister silvio berlusconi said last week .
but he acknowledged that italy " is in the front line because it is defending freedom and democracy . " " italy is the third biggest contributor to international peace missions and that has brought negative attention from terrorist organizations , " he said . " it 's pointless to hide the fact that targets like trains are difficult to protect and for that reason , we have to strengthen our vigilance and our attention , being conscious that we are exposed . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan since the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks on the united states , berlusconi 's government have placed some 13,000 potential targets permanently under guard - up to 6,000 of them in rome - using some 23,000 police and military . extremists at large in italy despite a series of direct threats from shadowy islamic extremist groups , italy has to date remained untouched by the sort of terror attacks which have devastated madrid and london in the wake of the iraq war . one such threat was made in august last year in a statement posted on an islamic web site in the name of the abu hafs al-masri brigades-al-qaeda .
it declared " a bloody war " on italians , specifically targeting berlusconi , a staunch supporter of us president george w. bush . there are an estimated 350 islamic extremists who intelligence sources believe are based in italy in several " sleeper cells " - mainly in the industrialized north and around naples in the south . they said the two groups most active in italy were the salafist group for preaching and combat , which aims to establish an islamic state in algeria , and the moroccan salafist fighting group . support for iraq mission will not change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while italy has escaped terrorist attack at home , it lost 19 of its soldiers in a truck bomb attack on the italian base at nasiriyah , iraq in november 2003 . berlusconi has stubbornly insisted italy will maintain its forces in iraq , and despite the london bombings and yet another direct threat to italy , is unlikely to change his mind .
" terrorism is the cancer which we must n't be frightened to fight .
if we are united and determined to face it , terrorism will not win , " he said last week . huge anti-terror sweep and fight it he appears determined to do .
within days of the london bombings , italian police and ant-terror troops raided scores of homes and detained 174 people across the country in a sweeping crackdown on suspected islamic militants .
raids were carried out in a number of cities across italy but investigations were focused on milan , rome , turin and naples , interior ministry sources said . while assertive action has been taking place on the streets , berlusconi and his government are working to provide a political framework to step-up the battle against extremists in italy . government discusses hard-line measures the government is set to discuss an anti-terror package at a special cabinet meeting on friday to discuss a package of anti-terrorism measures that were presented to parliament earlier this week . the package , which would be subject to parliamentary approval , includes allowing police to detain suspects longer without charges , giving police greater investigative powers and incentives for those helping investigators bring down terrorist cells , and strengthening judicial provisions for terrorism-linked offenses . the state would also move to freeze the assets of businesses suspected of supporting terrorist groups , which would go beyond an asset freeze ordered on criminal organizations set in place after sept .
11 . the government also suggested that anti-terrorism investigators should be allowed to offer residence permits to illegal immigrants in the muslim community in return for regular information about the community . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers patrol at the entrance of the central railway station in milan italian media reports say the proposals include enlarging police powers to allow closer electronic surveillance of the muslim community and creating a dedicated national anti-terrorism agency , modeled on one already in place to fight mafia crimes . however , this much-touted agency has yet to be established some four years after it was first proposed in the wake of sept .
11 .
it is evidence of a significant problem which still remains : the process for implementing policy in italy is notoriously lethargic , a state that must be rectified before it is too late . " the italian state apparatus is still very slow , " italy expert roman mahrun of the munich center for applied policy research told dw-world .

angela merkel , germany 's conservative leader , took a swipe at chancellor gerhard schröder for his position on un security council reform .
merkel is in favor of changes but thinks schröder is acting wrongly . as the debate over potential reforms at the united nations heats up this summer , just how they should come about is still a hot-button issue .
angela merkel , leader of germany 's conservatives and potential successor to chancellor gerhard schröder this autumn , lashed out at the embattled leader .
speaking to foreign reporters on thursday , she said that " reform of the -lrb- security -rrb- council can only be part of a comprehensive reform of the united nations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- r . -rrb- would like to mend strained relations with us president george w. bush albeit in favor of the current drive by the center-left government to seek a permanent spot on the security council , merkel remarked that the effort could come at a " high price . "
" there is a danger that the overall reform that must take place is hurt because the discussion is narrowly focused on the makeup of the council , " she said .
" it could leave us short of the goal . "
washington opposes calls for reforms the political wrangling in germany , coming before probable elections in september , will probably be welcomed by the united states which opposes the plan of the so-called g-4 countries - brazil , germany , india and japan .

washington has stated that germany 's calls for reform does not enjoy broad-based support , pointing to two other reform plans - one by african countries and the other by a group calling itself " united for consensus " and comprising pakistan , argentina , canada , italy and mexico .
delay is not the answer the reform effort in the un is of utmost importance to the current german government .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the landwind 's predecessor , the opel frontera " we know that the landwind is based on the frontera -lrb- an opel model whose production was stopped last year -rrb- . "
magnus geisler , an automobile expert from germany 's largest automobile club adac , told dw-radio .
" it does n't have the latest technology .

a point that wholesaler bijvelds freely admits .

" all different people , including those who just turned 18 and got their drivers license , " he said .
" or people who return a leased car and say they will only drive 20 to 25,000 kilometers per year . "
bildunterschrift : mercedes in shanghai it 's obvious that the first " landwinds " wo n't win any engineering awards .
yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .
they were very attentive , in fact and now germany 's automakers , for example , must watch how this technology transfer will be used against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jianling factory in nanchang can " landwind " blow away the competition in europe ?
with its shop floor employees earning monthly wages of some 40 to 50 euros , jiangling is unlikely to be going broke anytime soon .

now , china has entered the european automobile market with the " landwind . "
is it a threat to europe 's carmakers ? the first 200 models of the chinese " landwind " have arrived in europe .
before they even hit port in antwerp , belgium , the 200 cars were sold .
the sophisticated european car buyer may scoff at the lack of attention to details on the five-door suv , but one point will certainly attract many consumers - the price tag .
it 's some 30 to 40 percent cheaper than its competitors , said peter bijvelds , the sole wholesaler of the " landwind . "
the 27-year-old car auto importer has taken a big chance on the model .
bijvelds has signed a contract for the exclusive rights to the car in 27 countries with the manufacturer of the " landwind , " jiangling .
his goal this year alone is to sell 2,000 of chinese car .
something that does n't seem far-fetched .
will the chinese car hit it big in europe ?
the reactions from the german motoring community are slowly trickling in .

yet , it may only be a question of when the chinese will equal the standards of european car manufacturers - just like the japanese in the 1970s or the south koreans in the past decade .
globalization at its best german carmakers were quick to enter the chinese market and succumb to the demands of beijing to produce their cars in the far eastern giant .
and china naturally did n't idly stand by as foreign manufacturers from almost every industry fought for the large piece of pie in its own country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 opinion : living with growing suspicion großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british muslims are seen as guilty by association in the culture of fear following the london bombings , britain 's muslim minority has found itself subject to a mood of growing suspicion and mistrust .
it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .
and in munich a kurd is being tried for recruiting volunteers for the islamist terror organization ansar al islam .
perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .
in the confused thinking of these people there is only one way of categorizing the world : " us here " and " them there . "
and such people find it all too easy to blame " them there " - the non-muslim majority - for every slight discrimination they suffer in daily life , and to interpret such discrimination as the ideological or religious oppression of islam by " christian western civilization . "
and when this feeling is linked up with international crises and conflicts from palestine to afghanistan , from baghdad to srebrenica , an explosive mixture results .
europeans guilty of mistakes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this may be an explanation , but it is not a justification .
the london killers are criminals , as were the madrid killers or the murderer of theo van gogh .
but europeans - germans among them - should not fall back on a hysterical reaction to an assumed threat from " islam . "
they should rather exercise a little introspection and ask themselves where they might have made mistakes .
and mistakes have been made , not just through lax controls at the borders , but also though inconsiderate treatment of the increasingly large , but originally neglected muslim minorities in our countries .
one such mistake has been the lack of consideration which has been given to the issue of how important religion and religious tradition are for muslims .
it was always much easier to say , " let them integrate if they want to live here . "
and that meant that religious practice was forced into back rooms , where dubious koran schools provided a dangerous religious education .
cultural failures lead to underground instruction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the alleged murderer of theo van gogh is the product of such a school .
elsewhere in europe , similar radicals could currently be undergoing a similar education and training , with religious indoctrination and social isolation and discrimination possibly leading them to terrorism .
it will never be possible to prevent such radicalization completely , but the risk can be reduced if every minority , including muslims , has the feeling that it " belongs . "
that helps the minority , but it also helps society as a whole . peter philipp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu pledges to adopt security laws eu ministers vowed to unite in the fight against terrorism and committed themselves wednesday , days after the london bombings , to implementing security laws agreed on a year ago after the madrid attacks .

it seems it makes little difference whether they have contact to radical islamists or not . many british citizens would no doubt feel easier if those responsible for the attacks had sneaked their way through airport controls at heathrow as they arrived in britain from abroad .
but they have to live with the shocking news : the alleged terrorists were british citizens , members of britain 's muslim minority .
this fact will open the way for speculation and suspicion of all kinds .
but one question will remain at the forefront : are the muslims in britain a " fifth column " ?
that question and the fateful consequences which may well be drawn from it will not be restricted to britain .
france has its large north african muslim community , germany has its turks and even in smaller countries the situation is not very different .
right now , in the netherlands , a young man of moroccan origin , but with dutch citizenship , is on trial for the murder of the film-maker theo van gogh .

perpertrators bring all muslims under suspicion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : such cases arouse concern , but they should not be seen as typical and they should not define the picture which we have of the muslim minority in our countries .
just as the london bombers were prepared to kill muslims together with their other victims , it is also clear that terrorists and those who are prepared to use violence make up a minute proportion of muslims , and that they do not care if they cause all muslims to come under suspicion .
indeed , this could well be one of their aims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.07.2005 bomb probe widens to egypt , pakistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators seized explosives during a raid in leeds britain 's probe into last week 's london bombings took on a new twist friday with the arrest of an egyptian chemistry expert in cairo and a " pakistan connection " to the attacks . the 33-year-old us-trained biochemist known as magdy el-nashar , a researcher at leeds university in northern london , was being questioned for his role in last week 's london bombings that killed over 50 people and injured 700 . egyptian sources told afp that el-nashar , " is being interrogated to see whether he is indeed the one everybody is talking about as being involved in the london bombings . " they said el-nashar was arrested in cairo 's southern suburb of maadi , in the popular neighborhood of bassatin . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debris lies on the street following the bus bomb near tavistock square in london el-nashar is believed to have left london for a 45-day holiday in egypt before the bombings and had intended to return there , egypt 's interior ministry said in a statement .
he has denied any knowledge of the attacks , in which four bombers blew themselves up in three underground trains and a double-decker bus . british police said friday they were " aware " of an arrest in egypt in connection with the investigation into last week 's london bombings . " we are aware of an arrest made in cairo but are not prepared to discuss if we may or may not wish to interview -lrb- the person -rrb- in connection with this investigation , " a spokeswoman for london 's metropolitan police told afp .
" this remains a fast-moving investigation with a number of lines of enquiry , some of which may have an international dimension . " british agents are believed to be with egyptian authorities questioning el-nashar in cairo . el-nashar the alleged bombmaker ? the us network abc news reported the arrest earlier friday , saying el-nashar was the alleged bomb-maker behind the london attacks . citing sources including the us federal bureau of investigation , abc said the detained man was suspected of having helped set up the attackers ' bomb factory . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police officers stand outside the iqra learning centre , a muslim bookshop in beeston , leeds , england the bbc said on its web site that british police searching homes in leeds and buckinghamshire had found ingredients available from high-street chemists in one of the homes .
they were the same kind of explosive richard reid had in his shoes when he tried to blow up a trans-atlantic flight in 2001 . an acquaintance of el-nashar told reuters he was shocked he might be involved in the bombings . " he had a great personality .
you would never expect this kind of action from him .
impossible , " said kadhem al-rawi , a doctor in islamic principles from an institute in wales . " a pakistan connection " sir ian blair , commissioner of london 's metropolitan police , also confirmed on bbc radio friday that there was " a pakistan connection " to the bombings . british police are reported to have given pakistan a list of terror suspects with possible links to the london attacks .
pakistani security agencies are investigating possible links between militant groups based in pakistan and shehzad tanweer , who blew himself up in a train near aldgate underground station in london . tanweer had links to local militant groups , understood to be jaish-e-mohammed and lashkar-e-taiba , both involved in fighting indian forces in kashmir .
the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .
it is communities who will defeat terrorism .

the two groups are known to have ties with osama bin laden 's al qaeda network . jaish is loosely linked with the jamia manzoorul islamia school in the eastern city of lahore , which denied british press reports that tanweer had studied there . lashkar-e-taiba also denied that tanweer visited a campus formerly linked to the group in muridke , near lahore . pakistan 's education minister , javed ashraf , told bbc television that " to the best of our knowledge " there was no military training at the country 's network of some 10,000 madrassas , where up to 1.5 million students are educated .
" if the british government tells us which madrassas we will certainly look to take action , " he said . separately , pakistani investigators said friday they were questioning a british man arrested on suspicion of ties to terror groups , but that he has no known links to the london attacks . zeeshan siddique , 25 , was arrested on may 18 near the northwestern city of peshawar after sneaking into pakistan on fake documents , and is being held at the city 's central jail , the officials told afp . " communities will defeat terrorism " britain has been rattled by the fact that the masterminds of last week 's carnage were apparently carried out by four islamic extremist suicide bombers born and bred in britain .
three of the four suspected bombers were muslim britons of pakistani origin , while the fourth has been named by newspapers as a jamaican immigrant who converted to islam . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a muslim man takes a moment to reflect on last thursday 's bomb attacks at a flower tribute near edgware road tube station , london with the spotlight now on the country 's muslim community , london police chief sir ian blair said friday that britain 's muslim communities must begin an " active engagement in counter-terrorism " following last week 's london suicide bombings . " one of the big messages that i am going to be giving is that we must seize this moment , " blair , said during a speech at a mosque in east london . " this weekend , next week , we have to seize a moment in which the muslim communities of britain , helped by everybody of good will , changes from a current position of shock and disbelief into active engagement in counter-terrorism .
that 's the challenge , " he said . the bombings were " a perversion of the virtues of islam " , said the police chief , who was spending friday visiting mosques and other religious buildings around london . " but , it is done ... by these people who perverted in the name of islam .
and that puts a responsibility on all of us , " he said . " for you ... this is the worst nightmare that can happen to the british muslim community , " blair noted , adding that he had one " simple message " for all the british public . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sir ian blair visits the sikh community at gurdwara dasmesh darbar , in east london " it is not the police , it is not the intelligence services who will defeat terrorism .

researchers from liverpool john moores university and the roy castle lung cancer foundation carried out the study to find out why young people smoke .
the team spent 11 years interviewing 250 children from six schools , from reception class through to year six .
it found children as young as nursery age could be influenced to smoke .
improve self-image the team behind the liverpool longitudinal study on smoking -lrb- llss -rrb- said they chose children from a range of socio-economic backgrounds to take part in the study .
they found that children from lower income families were more likely to start smoking .
they also found youngsters whose parents smoke were more likely to take up the habit than those whose homes were smoke-free .
but by the age of 11 , the most important reason to take up smoking was to improve self-image , researchers said .
the process of becoming a smoker begins very early in childhood chris owens , roy castle lung cancer foundation they will now follow the same group of children until they reach the age of 16 to complete the study .
kevin barron mp , member of the all-party group on smoking and health , said : " the younger children are when they start smoking , the more likely they are to carry on , and die early from the effects of this habit .
" it is shocking to think that children have experimented with smoking by the age of eight , but the results of this study highlight the seriousness of the situation . "
chris owens , head of tobacco control at the roy castle lung cancer foundation , said 450 young people started smoking every day in the uk , and more than half would die prematurely from a smoking-related illness .
three children who took part will hand the results to prime minister tony blair on friday .
the findings will be presented to the prime minister as the government debates a public ban on smoking in the house of commons .

would he create extra bank holidays so that we could listen to his important speeches ?
would he spend his time examining the minutes of number 10 's parking sub-committee ?
would whitehall fail to meet his needs for extra filing cabinets ?
all these things are possible , judging by newly-released documents covering his time as rector of edinburgh university in the 1970s .
elected by the students , this had traditionally been an honorific post , often going to an entertainment celebrity who rarely visited the university .
running battle but it came with the rarely-exercised legal right to chair meetings of the court , the university 's governing body .
mr brown and fellow student activists realised they could use this to advance their campaigns .
in 1972 he became the second student to be elected rector .
for the next three years he fought a running battle with the university authorities , including a fierce legal dispute , which mr brown won , to confirm his right to chair meetings .
now further light has been shed on mr brown 's early activism , following the release of documents by edinburgh university in response to a request from bbc news 's freedom of information unit .
the documents confirm mr brown 's ferocious appetite for what others may regard as tedious detail .
one of his first actions as rector was to write sternly to university officials , arguing that " i must have all the business of the court on hand , in order to fulfil my function as chairman " , and so he had to receive the minutes of all court committees .
exhaustive scrutiny he attached a list of 17 committees whose minutes he wanted . "
in this time of economy i believe it is vital that the university 's finances must not only be properly managed but be seen to be so " gordon brown this included the laboratory technicians committee , the minor buildings sub-committee and the parking sub-committee .
the administrators were reluctant to let him have all he wanted .
the university secretary , its top official , wrote : " what i want to avoid is the creation in the rector 's office of another great accumulation of university papers which can be picked over by all sorts of other people as well as the rector . "
when mr brown did receive minutes his exhaustive scrutiny probably confirmed the fears of the administrators .
economy he denounced the minutes of one meeting as " inaccurate , biased and misleading " , attaching " very substantial corrections " which found flaws in 13 separate sections .
perhaps showing the frugal attitude required of a future chancellor , mr brown also pestered the university for financial information .
he demanded to see " a full list of expenses and entertainment allowances paid to members of the university administration " .
he added : " in this time of economy i believe it is vital that the university 's finances must not only be properly managed but be seen to be so . "
he wanted all spending over £ 250 to be approved by the court , which he chaired .
again , when he did get financial data , he pulled it apart , producing a comprehensive analysis of the " logical fallacies and omissions " he spotted in some figures he was given on building renovations , down to the cost of wallpaper at £ 15 per roll .
naturally the papers he collected required somewhere to put them .
mr brown was soon asking the university for an extra filing cabinet .
the request was firmly turned down by the secretary , who replied that his conception of the rector 's job did not " justify any elaborate provision for the furnishing or equipment of office premises . "
even if mr brown himself devoted his student days to carefully examining committee minutes and university accounts , he rose to the defence of his peers who may have been engaged in more traditional student pursuits .
television when the principal objected to a rise in student grants because of the amount he said students spent on alcohol , brown wrote to him asking sarcastically " whether you have an equivalent figure for members of staff " .
at this young age , mr brown seems to have been worried whether he was getting enough publicity .
in one internal memo the university 's information officer wrote : " the rector appears to be sensitive to the fact that the bbc did not contact him yesterday to appear on television .
" i told him this was a matter for the bbc to decide whether or not they should follow up any story .
in confidence i have warned the bbc news editor in edinburgh about the rector 's attitude . "
mr brown wanted to have a " formal installation ceremony " for himself as rector , with the presence of the university 's chancellor , the duke of edinburgh .
the duke 's private secretary consulted the university secretary , who warned him off , stating that " the intention is presumably to make use of the occasion and its attendant publicity for the delivery of an essentially political speech . "
academic holiday when it came to the end of his three year term brown clearly hoped to go out in style .
he planned to give a valedictory address and get the university authorities to declare the day a special academic holiday , with no lectures or classes .
this was derisively rejected .
the secretary wrote that brown 's suggested date was " singularly inappropriate " , suggesting instead that he give his address on a wednesday afternoon , a time normally free from classes anyway .
the university authorities must have been relieved to see the back of him , but even when mr brown 's rectorship ended , his legacy lived on to annoy them .
mr brown had set up an independent commission to examine the university 's relations with the local community , one of his pet subjects .
when this eventually reported , the university authorities were irritated with numerous requests for a copy from other interested higher education bodies both in britain and overseas .
they made it clear that they did not want in any way to be associated with it , sending out dismissive letters along the following lines : " the so-called commission was not set up by the university , but by a group originally under the chairmanship of our former -lrb- student -rrb- rector " , and the report " is in no way an official report by the university .

for the next three years he fought a running battle with the university authorities , including a fierce legal dispute , which mr brown won , to confirm his right to chair meetings .
now further light has been shed on mr brown 's early activism , following the release of documents by edinburgh university in response to a request from bbc news 's freedom of information unit .
the documents confirm mr brown 's ferocious appetite for what others may regard as tedious detail .
one of his first actions as rector was to write sternly to university officials , arguing that " i must have all the business of the court on hand , in order to fulfil my function as chairman " , and so he had to receive the minutes of all court committees .
exhaustive scrutiny he attached a list of 17 committees whose minutes he wanted .
in this time of economy i believe it is vital that the university 's finances must not only be properly managed but be seen to be so gordon brown this included the laboratory technicians committee , the minor buildings sub-committee and the parking sub-committee .
the administrators were reluctant to let him have all he wanted .
the university secretary , its top official , wrote : " what i want to avoid is the creation in the rector 's office of another great accumulation of university papers which can be picked over by all sorts of other people as well as the rector . "
when mr brown did receive minutes his exhaustive scrutiny probably confirmed the fears of the administrators .
economy he denounced the minutes of one meeting as " inaccurate , biased and misleading " , attaching " very substantial corrections " which found flaws in 13 separate sections .
perhaps showing the frugal attitude required of a future chancellor , mr brown also pestered the university for financial information .
he demanded to see " a full list of expenses and entertainment allowances paid to members of the university administration " .
he added : " in this time of economy i believe it is vital that the university 's finances must not only be properly managed but be seen to be so . "
he wanted all spending over £ 250 to be approved by the court , which he chaired .
in 1972 he became the second student to be elected rector again , when he did get financial data , he pulled it apart , producing a comprehensive analysis of the " logical fallacies and omissions " he spotted in some figures he was given on building renovations , down to the cost of wallpaper at £ 15 per roll .
naturally the papers he collected required somewhere to put them .
mr brown was soon asking the university for an extra filing cabinet .
the request was firmly turned down by the secretary , who replied that his conception of the rector 's job did not " justify any elaborate provision for the furnishing or equipment of office premises . "
even if mr brown himself devoted his student days to carefully examining committee minutes and university accounts , he rose to the defence of his peers who may have been engaged in more traditional student pursuits .
television when the principal objected to a rise in student grants because of the amount he said students spent on alcohol , brown wrote to him asking sarcastically " whether you have an equivalent figure for members of staff " .
at this young age , mr brown seems to have been worried whether he was getting enough publicity .
in one internal memo the university 's information officer wrote : " the rector appears to be sensitive to the fact that the bbc did not contact him yesterday to appear on television .
" i told him this was a matter for the bbc to decide whether or not they should follow up any story .
in confidence i have warned the bbc news editor in edinburgh about the rector 's attitude . "
mr brown wanted to have a " formal installation ceremony " for himself as rector , with the presence of the university 's chancellor , the duke of edinburgh .
the duke 's private secretary consulted the university secretary , who warned him off , stating that " the intention is presumably to make use of the occasion and its attendant publicity for the delivery of an essentially political speech . "
academic holiday when it came to the end of his three year term brown clearly hoped to go out in style .
he planned to give a valedictory address and get the university authorities to declare the day a special academic holiday , with no lectures or classes .
this was derisively rejected .
the secretary wrote that brown 's suggested date was " singularly inappropriate " , suggesting instead that he give his address on a wednesday afternoon , a time normally free from classes anyway .
the university authorities must have been relieved to see the back of him , but even when mr brown 's rectorship ended , his legacy lived on to annoy them .
mr brown had set up an independent commission to examine the university 's relations with the local community , one of his pet subjects .
when this eventually reported , the university authorities were irritated with numerous requests for a copy from other interested higher education bodies both in britain and overseas .
they made it clear that they did not want in any way to be associated with it , sending out dismissive letters along the following lines : " the so-called commission was not set up by the university , but by a group originally under the chairmanship of our former -lrb- student -rrb- rector " , and the report " is in no way an official report by the university .

st ives in cornwall and whitesands beach in pembrokeshire have both been ranked in the world 's top 20 , under the formula developed by dr dimitrios buhalis at the university of surrey .
a total of 250 resorts were judged on factors including beach quality and friendliness of local people .
the list has been published by online travel firm opodo .
tourism officials hope the ranking , under a formula which included predictions for this year 's hot weather , will help bring in more visitors .
the top rated beach in the uk was at st ives in cornwall , which ranked fourth in the world .
whitesands was listed 18th behind copacabana in rio and st tropez but ahead of bora bora and natadola in fiji .
the next welsh beaches in the list were rhossili on gower and two more pembrokeshire beaches - tenby and barafundle not far behind .
' winning formula ' the formula takes into account scenery and the beach 's popularity as well as more measurable qualities such as its facilities , activities , weather , and length .
other factors include the time of travelling to the beach , and more surprisingly the quality of the shopping and even the friendliness of local people .
dr buhalis said of whitesands : " it 's a lovely beach and the hot weather this summer is another factor . "
he said uk resorts which offered reasonable travel time and cost could benefit from weekend toursim .
" we 're finding increasingly that people are taking two , three , even four holidays a year .
this may be a couple of weeks for a long-haul holiday , but people are also going for short breaks in the uk . "
pembrokeshire council said it was delighted that the beach , popular with surfers and campers , had been judged one of the best .
councillor rob lewis , who has responsibility for tourism in the cabinet , said : " it 's a fantastic beach in a wonderful , unspoilt area , and we work very hard to keep it that way . "
top beaches 1 tuscan riviera , italy 2 tarifa , spain 3 south beach , miami 4 st ives , cornwall 18 whitesands , st davids 19 bora bora , french polyn 20 natadola , fiji matt o 'brien of the st davids-based tyf adventure centre said their instructors had worked and travelled in different parts of the world but whitesands compared well .
" once you 've been here you appreciate how nice it is and our water sports instructors have been to the best beaches in the world and they keep coming back .
" it 's good to go on holiday to somewhere new , whether it 's fiji or barbados but to have something here which is regarded as world class is important . "
a spokeswoman for the wales tourist board said : " it 's interesting to see that the winning formula not only includes beach quality but that factors such as culture and history and friendliness of the local people " .

shirky talks of an explosion of creative collaboration " i am predicting 50 years of chaos , " says leading digital thinker clay shirky .
" loosely organised groups will be increasingly given leverage .
" institutions will come under increasing degrees of pressures and the more rigid they are , the more pressures they will come under .
" it is going to be a mass re-adjustment , " he says , addressing delegates at the ted -lrb- technology , entertainment and design -rrb- conference in oxford , uk .
ted brings together experts in design , technology , and entertainment to share their ideas about the future .
in our hands at a time when companies are grappling with how to make cool new stuff , it is the rising tide of creative collaborators working through the channel and tools of the net that is showing the way ahead .
this is not a new trend , explains tony blair 's favourite political analyst and author charles leadbeater .
wales ' wikipedia shows distributed group of people can work effectively the mountain bike was created out of the frustrations of a few northern californians who were dissatisfied with ordinary bikes and racers .
they took what they wanted from those to create something entirely different .
this was 10 to 15 years before the big companies saw the commercial value , explains mr leadbeater .
about 65 % of bike sales in the us are mountain bikes now .
" it is when the net combines with these passionate consumers that you get the explosion of creative collaboration , " says mr leadbeater .
" out of that you get the need for better organisations ; how do you organise yourself without organisation ? "
it is indeed a challenge getting a very large , distributed group of people to work in an effective , valuable , collaborative way , says mr shirky .
but efforts such as the online encyclopaedia wikipedia show that people power can and does work .
it is not just a community that runs wild .
there are volunteers and voting systems in place to ensure accuracy and decency .
its founder , jimmy wales , is the " monarch " who will take tough decisions if need be , though this has not happened very often .
power of the masses just because something is created by anyone with a net connection and some sort of know-how , existing outside of formal , does not make it any less accurate or useful , say the digital thinkers of our times .
" for the first time since the industrial revolution , the most important means and components of core economies are in the hands of the population at large , " explains yale law professor yochai benkler .
computation , in other words , is in the hands of the entire population .
and those computing tools are getting easier to use , more approachable , as well as more powerful .
if you are a games community with a million players , you only need one percent to be co-developers .
imagine that working in education , or the nhs charles leadbeater blogging , services , tag-based applications to help people find content , peer-to-peer ways of distributing content , grid computing , open source software , are all examples of how this is happening online now .
ordinary people can become photographers whose images are used all over the world , for instance .
tagging them with keywords helps others find and classify them usefully .
this act of tagging does not require swathes of trained librarians .
what these power tools enable is the ability for people with small ideas to make them real , share them , and let them grow .
but this philosophy has many big companies jittery .
there are obstacles to overcome .
this is what creativity is about , but mr leadbeater argues there is a further challenge in thinking about how creativity comes about .
it is not about creative people hired by big companies wearing colourful baseball caps , thinking up whacky ideas in an office with grass for a carpet , he says .
professor benkler describes this as a new " transactional framework " if you speak economics .
in other words , it is essentially the first system of social production , sharing and exchange for a long time that is actually making companies sit up and listen , because they have to .
money and communities big companies are now seeing the economic opportunity of this kind of open , collaborative production , by the people , making social production a fact and not just a fad .
mr leadbeater 's job is to work out how these new ways of working can be embraced as part of public policy , where people get something back - not necessarily in monetary form - for what they contribute .
" it is about companies built on communities ; the company provides the community with the tools it needs , " he says .
" if you are a games community with a million players , you only need one percent to be co-developers .
imagine that working in education , or the nhs .
" some sort of middle ground is going to be the most productive . "
as for the next 50 years , it is up to the generation which has no idea what a real library looks like inside to decide how it will work out , says mr shirky .
our entire approach to patents and intellectual property and innovation so far has been based on the idea that the inventor tells us what something is for , says mr leadbeater .
that has to change ; patents and copyright have to move with that and be about orchestrating that creativity rather than smothering it .
to mr shirky , there is one thing we can do now : " since we can see it is coming , we might as well get good at it . "
