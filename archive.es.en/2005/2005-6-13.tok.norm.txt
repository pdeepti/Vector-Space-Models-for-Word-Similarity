program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany germany -pipe- 13.06.2005 private universities take hold in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american-style graduation at international university bremen while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way . choosing the private , tuition-funded international university in germany was n't a difficult choice to make for frank strzelczyk .
at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to .

kathtreff 's database of like-minded catholics is open for perusal .
the site was launched in may , and so far , around 300 participants have registered . kathtreff is the brainchild of austrian bishop andreas laun .
the 62-year-old is known for holding very traditional catholic views on sex and marriage .
but he was inspired to take the high-tech road to match-making by a young couple , who told him of how they each longed to find a partner with compatible values . kathtreff cautions the hopeful not to expect too much too fast , and recommends that they continue to try and meet the man or woman for a lifetime outside the virtual world of the internet .
equally important , the site advises , is to accompany the search for a spouse with daily prayer .

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .

eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks . the current president of the eu , luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , attempted to create some movement on the thorny budget issue with a series of confidential one-on-one talks with eu heads of state prior to foreign ministers ' meeting .
but diplomats from luxembourg are n't counting on any concrete results until after their last bilateral meeting with british prime minister tony blair on tuesday . only if britain were to forgo its multi-billion euro eu budget rebate will there be agreement by the end of this week 's general eu summit on the eu budgetary framework for the period 2007-2013 . british rebate for more than 20 years now , britain has been granted a rebate on its eu contributions that currently totals 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.63 billion -rrb- annually .
the remaining 24 member states at least want to achieve a freeze on the rebate , which was granted to britain 21 years ago when the island nation was among the poorer states in the union .
although its situation has fundamentally changed , the british government has rejected every attempt to renegotiate , something tony blair stressed again last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair " the uk rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away .
period , " blair said before parliament . other net contributors germany , the netherlands and sweden are also demanding a sort of rebate , arguing that on a per capita basis , their payments into brussels ' coffers are too high .
germany contributes between six and seven billion euros a year . italy and portugal have rejected the planned cuts to regional subsidies included in the negotiation package .
italian foreign minister gianfranco fini warned earlier that italy would not hesitate to use a veto on the budget proposal . the nine member states in eastern europe are demanding more financial support , and france is refusing to budge on the issue of agricultural payments , from which it benefits the most .
germany and the five other net contributors officially support capping the budget at one percent of the eu 's gross national income , although it 's on this point that a compromise would be most likely . " masterstroke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu budget debate : a tangled web of issues it would be a masterstroke by juncker were he to succeed in unravelling this complex knot of budget issues , say eu diplomats in brussels . following the negative constitutional referendums , the netherlands and france have barely any room to manoeuvre .
german chancellor gerhard schröder is widely seen as a lame duck and will most likely not get drawn into any wide-reaching obligations .
juncker is of the opinion that the heads of state need to prove their willingness to act with a budget compromise , now that the eu constitution has been put on ice . the constitutional crisis is not officially on the eu foreign ministers ' agenda .
how the ratification process is to go on and in which direction the eu should develop is a matter for the heads of state to resolve at their summit later this week . confirming expansion plans in luxembourg , the foreign ministers want to reconfirm the assurances that have already been given for the next round of expansion .
romania and bulgaria are due to be taken into the fold on jan .
1 , 2007 , if they have completed all the required reforms .
the beginning of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 will be reaffirmed .
a date for beginning talks with croatia is not yet in sight due to unsatisfactory cooperation from zagreb with the war crimes tribunal in the hague . the eu continues to hold onto the goal of allowing the remaining balkan nations - macedonia , bosnia-herzegovina , albania and serbia-montenegro - into the club , despite the fact that there is no foreseeable agreement on a constitutional framework for an eu of 30 or more members . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , britain clash over eu budget gerhard schröder has said germany is willing to compromise on the eu budget , but britain is sticking to its guns , claiming it will use a veto if need be to retain its discounted payments .

the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market . in eyeing hypovereinsbank for a possible takeover , unicredito 's board must have been looking past the bavarian bank 's 2 billion euros in losses last year and lower revenues .
they must have been looking east . following the takeover of the bank of austria in 2000 , hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , itself the product merger of bavarian banks in 1998 , became sole leader in the new europe .
with unicredit banca as its new parent in a stock swap valued at 15.1 billion euros , the new bank will stretch from the baltics down to macedonia and ukraine .
dominating the east " we are creating the first truly european bank , " said hvb chief executive dieter rampl on sunday . combined , germany 's number two bank and italy 's number one will reach 28 million customers in 19 european countries .
the synergies resulting out of the deal will generate 985 million euros in pre-tax revenue annually , according to reports .
unicredit will also get hvb 's eastern european assets , totalling an estimated 20 billion euros .
after the fusion the two banks will be twice as large in the former eastern bloc as their nearest competitor . eastern europe " is the main goal , " in the takeover , said analyst robert fürchtl , of hauck & aufhäuser .
german workers safe - for now but profits in the east will come at a price .
up to 9,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the merger , say analysts and union representatives .
unicredit will also take on hvb 's debt-laden real estate sector .
analysts wrote ahead of the fusion that unicredit ceo alessandro profumo would have his work cut out for him . bildunterschrift : " the most important question is whether unicredito can improve hvb in germany , " wrote analysts for citigroup smith barney , according to germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . at the moment , it seems german government officials wo n't have to worry about further bad news regarding the country 's miserable job market .
the job cuts look to take place in eastern europe , leaving the 26,000 employees in germany untouched for now . more to come ? " i think this will pave the way for further consolidation in european banking , " metehan sen , an analyst at sal .
oppenheim , told reuters .
cross-border fusions are a relatively new thing in europe .

eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks . the current president of the eu , luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , attempted to create some movement on the thorny budget issue with a series of confidential one-on-one talks with eu heads of state prior to foreign ministers ' meeting .
but diplomats from luxembourg are n't counting on any concrete results until after their last bilateral meeting with british prime minister tony blair on tuesday . only if britain were to forgo its multi-billion euro eu budget rebate will there be agreement by the end of this week 's general eu summit on the eu budgetary framework for the period 2007-2013 . british rebate for more than 20 years now , britain has been granted a rebate on its eu contributions that currently totals 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.63 billion -rrb- annually .
the remaining 24 member states at least want to achieve a freeze on the rebate , which was granted to britain 21 years ago when the island nation was among the poorer states in the union .
although its situation has fundamentally changed , the british government has rejected every attempt to renegotiate , something tony blair stressed again last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair " the uk rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away .
period , " blair said before parliament . other net contributors germany , the netherlands and sweden are also demanding a sort of rebate , arguing that on a per capita basis , their payments into brussels ' coffers are too high .
germany contributes between six and seven billion euros a year . italy and portugal have rejected the planned cuts to regional subsidies included in the negotiation package .
italian foreign minister gianfranco fini warned earlier that italy would not hesitate to use a veto on the budget proposal . the nine member states in eastern europe are demanding more financial support , and france is refusing to budge on the issue of agricultural payments , from which it benefits the most .
germany and the five other net contributors officially support capping the budget at one percent of the eu 's gross national income , although it 's on this point that a compromise would be most likely .

eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks . the current president of the eu , luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , attempted to create some movement on the thorny budget issue with a series of confidential one-on-one talks with eu heads of state prior to foreign ministers ' meeting .
but diplomats from luxembourg are n't counting on any concrete results until after their last bilateral meeting with british prime minister tony blair on tuesday . only if britain were to forgo its multi-billion euro eu budget rebate will there be agreement by the end of this week 's general eu summit on the eu budgetary framework for the period 2007-2013 . british rebate for more than 20 years now , britain has been granted a rebate on its eu contributions that currently totals 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.63 billion -rrb- annually .
the remaining 24 member states at least want to achieve a freeze on the rebate , which was granted to britain 21 years ago when the island nation was among the poorer states in the union .
although its situation has fundamentally changed , the british government has rejected every attempt to renegotiate , something tony blair stressed again last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair " the uk rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away .

germany contributes between six and seven billion euros a year . italy and portugal have rejected the planned cuts to regional subsidies included in the negotiation package .
italian foreign minister gianfranco fini warned earlier that italy would not hesitate to use a veto on the budget proposal . the nine member states in eastern europe are demanding more financial support , and france is refusing to budge on the issue of agricultural payments , from which it benefits the most .
germany and the five other net contributors officially support capping the budget at one percent of the eu 's gross national income , although it 's on this point that a compromise would be most likely .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 italy rejects easing assisted fertility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters reminding italians to vote , failed to have much impact a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot . there was no escaping the mood of election apathy on monday , when voters merely trickled into polling stations to have their say on the issue of whether or not italy is ready to embrace a change in its bioethics law . only around a quarter of italian voters turned out to have their say in the referendum .
following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s . " te deum " praise of thanks although top prelates and the vatican kept a low profile as the voting continued , father gianni baget bozzo , a priest linked to prime minister silvio berlusconi , said he was preparing a " te deum " hymn of thanksgiving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infuriated and embittered supporters of change accused the church of outstepping its sphere . " those who are sensitive to the influence of the pope let themselves be conditioned and gave up their right to free choice , " lamented michele fasanella , an arts student from the southern italian city of potenza . " there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks . the current president of the eu , luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , attempted to create some movement on the thorny budget issue with a series of confidential one-on-one talks with eu heads of state prior to foreign ministers ' meeting .
but diplomats from luxembourg are n't counting on any concrete results until after their last bilateral meeting with british prime minister tony blair on tuesday . only if britain were to forgo its multi-billion euro eu budget rebate will there be agreement by the end of this week 's general eu summit on the eu budgetary framework for the period 2007-2013 . british rebate for more than 20 years now , britain has been granted a rebate on its eu contributions that currently totals 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.63 billion -rrb- annually .
the remaining 24 member states at least want to achieve a freeze on the rebate , which was granted to britain 21 years ago when the island nation was among the poorer states in the union .
although its situation has fundamentally changed , the british government has rejected every attempt to renegotiate , something tony blair stressed again last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair " the uk rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away .

germany contributes between six and seven billion euros a year . italy and portugal have rejected the planned cuts to regional subsidies included in the negotiation package .
italian foreign minister gianfranco fini warned earlier that italy would not hesitate to use a veto on the budget proposal . the nine member states in eastern europe are demanding more financial support , and france is refusing to budge on the issue of agricultural payments , from which it benefits the most .
germany and the five other net contributors officially support capping the budget at one percent of the eu 's gross national income , although it 's on this point that a compromise would be most likely . " masterstroke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu budget debate : a tangled web of issues it would be a masterstroke by juncker were he to succeed in unravelling this complex knot of budget issues , say eu diplomats in brussels . following the negative constitutional referendums , the netherlands and france have barely any room to manoeuvre .
german chancellor gerhard schröder is widely seen as a lame duck and will most likely not get drawn into any wide-reaching obligations .
juncker is of the opinion that the heads of state need to prove their willingness to act with a budget compromise , now that the eu constitution has been put on ice . the constitutional crisis is not officially on the eu foreign ministers ' agenda .
how the ratification process is to go on and in which direction the eu should develop is a matter for the heads of state to resolve at their summit later this week . confirming expansion plans in luxembourg , the foreign ministers want to reconfirm the assurances that have already been given for the next round of expansion .

" there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

but in germany , help is on the way in the form of an online dating portal . must be : attractive , outgoing , successful , funny . let 's face it , it 's tough enough for singles to find a potential mate on the dating market without having to add to the list " practicing catholic who subscribes to the church 's teachings on love , sex and marriage .

kathtreff 's database of like-minded catholics is open for perusal .
the site was launched in may , and so far , around 300 participants have registered . kathtreff is the brainchild of austrian bishop andreas laun .
the 62-year-old is known for holding very traditional catholic views on sex and marriage .
but he was inspired to take the high-tech road to match-making by a young couple , who told him of how they each longed to find a partner with compatible values . kathtreff cautions the hopeful not to expect too much too fast , and recommends that they continue to try and meet the man or woman for a lifetime outside the virtual world of the internet .
equally important , the site advises , is to accompany the search for a spouse with daily prayer .

but there are efforts afoot to create a more peaceful picture . a recent competition run by the bertelsmann foundation and the german interior ministry invited more than one hundred communities to take part in a competition called " immigrant integration - strategies for local integration policies . " in the category of medium-sized towns , first prize went to north rhine-westphalia 's solingen , where young people in particular have been involved in a number of projects aimed at encouraging the integration of refugees and foreigners . overcoming the past solingen 's fairly modest population of 163,000 people draws from 130 different countries , lending the city a colorful , melting pot feel which is not altogether characteristic of germany .
this image of cross cultural harmony can be attributed , at least in part , to the concerted efforts of the town authorities to consign its bad reputation to the annals of time . back in 1993 , solingen hit the headlines when right wing extremists set fire to the house of a turkish family , claiming five lives .
it was enough to spur the townspeople into action , and they quickly set up a number of projects designed at preventing the city from being forever dubbed a hub of xenophobic activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house in solingen in which five people died in 1993 one particularly successful project is a soccer tournament called " cup without borders , " which julia reithmeier of the youth city council , says is for kids who play football on the streets . " young people , and especially refugee children rarely get the opportunity to join a soccer club , which means they end up playing on the streets .
we organised this tournament in order to give such teams the chance to get a taste of success , " she said . active minors solingen also has a very active youth city council , which is made up of german and foreign youths who are elected by school children from the town .
they work closely with the official city council , offering opportunities for meeting new people and getting out of the rut of aimless hanging out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solingen became active after the 1993 arson attack the young council also masterminded a project for promoting tolerance and civil courage , and awards a " silver shoe " for people who stand up to racial hatred in public . in the name of the project school children raised funds for social events in order to give refugee kids the chance to mingle with the more established inhabitants of solingen , and additionally , to finance a homework program for those who are struggling at school . julia reithmeier believes that such programs do n't only benefit refugee children , but also those who are involved in their organisation .
" through this kind of work , they can learn to deal with problems , to address serious issues and develop a sense of responsibility .

the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .

whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .

at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .
after all , debt relief does create new life opportunities if it 's supported by the political elite - in africa that is the case in countries such as mali , benin , senegal and particularly mozambique , a showcase nation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children from the gambia write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia .
elsewhere , such as in uganda , four million more children go to school today thanks to prior initiatives to reduce debt ; 31,000 new classrooms and 18,000 new teachers are in place in tanzania and half a million children have been vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria in mozambique . new demands on struggling european nations despite those staggering statistics , it all seems like a mere drop in the ocean when one takes a look at the huge goals that the united nations set itself in its jubilee year in 2000 , such as halving world poverty .
the un also wants to accelerate the education and development chances of the world 's poorest by 2015 in spite of continuing population growth . that means the goal has actually grown larger ever since it was declared - and the current g8 decision also shows that world politics has set itself an ambitious and tight deadline despite floundering economic conditions in a row of rich donor nations .
whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .
today , that share hovers at around 0.4 percent among european states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transfair seal on bananas but , most importantly - and this is where the key for the reduction of poverty lies - permanent development can only arise when the poorest countries also have access to the world 's markets and when tea , coffee , cotton , sugar or corn can be sold worldwide without duties and other trade barriers .
skeptics go as far as to suggest that if the current round of doha talks at the world trade organization fail to achieve a real opening of the markets , then the millennium goals of the un are doomed . so far , the millennium goals have helped to make it clear that battling poverty is a responsibility for all fields of politics , they 've also managed to attract public interest in the topic , which slipped too often off the agenda of international institutions . even the g8 finance ministers know too well : fighting poverty counts just as much as drafting security measures and is thus not just a policy for the poor but also an important political goal for the donor nations . ute schaeffer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 scrap debt of poorest nations the finance ministers of the world 's eight wealthiest nations agreed saturday on a deal for immediate 100 percent multilateral debt relief totaling $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- for 18 of the world 's poorest countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 italy rejects easing assisted fertility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters reminding italians to vote , failed to have much impact a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot . there was no escaping the mood of election apathy on monday , when voters merely trickled into polling stations to have their say on the issue of whether or not italy is ready to embrace a change in its bioethics law . only around a quarter of italian voters turned out to have their say in the referendum .
following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s . " te deum " praise of thanks although top prelates and the vatican kept a low profile as the voting continued , father gianni baget bozzo , a priest linked to prime minister silvio berlusconi , said he was preparing a " te deum " hymn of thanksgiving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infuriated and embittered supporters of change accused the church of outstepping its sphere . " those who are sensitive to the influence of the pope let themselves be conditioned and gave up their right to free choice , " lamented michele fasanella , an arts student from the southern italian city of potenza . " there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to .

the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market . in eyeing hypovereinsbank for a possible takeover , unicredito 's board must have been looking past the bavarian bank 's 2 billion euros in losses last year and lower revenues .
they must have been looking east . following the takeover of the bank of austria in 2000 , hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , itself the product merger of bavarian banks in 1998 , became sole leader in the new europe .
with unicredit banca as its new parent in a stock swap valued at 15.1 billion euros , the new bank will stretch from the baltics down to macedonia and ukraine .
dominating the east " we are creating the first truly european bank , " said hvb chief executive dieter rampl on sunday . combined , germany 's number two bank and italy 's number one will reach 28 million customers in 19 european countries .
the synergies resulting out of the deal will generate 985 million euros in pre-tax revenue annually , according to reports .
unicredit will also get hvb 's eastern european assets , totalling an estimated 20 billion euros .
after the fusion the two banks will be twice as large in the former eastern bloc as their nearest competitor . eastern europe " is the main goal , " in the takeover , said analyst robert fürchtl , of hauck & aufhäuser .
german workers safe - for now but profits in the east will come at a price .
up to 9,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the merger , say analysts and union representatives .
unicredit will also take on hvb 's debt-laden real estate sector .
analysts wrote ahead of the fusion that unicredit ceo alessandro profumo would have his work cut out for him . bildunterschrift : " the most important question is whether unicredito can improve hvb in germany , " wrote analysts for citigroup smith barney , according to germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . at the moment , it seems german government officials wo n't have to worry about further bad news regarding the country 's miserable job market .
the job cuts look to take place in eastern europe , leaving the 26,000 employees in germany untouched for now . more to come ? " i think this will pave the way for further consolidation in european banking , " metehan sen , an analyst at sal .
oppenheim , told reuters .
cross-border fusions are a relatively new thing in europe .
the takeover last year of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispano for 12.5 billion euros was the region 's first major fusion .
but others are starting to follow . dutch banking leader abn amro is eager to buy up italy 's banca atoniana popolare veneta , the country 's seventh-largest bank .
at the end of march spain 's bbva completed a 6.4 billion euro takeover of italy 's banca natzionale del livoro . foreign banks have been more hesitant in germany , mainly because the country 's top three - deutsche bank , hvb and commerzbank - have a less than 20 percent share of the consumer market .
a major fusion could change that , prophesized commerzbank ceo klaus peter müller in an interview with germany 's focus magazine in april .
" as soon as a foreign bank snaps up a major -lrb- german -rrb- bank , the offers for others will follow relatively quickly , " müller said .
" the race among foreigners after a comprehensive network in germany will begin . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 opinion : fighting poverty needs more than debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slashing of debts is hoped to contribute towards reducing poverty even as g8 finance ministers celebrate their pivotal decision to write off the debts of the world 's poorest countries , deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer writes that the move alone is n't enough to combat poverty . " a historic decision , " the " biggest debt relief program that the world has ever seen " and " a success for the world " : finance ministers of the world 's leading industrialized nations and russia -lrb- g8 -rrb- were reaching for superlatives after saturday 's decision to write off debts of 38 countries in africa and latin america , amounting to a whopping $ 55 billion . eighteen countries will immediately have their debt burdens cancelled , while 20 more are expected to profit from it later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , addresses global business leaders at downing street , london , thursday june 9 , 2005 , ahead of the g8 summit .
the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .
after all , debt relief does create new life opportunities if it 's supported by the political elite - in africa that is the case in countries such as mali , benin , senegal and particularly mozambique , a showcase nation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children from the gambia write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia .
elsewhere , such as in uganda , four million more children go to school today thanks to prior initiatives to reduce debt ; 31,000 new classrooms and 18,000 new teachers are in place in tanzania and half a million children have been vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria in mozambique . new demands on struggling european nations despite those staggering statistics , it all seems like a mere drop in the ocean when one takes a look at the huge goals that the united nations set itself in its jubilee year in 2000 , such as halving world poverty .
the un also wants to accelerate the education and development chances of the world 's poorest by 2015 in spite of continuing population growth . that means the goal has actually grown larger ever since it was declared - and the current g8 decision also shows that world politics has set itself an ambitious and tight deadline despite floundering economic conditions in a row of rich donor nations .
whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .
today , that share hovers at around 0.4 percent among european states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transfair seal on bananas but , most importantly - and this is where the key for the reduction of poverty lies - permanent development can only arise when the poorest countries also have access to the world 's markets and when tea , coffee , cotton , sugar or corn can be sold worldwide without duties and other trade barriers .
skeptics go as far as to suggest that if the current round of doha talks at the world trade organization fail to achieve a real opening of the markets , then the millennium goals of the un are doomed . so far , the millennium goals have helped to make it clear that battling poverty is a responsibility for all fields of politics , they 've also managed to attract public interest in the topic , which slipped too often off the agenda of international institutions . even the g8 finance ministers know too well : fighting poverty counts just as much as drafting security measures and is thus not just a policy for the poor but also an important political goal for the donor nations . ute schaeffer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 scrap debt of poorest nations the finance ministers of the world 's eight wealthiest nations agreed saturday on a deal for immediate 100 percent multilateral debt relief totaling $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- for 18 of the world 's poorest countries .

the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market . in eyeing hypovereinsbank for a possible takeover , unicredito 's board must have been looking past the bavarian bank 's 2 billion euros in losses last year and lower revenues .
they must have been looking east . following the takeover of the bank of austria in 2000 , hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , itself the product merger of bavarian banks in 1998 , became sole leader in the new europe .
with unicredit banca as its new parent in a stock swap valued at 15.1 billion euros , the new bank will stretch from the baltics down to macedonia and ukraine .
dominating the east " we are creating the first truly european bank , " said hvb chief executive dieter rampl on sunday . combined , germany 's number two bank and italy 's number one will reach 28 million customers in 19 european countries .
the synergies resulting out of the deal will generate 985 million euros in pre-tax revenue annually , according to reports .
unicredit will also get hvb 's eastern european assets , totalling an estimated 20 billion euros .
after the fusion the two banks will be twice as large in the former eastern bloc as their nearest competitor . eastern europe " is the main goal , " in the takeover , said analyst robert fürchtl , of hauck & aufhäuser .
german workers safe - for now but profits in the east will come at a price .
up to 9,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the merger , say analysts and union representatives .
unicredit will also take on hvb 's debt-laden real estate sector .
analysts wrote ahead of the fusion that unicredit ceo alessandro profumo would have his work cut out for him . bildunterschrift : " the most important question is whether unicredito can improve hvb in germany , " wrote analysts for citigroup smith barney , according to germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . at the moment , it seems german government officials wo n't have to worry about further bad news regarding the country 's miserable job market .
the job cuts look to take place in eastern europe , leaving the 26,000 employees in germany untouched for now . more to come ? " i think this will pave the way for further consolidation in european banking , " metehan sen , an analyst at sal .
oppenheim , told reuters .
cross-border fusions are a relatively new thing in europe .
the takeover last year of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispano for 12.5 billion euros was the region 's first major fusion .
but others are starting to follow . dutch banking leader abn amro is eager to buy up italy 's banca atoniana popolare veneta , the country 's seventh-largest bank .
at the end of march spain 's bbva completed a 6.4 billion euro takeover of italy 's banca natzionale del livoro . foreign banks have been more hesitant in germany , mainly because the country 's top three - deutsche bank , hvb and commerzbank - have a less than 20 percent share of the consumer market .
a major fusion could change that , prophesized commerzbank ceo klaus peter müller in an interview with germany 's focus magazine in april .
" as soon as a foreign bank snaps up a major -lrb- german -rrb- bank , the offers for others will follow relatively quickly , " müller said .
" the race among foreigners after a comprehensive network in germany will begin . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .
unicredito plans to offer more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in a stock swap in the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe .
-lrb- june 11 , 2005 -rrb- bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled .

kathtreff 's database of like-minded catholics is open for perusal .
the site was launched in may , and so far , around 300 participants have registered . kathtreff is the brainchild of austrian bishop andreas laun .
the 62-year-old is known for holding very traditional catholic views on sex and marriage .
but he was inspired to take the high-tech road to match-making by a young couple , who told him of how they each longed to find a partner with compatible values . kathtreff cautions the hopeful not to expect too much too fast , and recommends that they continue to try and meet the man or woman for a lifetime outside the virtual world of the internet .
equally important , the site advises , is to accompany the search for a spouse with daily prayer .

following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s .

" there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 italy rejects easing assisted fertility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters reminding italians to vote , failed to have much impact a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot . there was no escaping the mood of election apathy on monday , when voters merely trickled into polling stations to have their say on the issue of whether or not italy is ready to embrace a change in its bioethics law . only around a quarter of italian voters turned out to have their say in the referendum .
following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s . " te deum " praise of thanks although top prelates and the vatican kept a low profile as the voting continued , father gianni baget bozzo , a priest linked to prime minister silvio berlusconi , said he was preparing a " te deum " hymn of thanksgiving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infuriated and embittered supporters of change accused the church of outstepping its sphere . " those who are sensitive to the influence of the pope let themselves be conditioned and gave up their right to free choice , " lamented michele fasanella , an arts student from the southern italian city of potenza . " there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

kathtreff 's database of like-minded catholics is open for perusal .
the site was launched in may , and so far , around 300 participants have registered . kathtreff is the brainchild of austrian bishop andreas laun .
the 62-year-old is known for holding very traditional catholic views on sex and marriage .
but he was inspired to take the high-tech road to match-making by a young couple , who told him of how they each longed to find a partner with compatible values . kathtreff cautions the hopeful not to expect too much too fast , and recommends that they continue to try and meet the man or woman for a lifetime outside the virtual world of the internet .
equally important , the site advises , is to accompany the search for a spouse with daily prayer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 opinion : fighting poverty needs more than debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slashing of debts is hoped to contribute towards reducing poverty even as g8 finance ministers celebrate their pivotal decision to write off the debts of the world 's poorest countries , deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer writes that the move alone is n't enough to combat poverty . " a historic decision , " the " biggest debt relief program that the world has ever seen " and " a success for the world " : finance ministers of the world 's leading industrialized nations and russia -lrb- g8 -rrb- were reaching for superlatives after saturday 's decision to write off debts of 38 countries in africa and latin america , amounting to a whopping $ 55 billion . eighteen countries will immediately have their debt burdens cancelled , while 20 more are expected to profit from it later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , addresses global business leaders at downing street , london , thursday june 9 , 2005 , ahead of the g8 summit .
the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .
after all , debt relief does create new life opportunities if it 's supported by the political elite - in africa that is the case in countries such as mali , benin , senegal and particularly mozambique , a showcase nation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children from the gambia write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia .
elsewhere , such as in uganda , four million more children go to school today thanks to prior initiatives to reduce debt ; 31,000 new classrooms and 18,000 new teachers are in place in tanzania and half a million children have been vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria in mozambique . new demands on struggling european nations despite those staggering statistics , it all seems like a mere drop in the ocean when one takes a look at the huge goals that the united nations set itself in its jubilee year in 2000 , such as halving world poverty .
the un also wants to accelerate the education and development chances of the world 's poorest by 2015 in spite of continuing population growth . that means the goal has actually grown larger ever since it was declared - and the current g8 decision also shows that world politics has set itself an ambitious and tight deadline despite floundering economic conditions in a row of rich donor nations .
whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .
today , that share hovers at around 0.4 percent among european states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transfair seal on bananas but , most importantly - and this is where the key for the reduction of poverty lies - permanent development can only arise when the poorest countries also have access to the world 's markets and when tea , coffee , cotton , sugar or corn can be sold worldwide without duties and other trade barriers .
skeptics go as far as to suggest that if the current round of doha talks at the world trade organization fail to achieve a real opening of the markets , then the millennium goals of the un are doomed . so far , the millennium goals have helped to make it clear that battling poverty is a responsibility for all fields of politics , they 've also managed to attract public interest in the topic , which slipped too often off the agenda of international institutions . even the g8 finance ministers know too well : fighting poverty counts just as much as drafting security measures and is thus not just a policy for the poor but also an important political goal for the donor nations . ute schaeffer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 scrap debt of poorest nations the finance ministers of the world 's eight wealthiest nations agreed saturday on a deal for immediate 100 percent multilateral debt relief totaling $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- for 18 of the world 's poorest countries .
-lrb- june 11 , 2005 -rrb- g8 focuses on debt relief top finance officials of the group of eight industrialized nations kicked off a meeting in london friday to try to clinch agreement on unprecedented debt relief for the world 's poorest countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany germany -pipe- 13.06.2005 private universities take hold in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american-style graduation at international university bremen while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way . choosing the private , tuition-funded international university in germany was n't a difficult choice to make for frank strzelczyk .
at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .
-lrb- june 6 , 2005 -rrb- are german universities losing their luster ?

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .

they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .

the remaining 24 member states at least want to achieve a freeze on the rebate , which was granted to britain 21 years ago when the island nation was among the poorer states in the union .

italian foreign minister gianfranco fini warned earlier that italy would not hesitate to use a veto on the budget proposal . the nine member states in eastern europe are demanding more financial support , and france is refusing to budge on the issue of agricultural payments , from which it benefits the most .
germany and the five other net contributors officially support capping the budget at one percent of the eu 's gross national income , although it 's on this point that a compromise would be most likely .

but diplomats from luxembourg are n't counting on any concrete results until after their last bilateral meeting with british prime minister tony blair on tuesday . only if britain were to forgo its multi-billion euro eu budget rebate will there be agreement by the end of this week 's general eu summit on the eu budgetary framework for the period 2007-2013 . british rebate for more than 20 years now , britain has been granted a rebate on its eu contributions that currently totals 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.63 billion -rrb- annually .
the remaining 24 member states at least want to achieve a freeze on the rebate , which was granted to britain 21 years ago when the island nation was among the poorer states in the union .
although its situation has fundamentally changed , the british government has rejected every attempt to renegotiate , something tony blair stressed again last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair " the uk rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away .

germany contributes between six and seven billion euros a year . italy and portugal have rejected the planned cuts to regional subsidies included in the negotiation package .
italian foreign minister gianfranco fini warned earlier that italy would not hesitate to use a veto on the budget proposal . the nine member states in eastern europe are demanding more financial support , and france is refusing to budge on the issue of agricultural payments , from which it benefits the most .
germany and the five other net contributors officially support capping the budget at one percent of the eu 's gross national income , although it 's on this point that a compromise would be most likely . " masterstroke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu budget debate : a tangled web of issues it would be a masterstroke by juncker were he to succeed in unravelling this complex knot of budget issues , say eu diplomats in brussels . following the negative constitutional referendums , the netherlands and france have barely any room to manoeuvre .
german chancellor gerhard schröder is widely seen as a lame duck and will most likely not get drawn into any wide-reaching obligations .
juncker is of the opinion that the heads of state need to prove their willingness to act with a budget compromise , now that the eu constitution has been put on ice . the constitutional crisis is not officially on the eu foreign ministers ' agenda .
how the ratification process is to go on and in which direction the eu should develop is a matter for the heads of state to resolve at their summit later this week . confirming expansion plans in luxembourg , the foreign ministers want to reconfirm the assurances that have already been given for the next round of expansion .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 opinion : fighting poverty needs more than debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slashing of debts is hoped to contribute towards reducing poverty even as g8 finance ministers celebrate their pivotal decision to write off the debts of the world 's poorest countries , deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer writes that the move alone is n't enough to combat poverty . " a historic decision , " the " biggest debt relief program that the world has ever seen " and " a success for the world " : finance ministers of the world 's leading industrialized nations and russia -lrb- g8 -rrb- were reaching for superlatives after saturday 's decision to write off debts of 38 countries in africa and latin america , amounting to a whopping $ 55 billion . eighteen countries will immediately have their debt burdens cancelled , while 20 more are expected to profit from it later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , addresses global business leaders at downing street , london , thursday june 9 , 2005 , ahead of the g8 summit .
the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .
after all , debt relief does create new life opportunities if it 's supported by the political elite - in africa that is the case in countries such as mali , benin , senegal and particularly mozambique , a showcase nation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children from the gambia write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia .
elsewhere , such as in uganda , four million more children go to school today thanks to prior initiatives to reduce debt ; 31,000 new classrooms and 18,000 new teachers are in place in tanzania and half a million children have been vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria in mozambique . new demands on struggling european nations despite those staggering statistics , it all seems like a mere drop in the ocean when one takes a look at the huge goals that the united nations set itself in its jubilee year in 2000 , such as halving world poverty .
the un also wants to accelerate the education and development chances of the world 's poorest by 2015 in spite of continuing population growth . that means the goal has actually grown larger ever since it was declared - and the current g8 decision also shows that world politics has set itself an ambitious and tight deadline despite floundering economic conditions in a row of rich donor nations .
whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .
today , that share hovers at around 0.4 percent among european states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transfair seal on bananas but , most importantly - and this is where the key for the reduction of poverty lies - permanent development can only arise when the poorest countries also have access to the world 's markets and when tea , coffee , cotton , sugar or corn can be sold worldwide without duties and other trade barriers .
skeptics go as far as to suggest that if the current round of doha talks at the world trade organization fail to achieve a real opening of the markets , then the millennium goals of the un are doomed . so far , the millennium goals have helped to make it clear that battling poverty is a responsibility for all fields of politics , they 've also managed to attract public interest in the topic , which slipped too often off the agenda of international institutions . even the g8 finance ministers know too well : fighting poverty counts just as much as drafting security measures and is thus not just a policy for the poor but also an important political goal for the donor nations . ute schaeffer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 scrap debt of poorest nations the finance ministers of the world 's eight wealthiest nations agreed saturday on a deal for immediate 100 percent multilateral debt relief totaling $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- for 18 of the world 's poorest countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany germany -pipe- 13.06.2005 private universities take hold in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american-style graduation at international university bremen while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way . choosing the private , tuition-funded international university in germany was n't a difficult choice to make for frank strzelczyk .
at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .

the un also wants to accelerate the education and development chances of the world 's poorest by 2015 in spite of continuing population growth . that means the goal has actually grown larger ever since it was declared - and the current g8 decision also shows that world politics has set itself an ambitious and tight deadline despite floundering economic conditions in a row of rich donor nations .
whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .

eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks . the current president of the eu , luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , attempted to create some movement on the thorny budget issue with a series of confidential one-on-one talks with eu heads of state prior to foreign ministers ' meeting .
but diplomats from luxembourg are n't counting on any concrete results until after their last bilateral meeting with british prime minister tony blair on tuesday . only if britain were to forgo its multi-billion euro eu budget rebate will there be agreement by the end of this week 's general eu summit on the eu budgetary framework for the period 2007-2013 . british rebate for more than 20 years now , britain has been granted a rebate on its eu contributions that currently totals 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.63 billion -rrb- annually .
the remaining 24 member states at least want to achieve a freeze on the rebate , which was granted to britain 21 years ago when the island nation was among the poorer states in the union .
although its situation has fundamentally changed , the british government has rejected every attempt to renegotiate , something tony blair stressed again last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair " the uk rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away .
period , " blair said before parliament . other net contributors germany , the netherlands and sweden are also demanding a sort of rebate , arguing that on a per capita basis , their payments into brussels ' coffers are too high .
germany contributes between six and seven billion euros a year . italy and portugal have rejected the planned cuts to regional subsidies included in the negotiation package .
italian foreign minister gianfranco fini warned earlier that italy would not hesitate to use a veto on the budget proposal . the nine member states in eastern europe are demanding more financial support , and france is refusing to budge on the issue of agricultural payments , from which it benefits the most .
germany and the five other net contributors officially support capping the budget at one percent of the eu 's gross national income , although it 's on this point that a compromise would be most likely . " masterstroke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu budget debate : a tangled web of issues it would be a masterstroke by juncker were he to succeed in unravelling this complex knot of budget issues , say eu diplomats in brussels . following the negative constitutional referendums , the netherlands and france have barely any room to manoeuvre .
german chancellor gerhard schröder is widely seen as a lame duck and will most likely not get drawn into any wide-reaching obligations .
juncker is of the opinion that the heads of state need to prove their willingness to act with a budget compromise , now that the eu constitution has been put on ice . the constitutional crisis is not officially on the eu foreign ministers ' agenda .
how the ratification process is to go on and in which direction the eu should develop is a matter for the heads of state to resolve at their summit later this week . confirming expansion plans in luxembourg , the foreign ministers want to reconfirm the assurances that have already been given for the next round of expansion .

but there are efforts afoot to create a more peaceful picture . a recent competition run by the bertelsmann foundation and the german interior ministry invited more than one hundred communities to take part in a competition called " immigrant integration - strategies for local integration policies . " in the category of medium-sized towns , first prize went to north rhine-westphalia 's solingen , where young people in particular have been involved in a number of projects aimed at encouraging the integration of refugees and foreigners . overcoming the past solingen 's fairly modest population of 163,000 people draws from 130 different countries , lending the city a colorful , melting pot feel which is not altogether characteristic of germany .
this image of cross cultural harmony can be attributed , at least in part , to the concerted efforts of the town authorities to consign its bad reputation to the annals of time . back in 1993 , solingen hit the headlines when right wing extremists set fire to the house of a turkish family , claiming five lives .
it was enough to spur the townspeople into action , and they quickly set up a number of projects designed at preventing the city from being forever dubbed a hub of xenophobic activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house in solingen in which five people died in 1993 one particularly successful project is a soccer tournament called " cup without borders , " which julia reithmeier of the youth city council , says is for kids who play football on the streets . " young people , and especially refugee children rarely get the opportunity to join a soccer club , which means they end up playing on the streets .
we organised this tournament in order to give such teams the chance to get a taste of success , " she said . active minors solingen also has a very active youth city council , which is made up of german and foreign youths who are elected by school children from the town .
they work closely with the official city council , offering opportunities for meeting new people and getting out of the rut of aimless hanging out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solingen became active after the 1993 arson attack the young council also masterminded a project for promoting tolerance and civil courage , and awards a " silver shoe " for people who stand up to racial hatred in public . in the name of the project school children raised funds for social events in order to give refugee kids the chance to mingle with the more established inhabitants of solingen , and additionally , to finance a homework program for those who are struggling at school . julia reithmeier believes that such programs do n't only benefit refugee children , but also those who are involved in their organisation .

the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market . in eyeing hypovereinsbank for a possible takeover , unicredito 's board must have been looking past the bavarian bank 's 2 billion euros in losses last year and lower revenues .
they must have been looking east . following the takeover of the bank of austria in 2000 , hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , itself the product merger of bavarian banks in 1998 , became sole leader in the new europe .
with unicredit banca as its new parent in a stock swap valued at 15.1 billion euros , the new bank will stretch from the baltics down to macedonia and ukraine .
dominating the east " we are creating the first truly european bank , " said hvb chief executive dieter rampl on sunday . combined , germany 's number two bank and italy 's number one will reach 28 million customers in 19 european countries .
the synergies resulting out of the deal will generate 985 million euros in pre-tax revenue annually , according to reports .
unicredit will also get hvb 's eastern european assets , totalling an estimated 20 billion euros .
after the fusion the two banks will be twice as large in the former eastern bloc as their nearest competitor . eastern europe " is the main goal , " in the takeover , said analyst robert fürchtl , of hauck & aufhäuser .
german workers safe - for now but profits in the east will come at a price .
up to 9,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the merger , say analysts and union representatives .
unicredit will also take on hvb 's debt-laden real estate sector .
analysts wrote ahead of the fusion that unicredit ceo alessandro profumo would have his work cut out for him . bildunterschrift : " the most important question is whether unicredito can improve hvb in germany , " wrote analysts for citigroup smith barney , according to germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . at the moment , it seems german government officials wo n't have to worry about further bad news regarding the country 's miserable job market .
the job cuts look to take place in eastern europe , leaving the 26,000 employees in germany untouched for now . more to come ? " i think this will pave the way for further consolidation in european banking , " metehan sen , an analyst at sal .
oppenheim , told reuters .
cross-border fusions are a relatively new thing in europe .
the takeover last year of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispano for 12.5 billion euros was the region 's first major fusion .
but others are starting to follow . dutch banking leader abn amro is eager to buy up italy 's banca atoniana popolare veneta , the country 's seventh-largest bank .
at the end of march spain 's bbva completed a 6.4 billion euro takeover of italy 's banca natzionale del livoro . foreign banks have been more hesitant in germany , mainly because the country 's top three - deutsche bank , hvb and commerzbank - have a less than 20 percent share of the consumer market .
a major fusion could change that , prophesized commerzbank ceo klaus peter müller in an interview with germany 's focus magazine in april .
" as soon as a foreign bank snaps up a major -lrb- german -rrb- bank , the offers for others will follow relatively quickly , " müller said .
" the race among foreigners after a comprehensive network in germany will begin . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

but there are efforts afoot to create a more peaceful picture . a recent competition run by the bertelsmann foundation and the german interior ministry invited more than one hundred communities to take part in a competition called " immigrant integration - strategies for local integration policies . " in the category of medium-sized towns , first prize went to north rhine-westphalia 's solingen , where young people in particular have been involved in a number of projects aimed at encouraging the integration of refugees and foreigners . overcoming the past solingen 's fairly modest population of 163,000 people draws from 130 different countries , lending the city a colorful , melting pot feel which is not altogether characteristic of germany .
this image of cross cultural harmony can be attributed , at least in part , to the concerted efforts of the town authorities to consign its bad reputation to the annals of time . back in 1993 , solingen hit the headlines when right wing extremists set fire to the house of a turkish family , claiming five lives .
it was enough to spur the townspeople into action , and they quickly set up a number of projects designed at preventing the city from being forever dubbed a hub of xenophobic activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house in solingen in which five people died in 1993 one particularly successful project is a soccer tournament called " cup without borders , " which julia reithmeier of the youth city council , says is for kids who play football on the streets . " young people , and especially refugee children rarely get the opportunity to join a soccer club , which means they end up playing on the streets .
we organised this tournament in order to give such teams the chance to get a taste of success , " she said . active minors solingen also has a very active youth city council , which is made up of german and foreign youths who are elected by school children from the town .
they work closely with the official city council , offering opportunities for meeting new people and getting out of the rut of aimless hanging out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solingen became active after the 1993 arson attack the young council also masterminded a project for promoting tolerance and civil courage , and awards a " silver shoe " for people who stand up to racial hatred in public . in the name of the project school children raised funds for social events in order to give refugee kids the chance to mingle with the more established inhabitants of solingen , and additionally , to finance a homework program for those who are struggling at school . julia reithmeier believes that such programs do n't only benefit refugee children , but also those who are involved in their organisation .

eu foreign ministers are meeting monday to discuss the future spending of the eu .
despite expectations of reaching a compromise on the issue , positions hardened in the run-up to the talks . the current president of the eu , luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , attempted to create some movement on the thorny budget issue with a series of confidential one-on-one talks with eu heads of state prior to foreign ministers ' meeting .
but diplomats from luxembourg are n't counting on any concrete results until after their last bilateral meeting with british prime minister tony blair on tuesday . only if britain were to forgo its multi-billion euro eu budget rebate will there be agreement by the end of this week 's general eu summit on the eu budgetary framework for the period 2007-2013 . british rebate for more than 20 years now , britain has been granted a rebate on its eu contributions that currently totals 4.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.63 billion -rrb- annually .
the remaining 24 member states at least want to achieve a freeze on the rebate , which was granted to britain 21 years ago when the island nation was among the poorer states in the union .
although its situation has fundamentally changed , the british government has rejected every attempt to renegotiate , something tony blair stressed again last week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair " the uk rebate will remain and we will not negotiate it away .
period , " blair said before parliament . other net contributors germany , the netherlands and sweden are also demanding a sort of rebate , arguing that on a per capita basis , their payments into brussels ' coffers are too high .
germany contributes between six and seven billion euros a year . italy and portugal have rejected the planned cuts to regional subsidies included in the negotiation package .
italian foreign minister gianfranco fini warned earlier that italy would not hesitate to use a veto on the budget proposal . the nine member states in eastern europe are demanding more financial support , and france is refusing to budge on the issue of agricultural payments , from which it benefits the most .
germany and the five other net contributors officially support capping the budget at one percent of the eu 's gross national income , although it 's on this point that a compromise would be most likely . " masterstroke " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu budget debate : a tangled web of issues it would be a masterstroke by juncker were he to succeed in unravelling this complex knot of budget issues , say eu diplomats in brussels . following the negative constitutional referendums , the netherlands and france have barely any room to manoeuvre .
german chancellor gerhard schröder is widely seen as a lame duck and will most likely not get drawn into any wide-reaching obligations .
juncker is of the opinion that the heads of state need to prove their willingness to act with a budget compromise , now that the eu constitution has been put on ice . the constitutional crisis is not officially on the eu foreign ministers ' agenda .
how the ratification process is to go on and in which direction the eu should develop is a matter for the heads of state to resolve at their summit later this week . confirming expansion plans in luxembourg , the foreign ministers want to reconfirm the assurances that have already been given for the next round of expansion .
romania and bulgaria are due to be taken into the fold on jan .
1 , 2007 , if they have completed all the required reforms .
the beginning of accession talks with turkey on oct .
3 will be reaffirmed .
a date for beginning talks with croatia is not yet in sight due to unsatisfactory cooperation from zagreb with the war crimes tribunal in the hague . the eu continues to hold onto the goal of allowing the remaining balkan nations - macedonia , bosnia-herzegovina , albania and serbia-montenegro - into the club , despite the fact that there is no foreseeable agreement on a constitutional framework for an eu of 30 or more members . bernd riegert -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , britain clash over eu budget gerhard schröder has said germany is willing to compromise on the eu budget , but britain is sticking to its guns , claiming it will use a veto if need be to retain its discounted payments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 opinion : fighting poverty needs more than debt relief großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slashing of debts is hoped to contribute towards reducing poverty even as g8 finance ministers celebrate their pivotal decision to write off the debts of the world 's poorest countries , deutsche welle 's ute schaeffer writes that the move alone is n't enough to combat poverty . " a historic decision , " the " biggest debt relief program that the world has ever seen " and " a success for the world " : finance ministers of the world 's leading industrialized nations and russia -lrb- g8 -rrb- were reaching for superlatives after saturday 's decision to write off debts of 38 countries in africa and latin america , amounting to a whopping $ 55 billion . eighteen countries will immediately have their debt burdens cancelled , while 20 more are expected to profit from it later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , addresses global business leaders at downing street , london , thursday june 9 , 2005 , ahead of the g8 summit .
the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .
after all , debt relief does create new life opportunities if it 's supported by the political elite - in africa that is the case in countries such as mali , benin , senegal and particularly mozambique , a showcase nation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children from the gambia write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia .
elsewhere , such as in uganda , four million more children go to school today thanks to prior initiatives to reduce debt ; 31,000 new classrooms and 18,000 new teachers are in place in tanzania and half a million children have been vaccinated against tetanus and diphtheria in mozambique . new demands on struggling european nations despite those staggering statistics , it all seems like a mere drop in the ocean when one takes a look at the huge goals that the united nations set itself in its jubilee year in 2000 , such as halving world poverty .
the un also wants to accelerate the education and development chances of the world 's poorest by 2015 in spite of continuing population growth . that means the goal has actually grown larger ever since it was declared - and the current g8 decision also shows that world politics has set itself an ambitious and tight deadline despite floundering economic conditions in a row of rich donor nations .
whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .
today , that share hovers at around 0.4 percent among european states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the transfair seal on bananas but , most importantly - and this is where the key for the reduction of poverty lies - permanent development can only arise when the poorest countries also have access to the world 's markets and when tea , coffee , cotton , sugar or corn can be sold worldwide without duties and other trade barriers .
skeptics go as far as to suggest that if the current round of doha talks at the world trade organization fail to achieve a real opening of the markets , then the millennium goals of the un are doomed . so far , the millennium goals have helped to make it clear that battling poverty is a responsibility for all fields of politics , they 've also managed to attract public interest in the topic , which slipped too often off the agenda of international institutions . even the g8 finance ministers know too well : fighting poverty counts just as much as drafting security measures and is thus not just a policy for the poor but also an important political goal for the donor nations . ute schaeffer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 scrap debt of poorest nations the finance ministers of the world 's eight wealthiest nations agreed saturday on a deal for immediate 100 percent multilateral debt relief totaling $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- for 18 of the world 's poorest countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 13.06.2005 a bank merger with the east in mind großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smiling so far : unicredit 's profumo , left , and hvb 's rampl the merger of germany 's hypovereinsbank with italy 's unicredit over the weekend marks the biggest takeover in european history .
the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market . in eyeing hypovereinsbank for a possible takeover , unicredito 's board must have been looking past the bavarian bank 's 2 billion euros in losses last year and lower revenues .
they must have been looking east . following the takeover of the bank of austria in 2000 , hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , itself the product merger of bavarian banks in 1998 , became sole leader in the new europe .
with unicredit banca as its new parent in a stock swap valued at 15.1 billion euros , the new bank will stretch from the baltics down to macedonia and ukraine .
dominating the east " we are creating the first truly european bank , " said hvb chief executive dieter rampl on sunday . combined , germany 's number two bank and italy 's number one will reach 28 million customers in 19 european countries .
the synergies resulting out of the deal will generate 985 million euros in pre-tax revenue annually , according to reports .
unicredit will also get hvb 's eastern european assets , totalling an estimated 20 billion euros .
after the fusion the two banks will be twice as large in the former eastern bloc as their nearest competitor . eastern europe " is the main goal , " in the takeover , said analyst robert fürchtl , of hauck & aufhäuser .
german workers safe - for now but profits in the east will come at a price .
up to 9,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the merger , say analysts and union representatives .
unicredit will also take on hvb 's debt-laden real estate sector .
analysts wrote ahead of the fusion that unicredit ceo alessandro profumo would have his work cut out for him . bildunterschrift : " the most important question is whether unicredito can improve hvb in germany , " wrote analysts for citigroup smith barney , according to germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . at the moment , it seems german government officials wo n't have to worry about further bad news regarding the country 's miserable job market .
the job cuts look to take place in eastern europe , leaving the 26,000 employees in germany untouched for now . more to come ? " i think this will pave the way for further consolidation in european banking , " metehan sen , an analyst at sal .
oppenheim , told reuters .
cross-border fusions are a relatively new thing in europe .
the takeover last year of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispano for 12.5 billion euros was the region 's first major fusion .
but others are starting to follow . dutch banking leader abn amro is eager to buy up italy 's banca atoniana popolare veneta , the country 's seventh-largest bank .
at the end of march spain 's bbva completed a 6.4 billion euro takeover of italy 's banca natzionale del livoro . foreign banks have been more hesitant in germany , mainly because the country 's top three - deutsche bank , hvb and commerzbank - have a less than 20 percent share of the consumer market .
a major fusion could change that , prophesized commerzbank ceo klaus peter müller in an interview with germany 's focus magazine in april .
" as soon as a foreign bank snaps up a major -lrb- german -rrb- bank , the offers for others will follow relatively quickly , " müller said .
" the race among foreigners after a comprehensive network in germany will begin . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .
unicredito plans to offer more than 15 billion euros -lrb- $ 18 billion -rrb- in a stock swap in the biggest cross-border banking merger in europe .
-lrb- june 11 , 2005 -rrb- bank buyout could spur european mergers the purchase of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispana could herald the beginning of long-awaited consolidation in the european banking sector .
but the german market remains troubled .

the fusion thrusts the bank into the lead position in the growing eastern european market . in eyeing hypovereinsbank for a possible takeover , unicredito 's board must have been looking past the bavarian bank 's 2 billion euros in losses last year and lower revenues .
they must have been looking east . following the takeover of the bank of austria in 2000 , hypovereinsbank -lrb- hvb -rrb- , itself the product merger of bavarian banks in 1998 , became sole leader in the new europe .
with unicredit banca as its new parent in a stock swap valued at 15.1 billion euros , the new bank will stretch from the baltics down to macedonia and ukraine .
dominating the east " we are creating the first truly european bank , " said hvb chief executive dieter rampl on sunday . combined , germany 's number two bank and italy 's number one will reach 28 million customers in 19 european countries .
the synergies resulting out of the deal will generate 985 million euros in pre-tax revenue annually , according to reports .
unicredit will also get hvb 's eastern european assets , totalling an estimated 20 billion euros .
after the fusion the two banks will be twice as large in the former eastern bloc as their nearest competitor . eastern europe " is the main goal , " in the takeover , said analyst robert fürchtl , of hauck & aufhäuser .
german workers safe - for now but profits in the east will come at a price .
up to 9,000 jobs will be lost as a result of the merger , say analysts and union representatives .
unicredit will also take on hvb 's debt-laden real estate sector .
analysts wrote ahead of the fusion that unicredit ceo alessandro profumo would have his work cut out for him . bildunterschrift : " the most important question is whether unicredito can improve hvb in germany , " wrote analysts for citigroup smith barney , according to germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . at the moment , it seems german government officials wo n't have to worry about further bad news regarding the country 's miserable job market .
the job cuts look to take place in eastern europe , leaving the 26,000 employees in germany untouched for now . more to come ? " i think this will pave the way for further consolidation in european banking , " metehan sen , an analyst at sal .
oppenheim , told reuters .
cross-border fusions are a relatively new thing in europe .
the takeover last year of britain 's abbey national by spain 's santander central hispano for 12.5 billion euros was the region 's first major fusion .
but others are starting to follow . dutch banking leader abn amro is eager to buy up italy 's banca atoniana popolare veneta , the country 's seventh-largest bank .
at the end of march spain 's bbva completed a 6.4 billion euro takeover of italy 's banca natzionale del livoro . foreign banks have been more hesitant in germany , mainly because the country 's top three - deutsche bank , hvb and commerzbank - have a less than 20 percent share of the consumer market .
a major fusion could change that , prophesized commerzbank ceo klaus peter müller in an interview with germany 's focus magazine in april .
" as soon as a foreign bank snaps up a major -lrb- german -rrb- bank , the offers for others will follow relatively quickly , " müller said .
" the race among foreigners after a comprehensive network in germany will begin . " dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de unicredito swallows hvb supervisory boards of hypovereinsbank and unicredito agreed to a takeover sunday .

but there are efforts afoot to create a more peaceful picture . a recent competition run by the bertelsmann foundation and the german interior ministry invited more than one hundred communities to take part in a competition called " immigrant integration - strategies for local integration policies . " in the category of medium-sized towns , first prize went to north rhine-westphalia 's solingen , where young people in particular have been involved in a number of projects aimed at encouraging the integration of refugees and foreigners . overcoming the past solingen 's fairly modest population of 163,000 people draws from 130 different countries , lending the city a colorful , melting pot feel which is not altogether characteristic of germany .
this image of cross cultural harmony can be attributed , at least in part , to the concerted efforts of the town authorities to consign its bad reputation to the annals of time . back in 1993 , solingen hit the headlines when right wing extremists set fire to the house of a turkish family , claiming five lives .
it was enough to spur the townspeople into action , and they quickly set up a number of projects designed at preventing the city from being forever dubbed a hub of xenophobic activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house in solingen in which five people died in 1993 one particularly successful project is a soccer tournament called " cup without borders , " which julia reithmeier of the youth city council , says is for kids who play football on the streets . " young people , and especially refugee children rarely get the opportunity to join a soccer club , which means they end up playing on the streets .
we organised this tournament in order to give such teams the chance to get a taste of success , " she said . active minors solingen also has a very active youth city council , which is made up of german and foreign youths who are elected by school children from the town .
they work closely with the official city council , offering opportunities for meeting new people and getting out of the rut of aimless hanging out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solingen became active after the 1993 arson attack the young council also masterminded a project for promoting tolerance and civil courage , and awards a " silver shoe " for people who stand up to racial hatred in public . in the name of the project school children raised funds for social events in order to give refugee kids the chance to mingle with the more established inhabitants of solingen , and additionally , to finance a homework program for those who are struggling at school . julia reithmeier believes that such programs do n't only benefit refugee children , but also those who are involved in their organisation .
" through this kind of work , they can learn to deal with problems , to address serious issues and develop a sense of responsibility .

" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .

they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .

a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .

they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook .

they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .

following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s .

italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany germany -pipe- 13.06.2005 private universities take hold in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american-style graduation at international university bremen while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way . choosing the private , tuition-funded international university in germany was n't a difficult choice to make for frank strzelczyk .
at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .
-lrb- june 6 , 2005 -rrb- are german universities losing their luster ?

" a historic decision , " the " biggest debt relief program that the world has ever seen " and " a success for the world " : finance ministers of the world 's leading industrialized nations and russia -lrb- g8 -rrb- were reaching for superlatives after saturday 's decision to write off debts of 38 countries in africa and latin america , amounting to a whopping $ 55 billion . eighteen countries will immediately have their debt burdens cancelled , while 20 more are expected to profit from it later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , addresses global business leaders at downing street , london , thursday june 9 , 2005 , ahead of the g8 summit .
the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .

" a historic decision , " the " biggest debt relief program that the world has ever seen " and " a success for the world " : finance ministers of the world 's leading industrialized nations and russia -lrb- g8 -rrb- were reaching for superlatives after saturday 's decision to write off debts of 38 countries in africa and latin america , amounting to a whopping $ 55 billion . eighteen countries will immediately have their debt burdens cancelled , while 20 more are expected to profit from it later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , addresses global business leaders at downing street , london , thursday june 9 , 2005 , ahead of the g8 summit .
the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .

this image of cross cultural harmony can be attributed , at least in part , to the concerted efforts of the town authorities to consign its bad reputation to the annals of time . back in 1993 , solingen hit the headlines when right wing extremists set fire to the house of a turkish family , claiming five lives .

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 italy rejects easing assisted fertility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters reminding italians to vote , failed to have much impact a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot . there was no escaping the mood of election apathy on monday , when voters merely trickled into polling stations to have their say on the issue of whether or not italy is ready to embrace a change in its bioethics law . only around a quarter of italian voters turned out to have their say in the referendum .
following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s . " te deum " praise of thanks although top prelates and the vatican kept a low profile as the voting continued , father gianni baget bozzo , a priest linked to prime minister silvio berlusconi , said he was preparing a " te deum " hymn of thanksgiving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infuriated and embittered supporters of change accused the church of outstepping its sphere . " those who are sensitive to the influence of the pope let themselves be conditioned and gave up their right to free choice , " lamented michele fasanella , an arts student from the southern italian city of potenza . " there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s . " te deum " praise of thanks although top prelates and the vatican kept a low profile as the voting continued , father gianni baget bozzo , a priest linked to prime minister silvio berlusconi , said he was preparing a " te deum " hymn of thanksgiving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infuriated and embittered supporters of change accused the church of outstepping its sphere . " those who are sensitive to the influence of the pope let themselves be conditioned and gave up their right to free choice , " lamented michele fasanella , an arts student from the southern italian city of potenza . " there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany germany -pipe- 13.06.2005 private universities take hold in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american-style graduation at international university bremen while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way . choosing the private , tuition-funded international university in germany was n't a difficult choice to make for frank strzelczyk .
at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .
-lrb- june 6 , 2005 -rrb- are german universities losing their luster ?
chancellor schröder wants to reform the education system this year and the media is awash with talk of “ elite universities . ”

each group would be composed of three to five arbitrators . the united states is asking the world trade organization to rule against subsidies paid by european governments to airbus .

each side may then request a new meeting within 10 days .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.06.2005 italy rejects easing assisted fertility großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : posters reminding italians to vote , failed to have much impact a boycott call spearheaded by the roman catholic church has trounced an attempt to relax italy 's stringent fertility and bioethics law , after voter turnout failed to reach the 50 percent needed to validate the ballot . there was no escaping the mood of election apathy on monday , when voters merely trickled into polling stations to have their say on the issue of whether or not italy is ready to embrace a change in its bioethics law . only around a quarter of italian voters turned out to have their say in the referendum .
following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s . " te deum " praise of thanks although top prelates and the vatican kept a low profile as the voting continued , father gianni baget bozzo , a priest linked to prime minister silvio berlusconi , said he was preparing a " te deum " hymn of thanksgiving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infuriated and embittered supporters of change accused the church of outstepping its sphere . " those who are sensitive to the influence of the pope let themselves be conditioned and gave up their right to free choice , " lamented michele fasanella , an arts student from the southern italian city of potenza . " there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s .

italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

but there are efforts afoot to create a more peaceful picture . a recent competition run by the bertelsmann foundation and the german interior ministry invited more than one hundred communities to take part in a competition called " immigrant integration - strategies for local integration policies . " in the category of medium-sized towns , first prize went to north rhine-westphalia 's solingen , where young people in particular have been involved in a number of projects aimed at encouraging the integration of refugees and foreigners . overcoming the past solingen 's fairly modest population of 163,000 people draws from 130 different countries , lending the city a colorful , melting pot feel which is not altogether characteristic of germany .
this image of cross cultural harmony can be attributed , at least in part , to the concerted efforts of the town authorities to consign its bad reputation to the annals of time . back in 1993 , solingen hit the headlines when right wing extremists set fire to the house of a turkish family , claiming five lives .

the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .

the un also wants to accelerate the education and development chances of the world 's poorest by 2015 in spite of continuing population growth . that means the goal has actually grown larger ever since it was declared - and the current g8 decision also shows that world politics has set itself an ambitious and tight deadline despite floundering economic conditions in a row of rich donor nations .
whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : focus on education tuition fees face uphill battle in germany jewish , muslim groups blast minister 's children 's initiative study : universities in eastern germany are top-notch concerns about scientology youth tutoring centers in germany germany -pipe- 13.06.2005 private universities take hold in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an american-style graduation at international university bremen while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way . choosing the private , tuition-funded international university in germany was n't a difficult choice to make for frank strzelczyk .
at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : students demonstrating against tuition fees at german public universities another downside is the tuition .
all the private universities are non-profit and say that they offer grants to those who ca n't afford the fees .
but in germany , where most students study for free , the idea of paying tuition is still controversial , particularly in a country where parents pay high taxes in exchange for such services as education . a beacon for others ? still , education experts are applauding the experiment and believe more will arise . " it 's a very recent phenomena and a very interesting one , " said jürgen enders of the consortium of higher education researchers , an international association founded at the university of kassel .
" to what extent they will be successful or have an impact on the traditional system is hard to say yet .
but even if they do n't turn out to be very successful , it was important that they began and provided this innovative kick . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will private colleges help to make classes at public universities smaller ?
enders also added that such new projects can provide a good example for public universitites . that is what springer and his counterparts at the new international universities hope as well . " we are a beacon for this country 's education institutions , " he said .
" they look to us but ca n't emulate us yet .
and even if we do n't survive , we will have shown what is possible .
german universities will be better because of us - and they will have to . " jabeen bhatti send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

following sunday 's poor result , which saw just 18.7 percent casting ballots , monday 's papers wrote as if it were a foregone conclusion that the referendum would fail . " few vote , referendum drowns , " headlined the corriere della sera daily .
analysts pointed at voter apathy but also at the appeal of italian cardinals who , backed by newly-elected pope benedict xvi , urged predominantly roman catholic italians to abstain from voting on moral grounds . " the church exults , " wrote orazio petrosillo , vatican expert in il messaggero , while turin 's la stampa daily said " catholics could return the slap in the face they received by the abortion and divorce law , " approved in referendums despite church opposition in the 1970s . " te deum " praise of thanks although top prelates and the vatican kept a low profile as the voting continued , father gianni baget bozzo , a priest linked to prime minister silvio berlusconi , said he was preparing a " te deum " hymn of thanksgiving . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infuriated and embittered supporters of change accused the church of outstepping its sphere . " those who are sensitive to the influence of the pope let themselves be conditioned and gave up their right to free choice , " lamented michele fasanella , an arts student from the southern italian city of potenza . " there was such a brainwashing campaign by the church with the elderly , even the pope spoke out , so the result could n't have been any different , " said renato , a roman typographer , who voted to loosen the 2004 law along with 14 of his relatives on sunday . general apathy but the result was also due to the " indifference and laziness of those who do not vote regardless of the issue at stake , " said political analyst giulio anselmi .
none of the five referendums of the past decade succeeded in reaching the quorum . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaving a polling station in downtown rome equal opportunities minister stefania prestagiacomo refused to give up hope early monday , saying that there was still a chance for the quorum to be reached . if not , italy will have to " keep a backward law , that jeopardizes the health of women , " the minister was quoted as saying in corriere della sera .
" good luck to us ! " quipped the minister , who spearheaded the campaign for change . vow to continue lawmakers backing change said they would not give up and would try to modify the law in parliament .
italy was deeply divided over the referendum , which asked people to authorize medical research on embryos , scrap a reference to the embryo as a full human being and give people with hereditary diseases access to medically-assisted procreation , currently permitted only to sterile couples . the referendum also asked voters whether to abolish current restrictions which only allow couples to create three embryos that must all be implanted at the same time , and without checking whether they carry genetic diseases . opponents say the proposed changes go against what the pope has called the " inviolability of human life from conception , " while supporters say the current law puts women 's health in danger , risks leaving italy in the dark ages of medical research , and could lead to a recriminalization of abortion . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de swiss approve stem cell research in a referendum on sunday , swiss voters overwhelmingly approved a law that allows medical research on stem cells taken from human embryos but bars cloning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 13.06.2005 -pipe- 11:00 utc german leftists forge anti-schröder alliance a new left-wing german party decided sunday to form an electoral alliance with the former east german communists , the party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , a development that could threaten the ruling social democrats in upcoming polls .
" an overwhelming majority is for the alliance , " declared sabine lösing , one of the leaders of the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- , which was founded in january by politicians who split from chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic party .

" a historic decision , " the " biggest debt relief program that the world has ever seen " and " a success for the world " : finance ministers of the world 's leading industrialized nations and russia -lrb- g8 -rrb- were reaching for superlatives after saturday 's decision to write off debts of 38 countries in africa and latin america , amounting to a whopping $ 55 billion . eighteen countries will immediately have their debt burdens cancelled , while 20 more are expected to profit from it later . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's prime minister tony blair , left , addresses global business leaders at downing street , london , thursday june 9 , 2005 , ahead of the g8 summit .
the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .
after all , debt relief does create new life opportunities if it 's supported by the political elite - in africa that is the case in countries such as mali , benin , senegal and particularly mozambique , a showcase nation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : orphaned children from the gambia write on a blackboard in a school at the sos childrens village in bakoteh , gambia .

the un also wants to accelerate the education and development chances of the world 's poorest by 2015 in spite of continuing population growth . that means the goal has actually grown larger ever since it was declared - and the current g8 decision also shows that world politics has set itself an ambitious and tight deadline despite floundering economic conditions in a row of rich donor nations .
whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .

skeptics go as far as to suggest that if the current round of doha talks at the world trade organization fail to achieve a real opening of the markets , then the millennium goals of the un are doomed . so far , the millennium goals have helped to make it clear that battling poverty is a responsibility for all fields of politics , they 've also managed to attract public interest in the topic , which slipped too often off the agenda of international institutions . even the g8 finance ministers know too well : fighting poverty counts just as much as drafting security measures and is thus not just a policy for the poor but also an important political goal for the donor nations . ute schaeffer -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 scrap debt of poorest nations the finance ministers of the world 's eight wealthiest nations agreed saturday on a deal for immediate 100 percent multilateral debt relief totaling $ 40 billion -lrb- 33 billion euros -rrb- for 18 of the world 's poorest countries .

the decision is a show of strength for the g8 and yet it can at best be only a small step to achieve the millennium development goals .
at the same time , tony blair and the british presidency of the g8 have managed to defy the doomsayers and get the first part of their ambitious " marshall plan for africa " on the road : canceling out debts for the world 's most impoverished countries . the right countries promoted it is good and right that among the countries that are set to profit from the debt relief program are those who have stood out in past years for good governance and whose leaders ensured that development aid and debt relief have directly reached their people . they invested in infrastructure and education and made efforts to improve the health situation in their countries and thus raised the living standards of their citizens .

whether it 's france or germany - european economies are , first and foremost , battling their own weaknesses .
in the face of dwindling finances , it 's domestic politics and social problems that set the agenda and influence public opinion in these countries . the recent g8 decision means that these countries will definitely face new demands in the coming years : germany will be expected to shell out up to € 150 million in the next three years and up to € 950 million in the next ten . although it will put a strain on the economy , it was a decision the german finance minister probably agreed to because it 's unlikely that he will have to finance the implementation of the g8 goal after the snap federal election in germany in september given that the ruling coalition looks set to lose to the conservative opposition . need to go beyond debt relief but , debt relief is n't all when it comes to combating poverty .
the recently declared marshall plan for africa goes much beyond that - it foresees a sharp increase in development aid up to 0.7 percent of gdp of the industrialized nations .

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .
the state government of bremen supported the initiative , hoping for it to be a thorn to the public bremen institution , which suffers from a poor reputation . in 1999 , the university admitted the first students , at a cost of 15,000 euros tuition annually .
they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .
but that skepticism is going away with awareness and in five years , such degrees will be common as they are required to be .

at 22 , he felt he was too old to go to a traditional german university . " i wanted to make up time , " he said .
" i knew that there , i would have a degree in three years .
it takes much longer in a german university . " strzelczyk graduated from the school with a bachelor 's degree in information technology in 2002 .
he now works as a developer for an international software company and is one of a growing number of germans who choose to opt out of the german academic system .
while some people go abroad for internationally-recognized degrees , others are seeking out the limited but growing opportunities at home . reform comes slowly the mediocre reputation of many german universities is partially to blame for this .
when a survey in the times higher educational supplement ranked the best 200 international universities last year , only heidelberg university made it into the top 50 - at 47th place . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university of heidelberg is ranked 47 out of 200 top universities in the world meanwhile , government proposals to reform public schools are moving slowly .
as politicians still debate the details of increased spending , private universities are already opening their doors and offering something different . in the past few years , universities have sprung up - some are the offspring of us universities , others are collaborations between german officials and academics and partners abroad .
most offer bachelor 's degrees in subjects such as business administration or the sciences , while some offer masters , all in highly structured programs .
all charge fees of several thousand euros per year - a lot when compared to the mainly nominal fees at public german universities . wanting younger graduates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : we want younger graduates , companies say one of the first to offer such degrees was the international university in germany , in bruchsal near heidelberg in southern germany , founded in 1998 .
a small group of professors at nearby universities talked to private business representatives and learned that they would prefer to hire younger , more flexible graduates - germans usually graduate from traditional universities in their late 20s . they also wanted to get out ahead of the bologna declaration of 1999 , in which about 40 european countries committed themselves to adopting the two-tiered system of the anglo-saxon countries as a way to increase the international competitiveness of their higher education systems . they worked with state and federal officials who provided seed money and former barracks and reached out to universities in the us such as the university of california at berkeley and the university of florida .
private corporate sponsorship , federal aid and students fees have made the university financially viable , officials said . not a german institution these days , the university instructs about 100 students , 40 percent of whom are german , in three-year bachelor programs in english that include an internship and a semester abroad and cost 10,000 euros annually .
they aim to increase their student population to 400 in the next few years . " we were started by germans and mostly run administratively by germans , but we are not a german university , " said michael lehmann , who handles recruitment for the university .
" we are truly an international university , with international students and professors and an international outlook . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iub graduates celebrate another private university , the international university bremen -lrb- iub -rrb- , was the brainchild of two mathematics professors , one german and another from rice university in texas .

they continue to run at a deficit but hope that will change and funding comes in from private donors and alumni . " our programs have certain advantages , " said sebastian springer , a professor of biochemistry at the university , who has been at the institution since the beginning .
" students know when they will graduate , learn in small classes , have easy access to their professors , and earn degrees that internationally recognized . " slow acceptance a real question still being answered is how do employers accept these new degrees .
school officials admit that this is still an issue . " we graduate very competitive people and they go to very reputable universities in the us and the uk , " springer of the iub said .
" but some still are asking , ' what is a bachelor 's degree and what can be taught in three years , ' and will still choose someone with a good old traditional german degree .

each group would be composed of three to five arbitrators . the united states is asking the world trade organization to rule against subsidies paid by european governments to airbus .
the europeans are asking the wto to declare us subsidies for boeing to be illegal .
under wto procedures , a party to a dispute challenged by another may oppose the creation of a special arbitration group .
both sides were expected to use this tactic on monday , while also defending their points of view before the wto dispute settlements panel .
each side may then request a new meeting within 10 days .
it will not then be possible to oppose the constitution of a study group . the dispute is regarded as one of the biggest and the most complicated that the wto has ever been asked to handle and could last until 2006 or even for many years . dw-world.de dw-world : airbus a380 six months behind schedule the airbus a380 superjumbo is six months behind its delivery schedule due to production problems , a situation which may have huge financial consequences .

but in germany , help is on the way in the form of an online dating portal . must be : attractive , outgoing , successful , funny . let 's face it , it 's tough enough for singles to find a potential mate on the dating market without having to add to the list " practicing catholic who subscribes to the church 's teachings on love , sex and marriage . " in germany , at least , that 's where the new online dating portal www.kathtreff.org comes in .
catholics interested in marriage - not just a casual flirt - fill out a questionnaire about what they 're looking for in a partner and include some personal details -lrb- favorite saint , typical alcohol consumption , for example -rrb- . with the purchase of a three-month , six-month or year 's membership at a cost of 25 , 40 or 70 euros -lrb- $ 30 , $ 48 or $ 70 -rrb- .
kathtreff 's database of like-minded catholics is open for perusal .
the site was launched in may , and so far , around 300 participants have registered . kathtreff is the brainchild of austrian bishop andreas laun .
the 62-year-old is known for holding very traditional catholic views on sex and marriage .
but he was inspired to take the high-tech road to match-making by a young couple , who told him of how they each longed to find a partner with compatible values . kathtreff cautions the hopeful not to expect too much too fast , and recommends that they continue to try and meet the man or woman for a lifetime outside the virtual world of the internet .
equally important , the site advises , is to accompany the search for a spouse with daily prayer .
miracles , it seems , just do n't happen out of the blue after all . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : germany 's most-eligible bachelor ?

the oldbury nuclear power station is due to close in 2008 " it feels like we are murderers deciding whether to bury the body , " shouted the middle-aged gentleman .
" my concern is that we do n't become serial killers . "
feelings were running high in the packed community room in thornbury , south gloucestershire .
the public had been invited by the committee on radioactive waste management to discuss what the nation should do with the 80,000 cubic metre legacy of more than 60 years of nuclear power .
the subject may have been waste , but for many there was a more important issue : the possibility of more nuclear power stations being built .
i would think hinkley is high on the list of new nuclear power stations professor ian fells nuclear power is an emotive subject , nowhere more so than in the west of england where four power stations are either operating or being decommissioned .
while the industry may be in decline , it still employs around 2,000 people and injects £ 500m into the regional economy .
but with power stations in berkeley , gloucestershire , oldbury , south gloucestershire , and hinkley point , somerset , has come the associated baggage of health scares and safety concerns .
and with reports the government may resurrect the uk 's power station building programme , the issue is once again a hot topic across the region .
of the uk 's 14 operating power stations , all but one will be shut by 2023 .
the nuclear power industry has argued that if britain is to meet its future energy needs and targets for tackling climate change , more power stations are needed .
nuclear power in the west berkeley : opened 1962 .
closed 1989 hinkley a : opened 1965 .
closed 2000 hinkley b : opened 1976 .
due to close 2011 oldbury : opened 1968 .
due to close 2008 the huge start-up costs of building new stations means current sites would probably be preferred if the government decided to build again .
hinkley point has been mooted as a favoured location .
hinkley a , the first power station at the site , closed in 2000 , and hinkley b is due to shut in 2011 .
planning permission for a third station was granted in 1990 , but the government chose not to proceed .
although , planning permission has now lapsed , many in the industry believe hinkley remains a prime location .
" i would think hinkley is high on the list of new nuclear power stations , " says ian fells , fellow of the royal academy of engineering .
" hinkley has already gone through the planning process and that could be revived , " he added .
professor fells believes berkeley or oldbury could also be considered , although other industry insiders think the sites are not suitable for new power stations .
environmental groups have also highlighted hinkley as a likely target and are focusing on blocking any moves to build another power station .
' risks too great ' somerset-based campaign group stop hinkley claims there is a cancer cluster close to the power station .
spokesman jim duffy said people were more aware of the risks of having a power station on their doorstep than they were when many existing stations were built .
" people are very sophisticated in a way which they were n't in the 1950s , " mr duffy said .
" and they also tend to see ways of -lrb- opposition -rrb- which were n't there in the 1950s and 1960s . "
referring to the chernobyl disaster in 1986 , bristol green party spokesman geoff collard said the risks were too great .
" even if there is a fraction of a per cent chance of a leak , the consequences are so horrendous that we ca n't afford to take the risk , " he said .
but south west-based environmentalist james lovelock believes nuclear power , which produces very little carbon , may hold the key to tackling global warming .
he says radiation emitted from nuclear power stations was less than that which occurs in our natural environment .
he said the opposition to nuclear power was based on " fear and the perception of danger - not reality " .
" everybody was so scared stiff during the cold war that there would be an all-out nuclear war between the superpowers , " dr lovelock said " it was a matter of great concern , it became more extreme and a climate of fear built up .
" we are still paying the price -lrb- for that -rrb- . "

the public had been invited by the committee on radioactive waste management to discuss what the nation should do with the 80,000 cubic metre legacy of more than 60 years of nuclear power .

the nuclear power industry has argued that if britain is to meet its future energy needs and targets for tackling climate change , more power stations are needed .

hinkley point has been mooted as a favoured location .
hinkley a , the first power station at the site , closed in 2000 , and hinkley b is due to shut in 2011 .
planning permission for a third station was granted in 1990 , but the government chose not to proceed .

professor fells believes berkeley or oldbury could also be considered , although other industry insiders think the sites are not suitable for new power stations .
environmental groups have also highlighted hinkley as a likely target and are focusing on blocking any moves to build another power station .
' risks too great ' somerset-based campaign group stop hinkley claims there is a cancer cluster close to the power station .
spokesman jim duffy said people were more aware of the risks of having a power station on their doorstep than they were when many existing stations were built .

instead of releasing windows viruses intermittently , many creators of worms and trojans are pumping them out with increasing frequency .
for a while new variants of one virus , called mytob , were appearing every hour .
some viruses appear in hundreds of different guises .
this tactic is designed to fox security firms that use software to scan e-mail attachments for the signatures of known viruses .
the variants are appearing far faster than firms can analyse them and update their scanners to spot the malicious code .
the tactic seems to be paying off .
currently , mytob variants are filling 14 of the positions in the top 20 threats list collated by security firm sophos .
spot and scan james kay , chief technology officer at mail filtering firm blackspider , said the accelerating number of virus variants highlighted the dangers of simply relying on e-mail scanners to catch viruses .
" if you have lots of viruses to combat and a limited amount of resources , you have to choose which ones you are going to patch , " he said .
this can mean that protection against some viruses , typically ones that appear in small numbers , is unavailable for a long time .
these unnamed viruses can then go on to catch out more people than they would otherwise .
" there 's a connection between the window of exposure and the volume of a virus , " he said .
if anti-virus companies could produce patches within three hours of the first appearance of a virus , outbreaks would almost disappear , suggests research by andreas marx of the independent av-test organisation of the institute of technical and business information systems at the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg .
however , mr marx 's work has found that although response times from anti-virus companies are improving it still takes them , on average , 10 hours to update scanners and produce patches for new malicious programs .
novel threat a study carried out by security firm checkbridge found that , on some days , scanning programs missed more than one-third of e-mail borne viruses .
home users are most at risk from virus variants to gather its statistics checkbridge ran two million e-mail messages sent over five days through three well-known e-mail scanners .
none of the tested programs caught all the viruses .
on the best day the top-performing scanner caught 97 % of the malicious programs in the body of messages .
by contrast on one day only 64 % of the infected messages were spotted by one scanner .
" even using two scanners is not going to catch all the viruses all the time , " said john turley , managing director and founder of checkbridge .
also necessary were programs that use general rules , called heuristics , to spot unknown variants that resemble known viruses .
" heuristics are essential , otherwise it 's just not going to work , " he said .
future versions james key from blackspider said it used scanners , heuristics and programs that can take a broad view of what is happening to a mail server .
if an e-mail server is suddenly struck by thousands of messages bearing the same attachment , it was a fair bet that a virus outbreak was under way , said mr kay .
but graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , said few mail security firms relied solely on scanners to spot and stop viruses getting through to users .
" anti-virus is not just about finding known viruses , " he said .
" we use a heuristic system that will predict what future variants look like . "
he said that companies should also ensure that their e-mail gateways use simple rules , such as refusing messages bearing program files , to help prevent viruses getting through .
most large anti-virus companies were now 24-hour operations that can deal with the 1,000 or so viruses and variants they see every month .
many update their scanning programs hourly to keep up with the evolution of viruses .
while this helps large companies , it can mean home users will be the most likely to be caught out .
" the main people suffering are the home users who have always been more laid back about their security , " said mr cluley .

instead of releasing windows viruses intermittently , many creators of worms and trojans are pumping them out with increasing frequency .
for a while new variants of one virus , called mytob , were appearing every hour .
some viruses appear in hundreds of different guises .
this tactic is designed to fox security firms that use software to scan e-mail attachments for the signatures of known viruses .
the variants are appearing far faster than firms can analyse them and update their scanners to spot the malicious code .
the tactic seems to be paying off .
currently , mytob variants are filling 14 of the positions in the top 20 threats list collated by security firm sophos .
spot and scan james kay , chief technology officer at mail filtering firm blackspider , said the accelerating number of virus variants highlighted the dangers of simply relying on e-mail scanners to catch viruses .
" if you have lots of viruses to combat and a limited amount of resources , you have to choose which ones you are going to patch , " he said .
this can mean that protection against some viruses , typically ones that appear in small numbers , is unavailable for a long time .
these unnamed viruses can then go on to catch out more people than they would otherwise .
" there 's a connection between the window of exposure and the volume of a virus , " he said .
if anti-virus companies could produce patches within three hours of the first appearance of a virus , outbreaks would almost disappear , suggests research by andreas marx of the independent av-test organisation of the institute of technical and business information systems at the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg .
however , mr marx 's work has found that although response times from anti-virus companies are improving it still takes them , on average , 10 hours to update scanners and produce patches for new malicious programs .
novel threat a study carried out by security firm checkbridge found that , on some days , scanning programs missed more than one-third of e-mail borne viruses .
home users are most at risk from virus variants to gather its statistics checkbridge ran two million e-mail messages sent over five days through three well-known e-mail scanners .
none of the tested programs caught all the viruses .
on the best day the top-performing scanner caught 97 % of the malicious programs in the body of messages .
by contrast on one day only 64 % of the infected messages were spotted by one scanner .
" even using two scanners is not going to catch all the viruses all the time , " said john turley , managing director and founder of checkbridge .
also necessary were programs that use general rules , called heuristics , to spot unknown variants that resemble known viruses .
" heuristics are essential , otherwise it 's just not going to work , " he said .
future versions james key from blackspider said it used scanners , heuristics and programs that can take a broad view of what is happening to a mail server .

" we use a heuristic system that will predict what future variants look like . "
he said that companies should also ensure that their e-mail gateways use simple rules , such as refusing messages bearing program files , to help prevent viruses getting through .
most large anti-virus companies were now 24-hour operations that can deal with the 1,000 or so viruses and variants they see every month .
many update their scanning programs hourly to keep up with the evolution of viruses .
while this helps large companies , it can mean home users will be the most likely to be caught out .
" the main people suffering are the home users who have always been more laid back about their security , " said mr cluley .

instead of releasing windows viruses intermittently , many creators of worms and trojans are pumping them out with increasing frequency .
for a while new variants of one virus , called mytob , were appearing every hour .
some viruses appear in hundreds of different guises .
this tactic is designed to fox security firms that use software to scan e-mail attachments for the signatures of known viruses .
the variants are appearing far faster than firms can analyse them and update their scanners to spot the malicious code .
the tactic seems to be paying off .
currently , mytob variants are filling 14 of the positions in the top 20 threats list collated by security firm sophos .
spot and scan james kay , chief technology officer at mail filtering firm blackspider , said the accelerating number of virus variants highlighted the dangers of simply relying on e-mail scanners to catch viruses .
" if you have lots of viruses to combat and a limited amount of resources , you have to choose which ones you are going to patch , " he said .
this can mean that protection against some viruses , typically ones that appear in small numbers , is unavailable for a long time .
these unnamed viruses can then go on to catch out more people than they would otherwise .
" there 's a connection between the window of exposure and the volume of a virus , " he said .
if anti-virus companies could produce patches within three hours of the first appearance of a virus , outbreaks would almost disappear , suggests research by andreas marx of the independent av-test organisation of the institute of technical and business information systems at the otto-von-guericke university in magdeburg .
however , mr marx 's work has found that although response times from anti-virus companies are improving it still takes them , on average , 10 hours to update scanners and produce patches for new malicious programs .
novel threat a study carried out by security firm checkbridge found that , on some days , scanning programs missed more than one-third of e-mail borne viruses .
home users are most at risk from virus variants to gather its statistics checkbridge ran two million e-mail messages sent over five days through three well-known e-mail scanners .
none of the tested programs caught all the viruses .
on the best day the top-performing scanner caught 97 % of the malicious programs in the body of messages .
by contrast on one day only 64 % of the infected messages were spotted by one scanner .
" even using two scanners is not going to catch all the viruses all the time , " said john turley , managing director and founder of checkbridge .
also necessary were programs that use general rules , called heuristics , to spot unknown variants that resemble known viruses .
" heuristics are essential , otherwise it 's just not going to work , " he said .
future versions james key from blackspider said it used scanners , heuristics and programs that can take a broad view of what is happening to a mail server .
if an e-mail server is suddenly struck by thousands of messages bearing the same attachment , it was a fair bet that a virus outbreak was under way , said mr kay .
but graham cluley , senior technology consultant at sophos , said few mail security firms relied solely on scanners to spot and stop viruses getting through to users .
" anti-virus is not just about finding known viruses , " he said .
" we use a heuristic system that will predict what future variants look like . "
