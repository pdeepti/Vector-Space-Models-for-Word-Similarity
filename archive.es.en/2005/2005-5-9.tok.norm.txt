mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

the event was clouded by a debate over moscow 's postwar behavior . a spectacular parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier , after an airborne flypast . russian jets left the white , red and white colors of the russian flag hanging in the sky over red square after the hour-long parade , the centerpiece of commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany . bildunterschrift : soldiers marching during the parade 's dress rehearsal sunday over 50 world leaders attended the lavish parade including german chancellor gerhard schröder and us president george w. bush , who sat next to russian host vladimir putin . in his keynote speech , putin vowed to ensure that there would never be a repeat of either the cold war or a real war . putin also hailed reconciliation between russia and germany as " one of the most important post-war achievements " in europe . " faced with today 's real threats of terrorism , we must remain faithful to the memory of our fathers , " he said .
" we must defend a world order based on security and justice , on a new culture of mutual relations which do not allow any repetition of either cold wars or hot wars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- center -rrb- with russia 's president putin and putin 's wife rain which had threatened to overshadow the ceremonies held off as the parade got underway , also watched by ranks of veterans in full regalia who were among the privileged guests .
while the official program centers on commemorating the allied victory 60 years ago , it is the unscripted crescendo of recriminations between russia and the many countries it dominated from the end of the war until recently , that may determine how this week 's events are remembered .
bush 's latvia trip deepens tensions the parade had been clouded by stormy debate over moscow 's post-war occupation of central and eastern europe . diplomatic exchanges reached a fever pitch as bush visited latvia ahead of his trip to russia , with leaders of the three ex-soviet baltic republics demanding that moscow apologize for postwar soviet occupation of their countries and putin saying moscow had done enough already . bildunterschrift : bush with baltic leaders : estonia 's president arnold rüütel , lithuania 's president valdas adamkus and latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga on saturday in a letter to latvian president vaira vike-freiberga prior to his arrival in riga , bush expressed sympathy with the grievances of former soviet-bloc states in eastern europe .
for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken . " it is precisely this point - the notion that the soviet union in fact " liberated " anyone at all after defeating the nazis - that has reignited latent passions in europe , rekindled historical debate and as a result , to an extent , subverted russia 's v-day celebration even before it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalin is still honored by some russia , reeling not just from the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but from continuing anti-moscow " revolts " in its nearest neighbors and trying to retain a measure of coherence in its own state , appears uninterested in any more expressions of regret for its 20th-century past . " it makes you want to ask : what would have happened to you if we had n't broken the backbone of fascism ?
would your people be among the living today ? "
russian defense minister sergei ivanov said in an interview with the daily rossiyskaya gazeta published wednesday . conciliatory tones speaking to german media last week , however , putin seemed to strike a more conciliatory note .
the soviet takeover of the baltics , he said , was a " tragedy " for the baltic peoples , but the former soviet leadership had already repudiated a 1939 secret deal with nazi germany that let it happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife at the tomb of the unknown soldier in moscow on monday and in an article published in the russian daily komsomolskaya pravda on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder asked for " forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans .

after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .

though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .

sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .

the event was clouded by a debate over moscow 's postwar behavior . a spectacular parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier , after an airborne flypast . russian jets left the white , red and white colors of the russian flag hanging in the sky over red square after the hour-long parade , the centerpiece of commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany . bildunterschrift : soldiers marching during the parade 's dress rehearsal sunday over 50 world leaders attended the lavish parade including german chancellor gerhard schröder and us president george w. bush , who sat next to russian host vladimir putin . in his keynote speech , putin vowed to ensure that there would never be a repeat of either the cold war or a real war . putin also hailed reconciliation between russia and germany as " one of the most important post-war achievements " in europe . " faced with today 's real threats of terrorism , we must remain faithful to the memory of our fathers , " he said .
" we must defend a world order based on security and justice , on a new culture of mutual relations which do not allow any repetition of either cold wars or hot wars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- center -rrb- with russia 's president putin and putin 's wife rain which had threatened to overshadow the ceremonies held off as the parade got underway , also watched by ranks of veterans in full regalia who were among the privileged guests .
while the official program centers on commemorating the allied victory 60 years ago , it is the unscripted crescendo of recriminations between russia and the many countries it dominated from the end of the war until recently , that may determine how this week 's events are remembered .
bush 's latvia trip deepens tensions the parade had been clouded by stormy debate over moscow 's post-war occupation of central and eastern europe . diplomatic exchanges reached a fever pitch as bush visited latvia ahead of his trip to russia , with leaders of the three ex-soviet baltic republics demanding that moscow apologize for postwar soviet occupation of their countries and putin saying moscow had done enough already . bildunterschrift : bush with baltic leaders : estonia 's president arnold rüütel , lithuania 's president valdas adamkus and latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga on saturday in a letter to latvian president vaira vike-freiberga prior to his arrival in riga , bush expressed sympathy with the grievances of former soviet-bloc states in eastern europe .
for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken . " it is precisely this point - the notion that the soviet union in fact " liberated " anyone at all after defeating the nazis - that has reignited latent passions in europe , rekindled historical debate and as a result , to an extent , subverted russia 's v-day celebration even before it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalin is still honored by some russia , reeling not just from the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but from continuing anti-moscow " revolts " in its nearest neighbors and trying to retain a measure of coherence in its own state , appears uninterested in any more expressions of regret for its 20th-century past . " it makes you want to ask : what would have happened to you if we had n't broken the backbone of fascism ?
would your people be among the living today ? "
russian defense minister sergei ivanov said in an interview with the daily rossiyskaya gazeta published wednesday . conciliatory tones speaking to german media last week , however , putin seemed to strike a more conciliatory note .
the soviet takeover of the baltics , he said , was a " tragedy " for the baltic peoples , but the former soviet leadership had already repudiated a 1939 secret deal with nazi germany that let it happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife at the tomb of the unknown soldier in moscow on monday and in an article published in the russian daily komsomolskaya pravda on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder asked for " forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans . " " for no other country was the cost of victory over hitler 's germany so high as for the peoples of the soviet union , " he wrote .

little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .
russia 's favorite holiday during soviet times , the bombastic may 9 parade was n't merely an expression of communist propaganda meant to document the superiority of the soviet system .
bildunterschrift : russian borderguards march during a dress rehearsal of the victory parade on the outskirts of moscow .
the festivities also met a need the people felt , as war veterans or eyewitnesses who endured the hardships on the home front belonged to nearly every family .
thus , even for postwar generations , there was a private aspect to the anniversary .
today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .
after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .
17 , 1917 in the face of little protest .
limited historical perspective but , the enormous symbolic power of the " day of victory " and its steadfast rituals keep russian society from critically analyzing the past .
on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , in 1995 , the poklonnaya gora memorial was unveiled in moscow not in commemoration of world war ii but , in soviet tradition , in honor of the " great patriotic war 1941-1945 . "
as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly-decorated russian war veterans thus , since last year , world war ii veterans no longer take part in the parade .
instead , army associations , veterans of the wars in afghanistan and chechnya and emergency ministry troops parade across red square . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .

60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.05.2005 russia 's day of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian wwii veterans on the eve of moscow 's pomp-filled celebration russians ' suffering during wwii was immeasurable .
little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .
russia 's favorite holiday during soviet times , the bombastic may 9 parade was n't merely an expression of communist propaganda meant to document the superiority of the soviet system .
bildunterschrift : russian borderguards march during a dress rehearsal of the victory parade on the outskirts of moscow .
the festivities also met a need the people felt , as war veterans or eyewitnesses who endured the hardships on the home front belonged to nearly every family .
thus , even for postwar generations , there was a private aspect to the anniversary .
today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .
after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .
17 , 1917 in the face of little protest .
limited historical perspective but , the enormous symbolic power of the " day of victory " and its steadfast rituals keep russian society from critically analyzing the past .
on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , in 1995 , the poklonnaya gora memorial was unveiled in moscow not in commemoration of world war ii but , in soviet tradition , in honor of the " great patriotic war 1941-1945 . "
as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly-decorated russian war veterans thus , since last year , world war ii veterans no longer take part in the parade .
instead , army associations , veterans of the wars in afghanistan and chechnya and emergency ministry troops parade across red square . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .

in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .

little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .

today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .

in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "

in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .

as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .

the vast memorial was built between 1946 and 1949 as a burial site for some 5000 red army soldiers killed during the battle for berlin .
the russian ambassador lay wreaths to honour the soviet troops who fought in world war two .
speaking before red army veterans he said may 8 1945 marked the victory of civilisation over barbarianism .
on monday , may 9 , all eyes will be on moscow as world leaders fly to the russian capital to take part in lavish ceremonies marking the end of wwii .
in an e-mail interview , vladimir kotenev briefly told dw-world his thoughts about the significant occasion .
what is the significance of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war for russia today ?
this date is , without exaggeration , holy for every russian .
the victory over fascism 60 years ago was a deed of the whole of progressive humankind , though the soviet union made the decisive contribution .
our country paid a very high price for the victory : 27 million dead , including 18 million civilian victims ; 33,000 cities and villages were completely destroyed .
still , we weathered the war and won .
may 9 is thus both an occasion for pride as well as a day of remembrance with tears in our eyes for us .
what political conclusions does russia draw from world war ii today ?
do russia 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's current foreign policy , and if so , how ?
even today the results of world war ii have an important affect on the modern world order as well as the norms according to which the states - including russia explicitly - orient themselves in the international arena .
these norms include , firstly , the strict observation of international law ; secondly , the leading role of the un , meaning the global mechanism for the fortification of peace and security in the world which was established as a result of the war ; thirdly , the decisive opposition to powers that propagate the superiority and exclusiveness of an ideology , race , nationality or religion .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence russian politics , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
today 's germany is a country that , according to our opinion , drew the right conclusions from the tragedy of world war ii .
it created mechanisms that prevented repetition of the past .
and it has admitted its guilt .
this germany is our strategic partner , with whom we are connected by joint or similar positions on the fundamental international questions .
exactly for that reason we will receive chancellor gerhard schröder as our friend and partner at the commemorative ceremonies on may 9 in moscow . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president : we will never forget germany is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the nazi surrender in wwii sunday with celebrations of its hard-won democracy , but the day threatens to be overshadowed by a major neo-nazi protest .

what is the significance of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war for russia today ?
this date is , without exaggeration , holy for every russian .
the victory over fascism 60 years ago was a deed of the whole of progressive humankind , though the soviet union made the decisive contribution .
our country paid a very high price for the victory : 27 million dead , including 18 million civilian victims ; 33,000 cities and villages were completely destroyed .
still , we weathered the war and won .
may 9 is thus both an occasion for pride as well as a day of remembrance with tears in our eyes for us .
what political conclusions does russia draw from world war ii today ?
do russia 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's current foreign policy , and if so , how ?
even today the results of world war ii have an important affect on the modern world order as well as the norms according to which the states - including russia explicitly - orient themselves in the international arena .
these norms include , firstly , the strict observation of international law ; secondly , the leading role of the un , meaning the global mechanism for the fortification of peace and security in the world which was established as a result of the war ; thirdly , the decisive opposition to powers that propagate the superiority and exclusiveness of an ideology , race , nationality or religion .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence russian politics , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
today 's germany is a country that , according to our opinion , drew the right conclusions from the tragedy of world war ii .
it created mechanisms that prevented repetition of the past .
and it has admitted its guilt .
this germany is our strategic partner , with whom we are connected by joint or similar positions on the fundamental international questions .

the court decision thereby prevents a mother from breaking off the contact between a child and his or her biological father or by using the issue of adoption to sway custody cases .

"
the writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain . managing life 's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in schiller 's works .
the artist himself was a prime example as he showed how the mind can triumph over a sick body for most of his life . schiller 's fever attacks often became so severe that rumors of his death spread frequently .
but again and again he managed to leave his sick bed and return to the writing desk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller statue in berlin " when he finally died , the duke said , ' let 's cut him open , " ' wrote schiller 's biographer , rüdiger safranski .
doctors had long considered the writer a medical phenomenon : due to his medical history , they felt he should have died much earlier . but " one should call it idealism , when someone manages to live 10 years longer than the body would permit simply because of the power of enthusiasm and mind , " safranski wrote . a dominating duke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birth house -lrb- center -rrb- in marbach schiller was born on nov .
10 , 1759 in marbach on the neckar in southwestern germany .
his father worked as an army doctor for duke karl eugen of württemberg .
his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper .
while in school , schiller wanted to become a priest , but the duke prevented this .
in 1773 , he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy .
as his father served in the army , it was a request he could n't refuse . the school turned out to be hell for schiller , who suffered under the strict regimen .
to deal with the pressure , he began to write - first poems , followed by the play " the robbers " in 1777 .
while secretly working on the play , he also wrote a medical dissertation . the latter was finished in 1780 , the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on jan .
13 , 1783 .
schiller 's passionate plea for freedom turned " the robbers " into a sensational success and made him the " poet of peace . " fleeing his homeland needless to say , the duke was n't thrilled about schiller 's lust for liberty and banned him from writing .
schiller responded by fleeing his homeland in 1782 , making his living as a freelance writer from then on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant he quickly wrote " fiesco , " " love and intrigue " and " don carlos " and crisscrossed germany - partly to escape the duke 's wrath , partly to find new sources of funding .
in 1787 , in the eastern german town of jena , he first learned about kant 's philosophy , which influenced him tremendously .
he also met his future wife , charlotte von lengefeld , in jena . the french revolution of 1789 fascinated schiller - after all , it was about liberty .
but its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history .
during the following years , he almost completely gave up literary writing and focussed on historical-philosophical research instead . a world-famous friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jena 's university today in 1790 , he settled in jena , where he taught history at the university .
a year later , the newly-wed poet fell ill with pneumonia , which later caused him almost unbearable pain as it led to a suppuration of the pleura , the pericardium and his kidneys . in 1794 , schiller began a friendship with johann wolfgang von goethe , which took on a central role in the lives of both poets and became a highlight of germany 's literary history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller memorial in weimar goethe encouraged schiller to write again and together , they composed the famous " xenia " satirical poems .
in 1799 , schiller moved to weimar to be closer to goethe , only to fall sick again one year later .
as a medical doctor , schiller realized that he did n't have much time left and set out to complete the works that were to make him famous around the globe : " wilhelm tell , " the wallenstein trilogy , " mary stuart , " and the " maid of orleans .

the event was clouded by a debate over moscow 's postwar behavior . a spectacular parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier , after an airborne flypast . russian jets left the white , red and white colors of the russian flag hanging in the sky over red square after the hour-long parade , the centerpiece of commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany . bildunterschrift : soldiers marching during the parade 's dress rehearsal sunday over 50 world leaders attended the lavish parade including german chancellor gerhard schröder and us president george w. bush , who sat next to russian host vladimir putin . in his keynote speech , putin vowed to ensure that there would never be a repeat of either the cold war or a real war . putin also hailed reconciliation between russia and germany as " one of the most important post-war achievements " in europe . " faced with today 's real threats of terrorism , we must remain faithful to the memory of our fathers , " he said .
" we must defend a world order based on security and justice , on a new culture of mutual relations which do not allow any repetition of either cold wars or hot wars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- center -rrb- with russia 's president putin and putin 's wife rain which had threatened to overshadow the ceremonies held off as the parade got underway , also watched by ranks of veterans in full regalia who were among the privileged guests .
while the official program centers on commemorating the allied victory 60 years ago , it is the unscripted crescendo of recriminations between russia and the many countries it dominated from the end of the war until recently , that may determine how this week 's events are remembered .
bush 's latvia trip deepens tensions the parade had been clouded by stormy debate over moscow 's post-war occupation of central and eastern europe . diplomatic exchanges reached a fever pitch as bush visited latvia ahead of his trip to russia , with leaders of the three ex-soviet baltic republics demanding that moscow apologize for postwar soviet occupation of their countries and putin saying moscow had done enough already . bildunterschrift : bush with baltic leaders : estonia 's president arnold rüütel , lithuania 's president valdas adamkus and latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga on saturday in a letter to latvian president vaira vike-freiberga prior to his arrival in riga , bush expressed sympathy with the grievances of former soviet-bloc states in eastern europe .
for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken . " it is precisely this point - the notion that the soviet union in fact " liberated " anyone at all after defeating the nazis - that has reignited latent passions in europe , rekindled historical debate and as a result , to an extent , subverted russia 's v-day celebration even before it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalin is still honored by some russia , reeling not just from the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but from continuing anti-moscow " revolts " in its nearest neighbors and trying to retain a measure of coherence in its own state , appears uninterested in any more expressions of regret for its 20th-century past . " it makes you want to ask : what would have happened to you if we had n't broken the backbone of fascism ?
would your people be among the living today ? "
russian defense minister sergei ivanov said in an interview with the daily rossiyskaya gazeta published wednesday . conciliatory tones speaking to german media last week , however , putin seemed to strike a more conciliatory note .
the soviet takeover of the baltics , he said , was a " tragedy " for the baltic peoples , but the former soviet leadership had already repudiated a 1939 secret deal with nazi germany that let it happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife at the tomb of the unknown soldier in moscow on monday and in an article published in the russian daily komsomolskaya pravda on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder asked for " forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans . " " for no other country was the cost of victory over hitler 's germany so high as for the peoples of the soviet union , " he wrote .
" losses of over 26 million people and indescribable destruction were the frightening result of world war ii for the former soviet union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.05.2005 gladbach stays on top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's daun scored to help his club stay in the bundesliga as a result of a 2-1 victory against bochum , nuremberg have assured themselves a spot in the first bundesliga next season .
mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .

their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .

nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .

he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .

for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .

" i ca n't explain it , either , " werner told the tabloid , adding that he even put on weight since switching to natural light as his source of nutrition .
" apparently light energy can be turned into nutrition if one really believes it . " werner claims that he now drinks about 1.5 liters -lrb- about 3 pints -rrb- of water , juices , tea or coffee each day . but even bild , which loves a good sensation , had to get a second opinion on the matter .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the far right-wing national democratic party npd walk infront of the frauenkirche church of our lady and carry flags of their party during their rally through dresden , eastern germany , sunday , feb .
13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .
it 's at the heart of lea rosh 's next project : to raise money so the facility can exhibit the biographic data of more than three million murdered jews . marcel füstenau -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's difficult path this year 's 60th anniversary commemorations of the end of world war ii are highlighting just how dramatically germany 's relationship with its difficult postwar legacy has changed , says dw-world 's marc young .

she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' .

seifert , left , and breuer are history two top executives of the german stock exchage lost their jobs in a struggle with shareholders over a failed takeover bid for the london stock exchange . heads rolled at german stock market operator deutsche börse on monday .
chief executive werner seifert and rolf breuer , head of the supervisory board , agreed to step down after a long and bitter battle with major shareholders , which began when deutsche börse announced plans to take over the london stock exchange . following an extraordinary meeting of the group 's supervisory board , deutsche börse announced that seifert " will be leaving the company with immediate effect . " and " by the end of this year , rolf breuer will resign from the supervisory board and hand over his responsibilities to a successor . " long-running fued the resignations , largely expected , were the culmination of a long and bitter battle between deutsche börse 's management and its major shareholders , particularly the anglo-saxon private equity firms tci and atticus capital , which together hold around 15 percent of the operator 's share capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seifert as the lse merger was announced the long-running feud originally broke out late last year , when seifert -lrb- photo -rrb- , with breuer 's backing , announced plans for deutsche börse to take over the lse . the idea immediately ran into fierce resistance from deutsche börse 's shareholders and tci -lrb- the children 's investment fund -rrb- spearheaded a campaign to have the plans aborted . faulty acquisition plan the rebel shareholders , arguing that the acquisition price was too high and the money would be better used by paying out in the form of a higher dividend and a share buyback , eventually won the battle and forced deutsche börse to bury its ambitions . but tci went even further , launching a campaign to have seifert and breuer kicked out of office . in an attempt to defuse the incendiary atmosphere , deutsche börse has repeatedly sought to placate the rebel shareholders in recent weeks , offering to transfer to shareholders " a significant proportion " of the cash reserves it had set aside to finance the takeover .
it also actively sought to give the shareholders greater say in the running of the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange sign but tci refused to be appeased and continued to call for the heads of both breuer and seifert . in its statement monday , deutsche börse said breuer had been mandated " to change the composition of the supervisory and executive boards in order to reflect the new ownership structure of the company . " as part of those changes , three supervisory board members would resign and breuer would try to find replacements " in a timely fashion , " the company said . replacements sought already last month , peter levene , the head of the world 's leading insurance market lloyd 's , announced his resignation from the supervisory board . when seeking new board members , " breuer will consult closely with deutsche boerse shareholders , " the company said . breuer had also been asked to find a successor for seifert .

seifert , left , and breuer are history two top executives of the german stock exchage lost their jobs in a struggle with shareholders over a failed takeover bid for the london stock exchange . heads rolled at german stock market operator deutsche börse on monday .
chief executive werner seifert and rolf breuer , head of the supervisory board , agreed to step down after a long and bitter battle with major shareholders , which began when deutsche börse announced plans to take over the london stock exchange . following an extraordinary meeting of the group 's supervisory board , deutsche börse announced that seifert " will be leaving the company with immediate effect . " and " by the end of this year , rolf breuer will resign from the supervisory board and hand over his responsibilities to a successor . " long-running fued the resignations , largely expected , were the culmination of a long and bitter battle between deutsche börse 's management and its major shareholders , particularly the anglo-saxon private equity firms tci and atticus capital , which together hold around 15 percent of the operator 's share capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seifert as the lse merger was announced the long-running feud originally broke out late last year , when seifert -lrb- photo -rrb- , with breuer 's backing , announced plans for deutsche börse to take over the lse . the idea immediately ran into fierce resistance from deutsche börse 's shareholders and tci -lrb- the children 's investment fund -rrb- spearheaded a campaign to have the plans aborted . faulty acquisition plan the rebel shareholders , arguing that the acquisition price was too high and the money would be better used by paying out in the form of a higher dividend and a share buyback , eventually won the battle and forced deutsche börse to bury its ambitions . but tci went even further , launching a campaign to have seifert and breuer kicked out of office . in an attempt to defuse the incendiary atmosphere , deutsche börse has repeatedly sought to placate the rebel shareholders in recent weeks , offering to transfer to shareholders " a significant proportion " of the cash reserves it had set aside to finance the takeover .
it also actively sought to give the shareholders greater say in the running of the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange sign but tci refused to be appeased and continued to call for the heads of both breuer and seifert . in its statement monday , deutsche börse said breuer had been mandated " to change the composition of the supervisory and executive boards in order to reflect the new ownership structure of the company . " as part of those changes , three supervisory board members would resign and breuer would try to find replacements " in a timely fashion , " the company said . replacements sought already last month , peter levene , the head of the world 's leading insurance market lloyd 's , announced his resignation from the supervisory board . when seeking new board members , " breuer will consult closely with deutsche boerse shareholders , " the company said . breuer had also been asked to find a successor for seifert .

"
the writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain . managing life 's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in schiller 's works .
the artist himself was a prime example as he showed how the mind can triumph over a sick body for most of his life . schiller 's fever attacks often became so severe that rumors of his death spread frequently .
but again and again he managed to leave his sick bed and return to the writing desk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller statue in berlin " when he finally died , the duke said , ' let 's cut him open , " ' wrote schiller 's biographer , rüdiger safranski .
doctors had long considered the writer a medical phenomenon : due to his medical history , they felt he should have died much earlier . but " one should call it idealism , when someone manages to live 10 years longer than the body would permit simply because of the power of enthusiasm and mind , " safranski wrote . a dominating duke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birth house -lrb- center -rrb- in marbach schiller was born on nov .
10 , 1759 in marbach on the neckar in southwestern germany .
his father worked as an army doctor for duke karl eugen of württemberg .
his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper .
while in school , schiller wanted to become a priest , but the duke prevented this .
in 1773 , he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy .
as his father served in the army , it was a request he could n't refuse . the school turned out to be hell for schiller , who suffered under the strict regimen .
to deal with the pressure , he began to write - first poems , followed by the play " the robbers " in 1777 .
while secretly working on the play , he also wrote a medical dissertation . the latter was finished in 1780 , the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on jan .
13 , 1783 .
schiller 's passionate plea for freedom turned " the robbers " into a sensational success and made him the " poet of peace . " fleeing his homeland needless to say , the duke was n't thrilled about schiller 's lust for liberty and banned him from writing .
schiller responded by fleeing his homeland in 1782 , making his living as a freelance writer from then on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant he quickly wrote " fiesco , " " love and intrigue " and " don carlos " and crisscrossed germany - partly to escape the duke 's wrath , partly to find new sources of funding .
in 1787 , in the eastern german town of jena , he first learned about kant 's philosophy , which influenced him tremendously .
he also met his future wife , charlotte von lengefeld , in jena . the french revolution of 1789 fascinated schiller - after all , it was about liberty .
but its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history .
during the following years , he almost completely gave up literary writing and focussed on historical-philosophical research instead . a world-famous friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jena 's university today in 1790 , he settled in jena , where he taught history at the university .
a year later , the newly-wed poet fell ill with pneumonia , which later caused him almost unbearable pain as it led to a suppuration of the pleura , the pericardium and his kidneys . in 1794 , schiller began a friendship with johann wolfgang von goethe , which took on a central role in the lives of both poets and became a highlight of germany 's literary history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller memorial in weimar goethe encouraged schiller to write again and together , they composed the famous " xenia " satirical poems .
in 1799 , schiller moved to weimar to be closer to goethe , only to fall sick again one year later .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .

he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

seifert , left , and breuer are history two top executives of the german stock exchage lost their jobs in a struggle with shareholders over a failed takeover bid for the london stock exchange . heads rolled at german stock market operator deutsche börse on monday .
chief executive werner seifert and rolf breuer , head of the supervisory board , agreed to step down after a long and bitter battle with major shareholders , which began when deutsche börse announced plans to take over the london stock exchange . following an extraordinary meeting of the group 's supervisory board , deutsche börse announced that seifert " will be leaving the company with immediate effect . " and " by the end of this year , rolf breuer will resign from the supervisory board and hand over his responsibilities to a successor . " long-running fued the resignations , largely expected , were the culmination of a long and bitter battle between deutsche börse 's management and its major shareholders , particularly the anglo-saxon private equity firms tci and atticus capital , which together hold around 15 percent of the operator 's share capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : seifert as the lse merger was announced the long-running feud originally broke out late last year , when seifert -lrb- photo -rrb- , with breuer 's backing , announced plans for deutsche börse to take over the lse . the idea immediately ran into fierce resistance from deutsche börse 's shareholders and tci -lrb- the children 's investment fund -rrb- spearheaded a campaign to have the plans aborted . faulty acquisition plan the rebel shareholders , arguing that the acquisition price was too high and the money would be better used by paying out in the form of a higher dividend and a share buyback , eventually won the battle and forced deutsche börse to bury its ambitions . but tci went even further , launching a campaign to have seifert and breuer kicked out of office . in an attempt to defuse the incendiary atmosphere , deutsche börse has repeatedly sought to placate the rebel shareholders in recent weeks , offering to transfer to shareholders " a significant proportion " of the cash reserves it had set aside to finance the takeover .
it also actively sought to give the shareholders greater say in the running of the company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt stock exchange sign but tci refused to be appeased and continued to call for the heads of both breuer and seifert . in its statement monday , deutsche börse said breuer had been mandated " to change the composition of the supervisory and executive boards in order to reflect the new ownership structure of the company . " as part of those changes , three supervisory board members would resign and breuer would try to find replacements " in a timely fashion , " the company said . replacements sought already last month , peter levene , the head of the world 's leading insurance market lloyd 's , announced his resignation from the supervisory board . when seeking new board members , " breuer will consult closely with deutsche boerse shareholders , " the company said . breuer had also been asked to find a successor for seifert .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .
it 's at the heart of lea rosh 's next project : to raise money so the facility can exhibit the biographic data of more than three million murdered jews . marcel füstenau -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's difficult path this year 's 60th anniversary commemorations of the end of world war ii are highlighting just how dramatically germany 's relationship with its difficult postwar legacy has changed , says dw-world 's marc young .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the far right-wing national democratic party npd walk infront of the frauenkirche church of our lady and carry flags of their party during their rally through dresden , eastern germany , sunday , feb .
13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

the vast memorial was built between 1946 and 1949 as a burial site for some 5000 red army soldiers killed during the battle for berlin .
the russian ambassador lay wreaths to honour the soviet troops who fought in world war two .
speaking before red army veterans he said may 8 1945 marked the victory of civilisation over barbarianism .
on monday , may 9 , all eyes will be on moscow as world leaders fly to the russian capital to take part in lavish ceremonies marking the end of wwii .
in an e-mail interview , vladimir kotenev briefly told dw-world his thoughts about the significant occasion .
what is the significance of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war for russia today ?
this date is , without exaggeration , holy for every russian .
the victory over fascism 60 years ago was a deed of the whole of progressive humankind , though the soviet union made the decisive contribution .
our country paid a very high price for the victory : 27 million dead , including 18 million civilian victims ; 33,000 cities and villages were completely destroyed .
still , we weathered the war and won .
may 9 is thus both an occasion for pride as well as a day of remembrance with tears in our eyes for us .
what political conclusions does russia draw from world war ii today ?

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.05.2005 a journalist 's memorial to holocaust victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from yad vashem to berlin : lea rosh and architect peter eisenman after journalist lea rosh first publicized plans for a central german holocaust memorial 17 years ago , her life 's work will finally be inaugurated .
deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .
it 's at the heart of lea rosh 's next project : to raise money so the facility can exhibit the biographic data of more than three million murdered jews . marcel füstenau -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : germany 's difficult path this year 's 60th anniversary commemorations of the end of world war ii are highlighting just how dramatically germany 's relationship with its difficult postwar legacy has changed , says dw-world 's marc young .

after another week of juices , he said his body had adjusted to the food-free life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-indulging ?

" apparently light energy can be turned into nutrition if one really believes it . " werner claims that he now drinks about 1.5 liters -lrb- about 3 pints -rrb- of water , juices , tea or coffee each day . but even bild , which loves a good sensation , had to get a second opinion on the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.05.2005 putin : no more wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating 60 years of victory a parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier .
the event was clouded by a debate over moscow 's postwar behavior . a spectacular parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier , after an airborne flypast . russian jets left the white , red and white colors of the russian flag hanging in the sky over red square after the hour-long parade , the centerpiece of commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany . bildunterschrift : soldiers marching during the parade 's dress rehearsal sunday over 50 world leaders attended the lavish parade including german chancellor gerhard schröder and us president george w. bush , who sat next to russian host vladimir putin . in his keynote speech , putin vowed to ensure that there would never be a repeat of either the cold war or a real war . putin also hailed reconciliation between russia and germany as " one of the most important post-war achievements " in europe . " faced with today 's real threats of terrorism , we must remain faithful to the memory of our fathers , " he said .
" we must defend a world order based on security and justice , on a new culture of mutual relations which do not allow any repetition of either cold wars or hot wars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- center -rrb- with russia 's president putin and putin 's wife rain which had threatened to overshadow the ceremonies held off as the parade got underway , also watched by ranks of veterans in full regalia who were among the privileged guests .
while the official program centers on commemorating the allied victory 60 years ago , it is the unscripted crescendo of recriminations between russia and the many countries it dominated from the end of the war until recently , that may determine how this week 's events are remembered .
bush 's latvia trip deepens tensions the parade had been clouded by stormy debate over moscow 's post-war occupation of central and eastern europe . diplomatic exchanges reached a fever pitch as bush visited latvia ahead of his trip to russia , with leaders of the three ex-soviet baltic republics demanding that moscow apologize for postwar soviet occupation of their countries and putin saying moscow had done enough already . bildunterschrift : bush with baltic leaders : estonia 's president arnold rüütel , lithuania 's president valdas adamkus and latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga on saturday in a letter to latvian president vaira vike-freiberga prior to his arrival in riga , bush expressed sympathy with the grievances of former soviet-bloc states in eastern europe .
for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken . " it is precisely this point - the notion that the soviet union in fact " liberated " anyone at all after defeating the nazis - that has reignited latent passions in europe , rekindled historical debate and as a result , to an extent , subverted russia 's v-day celebration even before it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalin is still honored by some russia , reeling not just from the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but from continuing anti-moscow " revolts " in its nearest neighbors and trying to retain a measure of coherence in its own state , appears uninterested in any more expressions of regret for its 20th-century past . " it makes you want to ask : what would have happened to you if we had n't broken the backbone of fascism ?
would your people be among the living today ? "
russian defense minister sergei ivanov said in an interview with the daily rossiyskaya gazeta published wednesday . conciliatory tones speaking to german media last week , however , putin seemed to strike a more conciliatory note .
the soviet takeover of the baltics , he said , was a " tragedy " for the baltic peoples , but the former soviet leadership had already repudiated a 1939 secret deal with nazi germany that let it happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife at the tomb of the unknown soldier in moscow on monday and in an article published in the russian daily komsomolskaya pravda on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder asked for " forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans . " " for no other country was the cost of victory over hitler 's germany so high as for the peoples of the soviet union , " he wrote .
" losses of over 26 million people and indescribable destruction were the frightening result of world war ii for the former soviet union .

the event was clouded by a debate over moscow 's postwar behavior . a spectacular parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier , after an airborne flypast . russian jets left the white , red and white colors of the russian flag hanging in the sky over red square after the hour-long parade , the centerpiece of commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany . bildunterschrift : soldiers marching during the parade 's dress rehearsal sunday over 50 world leaders attended the lavish parade including german chancellor gerhard schröder and us president george w. bush , who sat next to russian host vladimir putin . in his keynote speech , putin vowed to ensure that there would never be a repeat of either the cold war or a real war . putin also hailed reconciliation between russia and germany as " one of the most important post-war achievements " in europe . " faced with today 's real threats of terrorism , we must remain faithful to the memory of our fathers , " he said .
" we must defend a world order based on security and justice , on a new culture of mutual relations which do not allow any repetition of either cold wars or hot wars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- center -rrb- with russia 's president putin and putin 's wife rain which had threatened to overshadow the ceremonies held off as the parade got underway , also watched by ranks of veterans in full regalia who were among the privileged guests .
while the official program centers on commemorating the allied victory 60 years ago , it is the unscripted crescendo of recriminations between russia and the many countries it dominated from the end of the war until recently , that may determine how this week 's events are remembered .
bush 's latvia trip deepens tensions the parade had been clouded by stormy debate over moscow 's post-war occupation of central and eastern europe . diplomatic exchanges reached a fever pitch as bush visited latvia ahead of his trip to russia , with leaders of the three ex-soviet baltic republics demanding that moscow apologize for postwar soviet occupation of their countries and putin saying moscow had done enough already . bildunterschrift : bush with baltic leaders : estonia 's president arnold rüütel , lithuania 's president valdas adamkus and latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga on saturday in a letter to latvian president vaira vike-freiberga prior to his arrival in riga , bush expressed sympathy with the grievances of former soviet-bloc states in eastern europe .
for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken . " it is precisely this point - the notion that the soviet union in fact " liberated " anyone at all after defeating the nazis - that has reignited latent passions in europe , rekindled historical debate and as a result , to an extent , subverted russia 's v-day celebration even before it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalin is still honored by some russia , reeling not just from the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but from continuing anti-moscow " revolts " in its nearest neighbors and trying to retain a measure of coherence in its own state , appears uninterested in any more expressions of regret for its 20th-century past . " it makes you want to ask : what would have happened to you if we had n't broken the backbone of fascism ?
would your people be among the living today ? "

" but this does n't mean that people should foster a victims ' culture .
germany was responsible for the outbreak of world war ii . " blair added that the world must never forget the horrors that took place between 1939 and 1945 , but said that former enemies had now become friends .

" we have to combine our resources where it makes sense - fighting crime , establishing a common market , protecting the environment , fighting illegal immigration , " he said . but blair added that nation states should have the last word in areas where they were most suited to make decisions . " that 's the case with fiscal and foreign policy , " he said .
" that 's the european union as laid out in the constitution treaty .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the far right-wing national democratic party npd walk infront of the frauenkirche church of our lady and carry flags of their party during their rally through dresden , eastern germany , sunday , feb .
13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .
russia 's favorite holiday during soviet times , the bombastic may 9 parade was n't merely an expression of communist propaganda meant to document the superiority of the soviet system .
bildunterschrift : russian borderguards march during a dress rehearsal of the victory parade on the outskirts of moscow .
the festivities also met a need the people felt , as war veterans or eyewitnesses who endured the hardships on the home front belonged to nearly every family .
thus , even for postwar generations , there was a private aspect to the anniversary .
today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .
after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .
17 , 1917 in the face of little protest .
limited historical perspective but , the enormous symbolic power of the " day of victory " and its steadfast rituals keep russian society from critically analyzing the past .
on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , in 1995 , the poklonnaya gora memorial was unveiled in moscow not in commemoration of world war ii but , in soviet tradition , in honor of the " great patriotic war 1941-1945 . "
as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly-decorated russian war veterans thus , since last year , world war ii veterans no longer take part in the parade .

the vast memorial was built between 1946 and 1949 as a burial site for some 5000 red army soldiers killed during the battle for berlin .
the russian ambassador lay wreaths to honour the soviet troops who fought in world war two .
speaking before red army veterans he said may 8 1945 marked the victory of civilisation over barbarianism .
on monday , may 9 , all eyes will be on moscow as world leaders fly to the russian capital to take part in lavish ceremonies marking the end of wwii .
in an e-mail interview , vladimir kotenev briefly told dw-world his thoughts about the significant occasion .
what is the significance of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war for russia today ?
this date is , without exaggeration , holy for every russian .
the victory over fascism 60 years ago was a deed of the whole of progressive humankind , though the soviet union made the decisive contribution .
our country paid a very high price for the victory : 27 million dead , including 18 million civilian victims ; 33,000 cities and villages were completely destroyed .
still , we weathered the war and won .
may 9 is thus both an occasion for pride as well as a day of remembrance with tears in our eyes for us .
what political conclusions does russia draw from world war ii today ?
do russia 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's current foreign policy , and if so , how ?
even today the results of world war ii have an important affect on the modern world order as well as the norms according to which the states - including russia explicitly - orient themselves in the international arena .
these norms include , firstly , the strict observation of international law ; secondly , the leading role of the un , meaning the global mechanism for the fortification of peace and security in the world which was established as a result of the war ; thirdly , the decisive opposition to powers that propagate the superiority and exclusiveness of an ideology , race , nationality or religion .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence russian politics , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
today 's germany is a country that , according to our opinion , drew the right conclusions from the tragedy of world war ii .
it created mechanisms that prevented repetition of the past .
and it has admitted its guilt .
this germany is our strategic partner , with whom we are connected by joint or similar positions on the fundamental international questions .
exactly for that reason we will receive chancellor gerhard schröder as our friend and partner at the commemorative ceremonies on may 9 in moscow . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president : we will never forget germany is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the nazi surrender in wwii sunday with celebrations of its hard-won democracy , but the day threatens to be overshadowed by a major neo-nazi protest .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the far right-wing national democratic party npd walk infront of the frauenkirche church of our lady and carry flags of their party during their rally through dresden , eastern germany , sunday , feb .
13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .

" but this does n't mean that people should foster a victims ' culture .
germany was responsible for the outbreak of world war ii . " blair added that the world must never forget the horrors that took place between 1939 and 1945 , but said that former enemies had now become friends . " britain and germany have played a leading role in the development of europe as a continent of peace and prosperity , " he said .

" we have to combine our resources where it makes sense - fighting crime , establishing a common market , protecting the environment , fighting illegal immigration , " he said . but blair added that nation states should have the last word in areas where they were most suited to make decisions . " that 's the case with fiscal and foreign policy , " he said .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the far right-wing national democratic party npd walk infront of the frauenkirche church of our lady and carry flags of their party during their rally through dresden , eastern germany , sunday , feb .
13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the far right-wing national democratic party npd walk infront of the frauenkirche church of our lady and carry flags of their party during their rally through dresden , eastern germany , sunday , feb .
13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

germany was responsible for the outbreak of world war ii .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

these norms include , firstly , the strict observation of international law ; secondly , the leading role of the un , meaning the global mechanism for the fortification of peace and security in the world which was established as a result of the war ; thirdly , the decisive opposition to powers that propagate the superiority and exclusiveness of an ideology , race , nationality or religion .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the far right-wing national democratic party npd walk infront of the frauenkirche church of our lady and carry flags of their party during their rally through dresden , eastern germany , sunday , feb .
13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .

60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .

13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .

60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .

13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

"
the writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain . managing life 's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in schiller 's works .
the artist himself was a prime example as he showed how the mind can triumph over a sick body for most of his life . schiller 's fever attacks often became so severe that rumors of his death spread frequently .
but again and again he managed to leave his sick bed and return to the writing desk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller statue in berlin " when he finally died , the duke said , ' let 's cut him open , " ' wrote schiller 's biographer , rüdiger safranski .
doctors had long considered the writer a medical phenomenon : due to his medical history , they felt he should have died much earlier . but " one should call it idealism , when someone manages to live 10 years longer than the body would permit simply because of the power of enthusiasm and mind , " safranski wrote . a dominating duke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birth house -lrb- center -rrb- in marbach schiller was born on nov .
10 , 1759 in marbach on the neckar in southwestern germany .
his father worked as an army doctor for duke karl eugen of württemberg .
his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper .
while in school , schiller wanted to become a priest , but the duke prevented this .
in 1773 , he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy .
as his father served in the army , it was a request he could n't refuse . the school turned out to be hell for schiller , who suffered under the strict regimen .
to deal with the pressure , he began to write - first poems , followed by the play " the robbers " in 1777 .
while secretly working on the play , he also wrote a medical dissertation . the latter was finished in 1780 , the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on jan .
13 , 1783 .
schiller 's passionate plea for freedom turned " the robbers " into a sensational success and made him the " poet of peace . " fleeing his homeland needless to say , the duke was n't thrilled about schiller 's lust for liberty and banned him from writing .
schiller responded by fleeing his homeland in 1782 , making his living as a freelance writer from then on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant he quickly wrote " fiesco , " " love and intrigue " and " don carlos " and crisscrossed germany - partly to escape the duke 's wrath , partly to find new sources of funding .
in 1787 , in the eastern german town of jena , he first learned about kant 's philosophy , which influenced him tremendously .
he also met his future wife , charlotte von lengefeld , in jena . the french revolution of 1789 fascinated schiller - after all , it was about liberty .
but its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.05.2005 russia 's day of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian wwii veterans on the eve of moscow 's pomp-filled celebration russians ' suffering during wwii was immeasurable .
little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .
russia 's favorite holiday during soviet times , the bombastic may 9 parade was n't merely an expression of communist propaganda meant to document the superiority of the soviet system .
bildunterschrift : russian borderguards march during a dress rehearsal of the victory parade on the outskirts of moscow .
the festivities also met a need the people felt , as war veterans or eyewitnesses who endured the hardships on the home front belonged to nearly every family .
thus , even for postwar generations , there was a private aspect to the anniversary .
today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .
after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .
17 , 1917 in the face of little protest .
limited historical perspective but , the enormous symbolic power of the " day of victory " and its steadfast rituals keep russian society from critically analyzing the past .
on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , in 1995 , the poklonnaya gora memorial was unveiled in moscow not in commemoration of world war ii but , in soviet tradition , in honor of the " great patriotic war 1941-1945 . "
as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly-decorated russian war veterans thus , since last year , world war ii veterans no longer take part in the parade .
instead , army associations , veterans of the wars in afghanistan and chechnya and emergency ministry troops parade across red square . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .

13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

"
the writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain . managing life 's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in schiller 's works .
the artist himself was a prime example as he showed how the mind can triumph over a sick body for most of his life . schiller 's fever attacks often became so severe that rumors of his death spread frequently .
but again and again he managed to leave his sick bed and return to the writing desk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller statue in berlin " when he finally died , the duke said , ' let 's cut him open , " ' wrote schiller 's biographer , rüdiger safranski .
doctors had long considered the writer a medical phenomenon : due to his medical history , they felt he should have died much earlier . but " one should call it idealism , when someone manages to live 10 years longer than the body would permit simply because of the power of enthusiasm and mind , " safranski wrote . a dominating duke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birth house -lrb- center -rrb- in marbach schiller was born on nov .
10 , 1759 in marbach on the neckar in southwestern germany .
his father worked as an army doctor for duke karl eugen of württemberg .
his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper .
while in school , schiller wanted to become a priest , but the duke prevented this .
in 1773 , he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy .
as his father served in the army , it was a request he could n't refuse . the school turned out to be hell for schiller , who suffered under the strict regimen .
to deal with the pressure , he began to write - first poems , followed by the play " the robbers " in 1777 .
while secretly working on the play , he also wrote a medical dissertation . the latter was finished in 1780 , the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on jan .
13 , 1783 .
schiller 's passionate plea for freedom turned " the robbers " into a sensational success and made him the " poet of peace . " fleeing his homeland needless to say , the duke was n't thrilled about schiller 's lust for liberty and banned him from writing .
schiller responded by fleeing his homeland in 1782 , making his living as a freelance writer from then on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant he quickly wrote " fiesco , " " love and intrigue " and " don carlos " and crisscrossed germany - partly to escape the duke 's wrath , partly to find new sources of funding .
in 1787 , in the eastern german town of jena , he first learned about kant 's philosophy , which influenced him tremendously .
he also met his future wife , charlotte von lengefeld , in jena . the french revolution of 1789 fascinated schiller - after all , it was about liberty .
but its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history .
during the following years , he almost completely gave up literary writing and focussed on historical-philosophical research instead . a world-famous friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jena 's university today in 1790 , he settled in jena , where he taught history at the university .
a year later , the newly-wed poet fell ill with pneumonia , which later caused him almost unbearable pain as it led to a suppuration of the pleura , the pericardium and his kidneys . in 1794 , schiller began a friendship with johann wolfgang von goethe , which took on a central role in the lives of both poets and became a highlight of germany 's literary history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller memorial in weimar goethe encouraged schiller to write again and together , they composed the famous " xenia " satirical poems .
in 1799 , schiller moved to weimar to be closer to goethe , only to fall sick again one year later .
as a medical doctor , schiller realized that he did n't have much time left and set out to complete the works that were to make him famous around the globe : " wilhelm tell , " the wallenstein trilogy , " mary stuart , " and the " maid of orleans .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .

their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

germany was responsible for the outbreak of world war ii .

" we have to combine our resources where it makes sense - fighting crime , establishing a common market , protecting the environment , fighting illegal immigration , " he said . but blair added that nation states should have the last word in areas where they were most suited to make decisions . " that 's the case with fiscal and foreign policy , " he said .

little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .
russia 's favorite holiday during soviet times , the bombastic may 9 parade was n't merely an expression of communist propaganda meant to document the superiority of the soviet system .

the festivities also met a need the people felt , as war veterans or eyewitnesses who endured the hardships on the home front belonged to nearly every family .
thus , even for postwar generations , there was a private aspect to the anniversary .
today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .
after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .

as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.05.2005 gladbach stays on top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's daun scored to help his club stay in the bundesliga as a result of a 2-1 victory against bochum , nuremberg have assured themselves a spot in the first bundesliga next season .
mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.05.2005 gladbach stays on top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's daun scored to help his club stay in the bundesliga as a result of a 2-1 victory against bochum , nuremberg have assured themselves a spot in the first bundesliga next season .
mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .

few things have so drastically altered the course of modern history as world war ii and its aftermath .
the passage of time was bound to shape how germans and the rest of the world dealt with the legacy of the 20th century 's worst conflict , but 60 years on , we stand on the verge of a watershed .
the latest wwii commemorations will likely be the last with the few remaining firsthand witnesses of that era .
and it 's the acknowledgment that the responsibility to remember the war is being forever handed from one generation to the next that has increased the poignancy of the nearly daily events marking the liberation of death camps and last battles leading up to the allied defeat of hitler 's third reich .
naturally , this year has been a time for considerable reflection by many germans how best to keep alive the lessons learned from the darkest chapter of their nation 's history .
the crimes nazi germany visited upon the world were undoubtedly some of the most horrible ever committed by humanity .
but few countries have so thoroughly and so commendably confronted the demons of the past as postwar germany has .
though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .

13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

though by no means always an easy process , modern germany has made the painful wwii legacy part of its national identity .
for example , officials this month will inaugurate a massive memorial to the millions of jews murdered during the holocaust at the very heart of berlin next to the brandenburg gate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the memorial for the murdered jews in europe in central berlin .
the memorial consisting of 2,751 concrete slabs will be inaugurated may 10 , 2005 .
unflinching acceptance this unflinching willingness to accept responsibility for the past is part of the reason why germany 's role in europe is so different than that of japan 's in asia .
today france and germany are joined by deep friendship while china and japan are currently confronted by bubbling animosity toward each other over resurfacing issues stemming from the war .
the contrast could n't be any starker : as angry chinese protestors were demolishing japanese shops and pelting tokyo 's embassy in recent weeks , french president jacques chirac enlisted german chancellor gerhard schröder to help him rally support for the upcoming french referendum on the eu constitution .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schröder , left , is greeted by french president jacques chirac at the elysee palace in paris .
anyone that has doubts about the european project needs to stop and think about that for a minute .
sixty years after the war , paris is betting a german can convince average frenchmen what is good for france .
even ten years ago that would have been unthinkable .
back then , german officials were largely ignored during the 50th wwii anniversary celebrations .
but this year things are different .
chancellor schröder 's presence at a ceremony in moscow marking the end of the war is generally viewed as a sign of irreversible reconciliation in europe .
a decade 's difference much has changed in ten years - including both how the world views germany and how germany views itself .
in 1995 , a newly reunified germany was still a shy economic giant , unsure of its place in the world .
a decade later , the country is firmly anchored at the center of an enlarged eu and berlin has become more confident about playing a bigger role on the global stage .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soldiers of germany 's kfor troops carry riot protection shields during an exercise in prizren , kosovo .
though controversial in germany at the time , few actions have shown the changing nature of the country 's wwii legacy better than berlin 's decision to help intervene militarily in kosovo to stop serbian ethnic cleansing in 1999 .
at the time , it nearly caused schröder 's center-left coalition of social democrats and pacifist greens to collapse .
but both the chancellor and his greens foreign minister , joschka fischer , realized that if germany were to ever sanction military force , there could be no better reason than to halt the sort of crimes against humanity that the nazis once committed in the balkans .
there can be few greater signs of germany coming to terms with its history than of a democratic government in berlin willing to put the nation 's soldiers in harm 's way to keep others from repeating german mistakes .
continuing down the path despite how far germany has come in 60 years , there is still some way to go , however .
last autumn 's regional elections in the eastern state of saxony did considerable damage to germany 's image after the neo-nazi npd party won nearly 10 percent of the vote .
the newly-elected npd representatives then went on to disgrace themselves and the rest of germany in january by walking out of saxony 's parliament during a moment of silence meant to honor the victims of the nazis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters of the far right-wing national democratic party npd walk infront of the frauenkirche church of our lady and carry flags of their party during their rally through dresden , eastern germany , sunday , feb .
13 , 2005 .
60 years ago , on february 13th and 14th , 1945 , allied forces air raids on dresden destroyed the town and left the city in ruins .
as long as germany 's economy remains plagued by weak growth and high unemployment , there will always be the danger of right-wing extremists will playing on peoples ' fears for their own gains .
but if germany forever wants to rid itself of political bottom-feeders like the npd , the country will also have to redefine what it means to be german .
the more conservative parts of germany society still generally consider being " german " as something defined by ethnicity rather than the more abstract cultural concept of citizenship that america , britain and france have developed .
this is a pity .
modern germany is a multicultural nation firmly based on the principles of equality , solidarity and tolerance , which could easily apply to first-generation turkish immigrants as well as bavarians and berliners . marc young , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de far-right german party belittles holocaust a week before europe hosts a series of memorial services in honor of the freeing of auschwitz , a group of far-right german politicians caused a stir by walking out on a state ceremony for nazi victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 09.05.2005 gladbach stays on top großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg 's daun scored to help his club stay in the bundesliga as a result of a 2-1 victory against bochum , nuremberg have assured themselves a spot in the first bundesliga next season .
mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

the event was clouded by a debate over moscow 's postwar behavior . a spectacular parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier , after an airborne flypast . russian jets left the white , red and white colors of the russian flag hanging in the sky over red square after the hour-long parade , the centerpiece of commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany . bildunterschrift : soldiers marching during the parade 's dress rehearsal sunday over 50 world leaders attended the lavish parade including german chancellor gerhard schröder and us president george w. bush , who sat next to russian host vladimir putin . in his keynote speech , putin vowed to ensure that there would never be a repeat of either the cold war or a real war . putin also hailed reconciliation between russia and germany as " one of the most important post-war achievements " in europe . " faced with today 's real threats of terrorism , we must remain faithful to the memory of our fathers , " he said .
" we must defend a world order based on security and justice , on a new culture of mutual relations which do not allow any repetition of either cold wars or hot wars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- center -rrb- with russia 's president putin and putin 's wife rain which had threatened to overshadow the ceremonies held off as the parade got underway , also watched by ranks of veterans in full regalia who were among the privileged guests .
while the official program centers on commemorating the allied victory 60 years ago , it is the unscripted crescendo of recriminations between russia and the many countries it dominated from the end of the war until recently , that may determine how this week 's events are remembered .
bush 's latvia trip deepens tensions the parade had been clouded by stormy debate over moscow 's post-war occupation of central and eastern europe . diplomatic exchanges reached a fever pitch as bush visited latvia ahead of his trip to russia , with leaders of the three ex-soviet baltic republics demanding that moscow apologize for postwar soviet occupation of their countries and putin saying moscow had done enough already . bildunterschrift : bush with baltic leaders : estonia 's president arnold rüütel , lithuania 's president valdas adamkus and latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga on saturday in a letter to latvian president vaira vike-freiberga prior to his arrival in riga , bush expressed sympathy with the grievances of former soviet-bloc states in eastern europe .
for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken . " it is precisely this point - the notion that the soviet union in fact " liberated " anyone at all after defeating the nazis - that has reignited latent passions in europe , rekindled historical debate and as a result , to an extent , subverted russia 's v-day celebration even before it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalin is still honored by some russia , reeling not just from the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but from continuing anti-moscow " revolts " in its nearest neighbors and trying to retain a measure of coherence in its own state , appears uninterested in any more expressions of regret for its 20th-century past . " it makes you want to ask : what would have happened to you if we had n't broken the backbone of fascism ?
would your people be among the living today ? "
russian defense minister sergei ivanov said in an interview with the daily rossiyskaya gazeta published wednesday . conciliatory tones speaking to german media last week , however , putin seemed to strike a more conciliatory note .
the soviet takeover of the baltics , he said , was a " tragedy " for the baltic peoples , but the former soviet leadership had already repudiated a 1939 secret deal with nazi germany that let it happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife at the tomb of the unknown soldier in moscow on monday and in an article published in the russian daily komsomolskaya pravda on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder asked for " forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans . " " for no other country was the cost of victory over hitler 's germany so high as for the peoples of the soviet union , " he wrote .
" losses of over 26 million people and indescribable destruction were the frightening result of world war ii for the former soviet union . " dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president : we will never forget german president köhler urged germans sunday to keep alive the memories of the suffering inflicted by nazi germany . " we germans look back with horror and shame , " he said during the wwii commemoration in parliament .

the vast memorial was built between 1946 and 1949 as a burial site for some 5000 red army soldiers killed during the battle for berlin .
the russian ambassador lay wreaths to honour the soviet troops who fought in world war two .
speaking before red army veterans he said may 8 1945 marked the victory of civilisation over barbarianism .
on monday , may 9 , all eyes will be on moscow as world leaders fly to the russian capital to take part in lavish ceremonies marking the end of wwii .
in an e-mail interview , vladimir kotenev briefly told dw-world his thoughts about the significant occasion .
what is the significance of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war for russia today ?
this date is , without exaggeration , holy for every russian .
the victory over fascism 60 years ago was a deed of the whole of progressive humankind , though the soviet union made the decisive contribution .
our country paid a very high price for the victory : 27 million dead , including 18 million civilian victims ; 33,000 cities and villages were completely destroyed .
still , we weathered the war and won .
may 9 is thus both an occasion for pride as well as a day of remembrance with tears in our eyes for us .
what political conclusions does russia draw from world war ii today ?
do russia 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's current foreign policy , and if so , how ?
even today the results of world war ii have an important affect on the modern world order as well as the norms according to which the states - including russia explicitly - orient themselves in the international arena .
these norms include , firstly , the strict observation of international law ; secondly , the leading role of the un , meaning the global mechanism for the fortification of peace and security in the world which was established as a result of the war ; thirdly , the decisive opposition to powers that propagate the superiority and exclusiveness of an ideology , race , nationality or religion .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence russian politics , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
today 's germany is a country that , according to our opinion , drew the right conclusions from the tragedy of world war ii .
it created mechanisms that prevented repetition of the past .
and it has admitted its guilt .
this germany is our strategic partner , with whom we are connected by joint or similar positions on the fundamental international questions .
exactly for that reason we will receive chancellor gerhard schröder as our friend and partner at the commemorative ceremonies on may 9 in moscow . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president : we will never forget germany is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the nazi surrender in wwii sunday with celebrations of its hard-won democracy , but the day threatens to be overshadowed by a major neo-nazi protest .

"
the writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain . managing life 's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in schiller 's works .
the artist himself was a prime example as he showed how the mind can triumph over a sick body for most of his life . schiller 's fever attacks often became so severe that rumors of his death spread frequently .
but again and again he managed to leave his sick bed and return to the writing desk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller statue in berlin " when he finally died , the duke said , ' let 's cut him open , " ' wrote schiller 's biographer , rüdiger safranski .
doctors had long considered the writer a medical phenomenon : due to his medical history , they felt he should have died much earlier . but " one should call it idealism , when someone manages to live 10 years longer than the body would permit simply because of the power of enthusiasm and mind , " safranski wrote . a dominating duke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birth house -lrb- center -rrb- in marbach schiller was born on nov .
10 , 1759 in marbach on the neckar in southwestern germany .
his father worked as an army doctor for duke karl eugen of württemberg .
his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper .
while in school , schiller wanted to become a priest , but the duke prevented this .
in 1773 , he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy .
as his father served in the army , it was a request he could n't refuse . the school turned out to be hell for schiller , who suffered under the strict regimen .
to deal with the pressure , he began to write - first poems , followed by the play " the robbers " in 1777 .
while secretly working on the play , he also wrote a medical dissertation . the latter was finished in 1780 , the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on jan .
13 , 1783 .
schiller 's passionate plea for freedom turned " the robbers " into a sensational success and made him the " poet of peace . " fleeing his homeland needless to say , the duke was n't thrilled about schiller 's lust for liberty and banned him from writing .
schiller responded by fleeing his homeland in 1782 , making his living as a freelance writer from then on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant he quickly wrote " fiesco , " " love and intrigue " and " don carlos " and crisscrossed germany - partly to escape the duke 's wrath , partly to find new sources of funding .
in 1787 , in the eastern german town of jena , he first learned about kant 's philosophy , which influenced him tremendously .
he also met his future wife , charlotte von lengefeld , in jena . the french revolution of 1789 fascinated schiller - after all , it was about liberty .
but its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history .
during the following years , he almost completely gave up literary writing and focussed on historical-philosophical research instead . a world-famous friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jena 's university today in 1790 , he settled in jena , where he taught history at the university .
a year later , the newly-wed poet fell ill with pneumonia , which later caused him almost unbearable pain as it led to a suppuration of the pleura , the pericardium and his kidneys . in 1794 , schiller began a friendship with johann wolfgang von goethe , which took on a central role in the lives of both poets and became a highlight of germany 's literary history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller memorial in weimar goethe encouraged schiller to write again and together , they composed the famous " xenia " satirical poems .
in 1799 , schiller moved to weimar to be closer to goethe , only to fall sick again one year later .
as a medical doctor , schiller realized that he did n't have much time left and set out to complete the works that were to make him famous around the globe : " wilhelm tell , " the wallenstein trilogy , " mary stuart , " and the " maid of orleans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 09.05.2005 russia 's day of remembrance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian wwii veterans on the eve of moscow 's pomp-filled celebration russians ' suffering during wwii was immeasurable .
little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .
russia 's favorite holiday during soviet times , the bombastic may 9 parade was n't merely an expression of communist propaganda meant to document the superiority of the soviet system .
bildunterschrift : russian borderguards march during a dress rehearsal of the victory parade on the outskirts of moscow .
the festivities also met a need the people felt , as war veterans or eyewitnesses who endured the hardships on the home front belonged to nearly every family .
thus , even for postwar generations , there was a private aspect to the anniversary .
today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .
after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .
17 , 1917 in the face of little protest .
limited historical perspective but , the enormous symbolic power of the " day of victory " and its steadfast rituals keep russian society from critically analyzing the past .
on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , in 1995 , the poklonnaya gora memorial was unveiled in moscow not in commemoration of world war ii but , in soviet tradition , in honor of the " great patriotic war 1941-1945 . "
as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly-decorated russian war veterans thus , since last year , world war ii veterans no longer take part in the parade .
instead , army associations , veterans of the wars in afghanistan and chechnya and emergency ministry troops parade across red square . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .

little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .
russia 's favorite holiday during soviet times , the bombastic may 9 parade was n't merely an expression of communist propaganda meant to document the superiority of the soviet system .
bildunterschrift : russian borderguards march during a dress rehearsal of the victory parade on the outskirts of moscow .
the festivities also met a need the people felt , as war veterans or eyewitnesses who endured the hardships on the home front belonged to nearly every family .
thus , even for postwar generations , there was a private aspect to the anniversary .
today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .
after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .
17 , 1917 in the face of little protest .
limited historical perspective but , the enormous symbolic power of the " day of victory " and its steadfast rituals keep russian society from critically analyzing the past .
on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , in 1995 , the poklonnaya gora memorial was unveiled in moscow not in commemoration of world war ii but , in soviet tradition , in honor of the " great patriotic war 1941-1945 . "
as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly-decorated russian war veterans thus , since last year , world war ii veterans no longer take part in the parade .
instead , army associations , veterans of the wars in afghanistan and chechnya and emergency ministry troops parade across red square . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .

in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .
17 , 1917 in the face of little protest .
limited historical perspective but , the enormous symbolic power of the " day of victory " and its steadfast rituals keep russian society from critically analyzing the past .
on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , in 1995 , the poklonnaya gora memorial was unveiled in moscow not in commemoration of world war ii but , in soviet tradition , in honor of the " great patriotic war 1941-1945 . "
as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .

after another week of juices , he said his body had adjusted to the food-free life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-indulging ?
" i ca n't explain it , either , " werner told the tabloid , adding that he even put on weight since switching to natural light as his source of nutrition .
" apparently light energy can be turned into nutrition if one really believes it . " werner claims that he now drinks about 1.5 liters -lrb- about 3 pints -rrb- of water , juices , tea or coffee each day . but even bild , which loves a good sensation , had to get a second opinion on the matter . " i do n't believe that 's possible , " helmut oberritter , the scientific director of the german society for nutrition , told the paper , adding that werner must lack proteins and fatty acids . more light , anyone ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a dossier of previous " and finally ...

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .

finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial .

and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .

" werner , a chemist from the central german city of braunschweig , claims that he has not eaten a thing for the past four years .

after another week of juices , he said his body had adjusted to the food-free life . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over-indulging ?
" i ca n't explain it , either , " werner told the tabloid , adding that he even put on weight since switching to natural light as his source of nutrition .
" apparently light energy can be turned into nutrition if one really believes it . " werner claims that he now drinks about 1.5 liters -lrb- about 3 pints -rrb- of water , juices , tea or coffee each day . but even bild , which loves a good sensation , had to get a second opinion on the matter . " i do n't believe that 's possible , " helmut oberritter , the scientific director of the german society for nutrition , told the paper , adding that werner must lack proteins and fatty acids . more light , anyone ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a dossier of previous " and finally ...

the writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain . managing life 's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in schiller 's works .

his father worked as an army doctor for duke karl eugen of württemberg .
his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper .
while in school , schiller wanted to become a priest , but the duke prevented this .
in 1773 , he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy .
as his father served in the army , it was a request he could n't refuse . the school turned out to be hell for schiller , who suffered under the strict regimen .
to deal with the pressure , he began to write - first poems , followed by the play " the robbers " in 1777 .
while secretly working on the play , he also wrote a medical dissertation . the latter was finished in 1780 , the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on jan .

schiller 's passionate plea for freedom turned " the robbers " into a sensational success and made him the " poet of peace . " fleeing his homeland needless to say , the duke was n't thrilled about schiller 's lust for liberty and banned him from writing .
schiller responded by fleeing his homeland in 1782 , making his living as a freelance writer from then on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant he quickly wrote " fiesco , " " love and intrigue " and " don carlos " and crisscrossed germany - partly to escape the duke 's wrath , partly to find new sources of funding .
in 1787 , in the eastern german town of jena , he first learned about kant 's philosophy , which influenced him tremendously .
he also met his future wife , charlotte von lengefeld , in jena . the french revolution of 1789 fascinated schiller - after all , it was about liberty .
but its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history .
during the following years , he almost completely gave up literary writing and focussed on historical-philosophical research instead . a world-famous friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jena 's university today in 1790 , he settled in jena , where he taught history at the university .
a year later , the newly-wed poet fell ill with pneumonia , which later caused him almost unbearable pain as it led to a suppuration of the pleura , the pericardium and his kidneys . in 1794 , schiller began a friendship with johann wolfgang von goethe , which took on a central role in the lives of both poets and became a highlight of germany 's literary history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller memorial in weimar goethe encouraged schiller to write again and together , they composed the famous " xenia " satirical poems .
in 1799 , schiller moved to weimar to be closer to goethe , only to fall sick again one year later .

the event was clouded by a debate over moscow 's postwar behavior . a spectacular parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier , after an airborne flypast . russian jets left the white , red and white colors of the russian flag hanging in the sky over red square after the hour-long parade , the centerpiece of commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany . bildunterschrift : soldiers marching during the parade 's dress rehearsal sunday over 50 world leaders attended the lavish parade including german chancellor gerhard schröder and us president george w. bush , who sat next to russian host vladimir putin . in his keynote speech , putin vowed to ensure that there would never be a repeat of either the cold war or a real war . putin also hailed reconciliation between russia and germany as " one of the most important post-war achievements " in europe . " faced with today 's real threats of terrorism , we must remain faithful to the memory of our fathers , " he said .
" we must defend a world order based on security and justice , on a new culture of mutual relations which do not allow any repetition of either cold wars or hot wars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- center -rrb- with russia 's president putin and putin 's wife rain which had threatened to overshadow the ceremonies held off as the parade got underway , also watched by ranks of veterans in full regalia who were among the privileged guests .
while the official program centers on commemorating the allied victory 60 years ago , it is the unscripted crescendo of recriminations between russia and the many countries it dominated from the end of the war until recently , that may determine how this week 's events are remembered .
bush 's latvia trip deepens tensions the parade had been clouded by stormy debate over moscow 's post-war occupation of central and eastern europe . diplomatic exchanges reached a fever pitch as bush visited latvia ahead of his trip to russia , with leaders of the three ex-soviet baltic republics demanding that moscow apologize for postwar soviet occupation of their countries and putin saying moscow had done enough already . bildunterschrift : bush with baltic leaders : estonia 's president arnold rüütel , lithuania 's president valdas adamkus and latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga on saturday in a letter to latvian president vaira vike-freiberga prior to his arrival in riga , bush expressed sympathy with the grievances of former soviet-bloc states in eastern europe .
for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken . " it is precisely this point - the notion that the soviet union in fact " liberated " anyone at all after defeating the nazis - that has reignited latent passions in europe , rekindled historical debate and as a result , to an extent , subverted russia 's v-day celebration even before it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalin is still honored by some russia , reeling not just from the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but from continuing anti-moscow " revolts " in its nearest neighbors and trying to retain a measure of coherence in its own state , appears uninterested in any more expressions of regret for its 20th-century past . " it makes you want to ask : what would have happened to you if we had n't broken the backbone of fascism ?
would your people be among the living today ? "
russian defense minister sergei ivanov said in an interview with the daily rossiyskaya gazeta published wednesday . conciliatory tones speaking to german media last week , however , putin seemed to strike a more conciliatory note .
the soviet takeover of the baltics , he said , was a " tragedy " for the baltic peoples , but the former soviet leadership had already repudiated a 1939 secret deal with nazi germany that let it happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife at the tomb of the unknown soldier in moscow on monday and in an article published in the russian daily komsomolskaya pravda on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder asked for " forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans . " " for no other country was the cost of victory over hitler 's germany so high as for the peoples of the soviet union , " he wrote .
" losses of over 26 million people and indescribable destruction were the frightening result of world war ii for the former soviet union .

little wonder then that even today the " day of victory " over nazi-germany is celebrated lavishly .
but the showy symbolism leaves no room for critical assessment . it 's become a tradition for russia to have a huge celebration to commemorate the german army 's surrender in 1945 - on may 9 . since stalin 's days , the ritual has always been the same : on the " day of victory , " army units and war veterans parade through red square in moscow .
at lenin 's mausoleum , the country 's power elite make speeches .
but elsewhere in russia , too , throughout the country the people 's grave suffering is commemorated in innumerable memorial ceremonies .
russia 's favorite holiday during soviet times , the bombastic may 9 parade was n't merely an expression of communist propaganda meant to document the superiority of the soviet system .
bildunterschrift : russian borderguards march during a dress rehearsal of the victory parade on the outskirts of moscow .
the festivities also met a need the people felt , as war veterans or eyewitnesses who endured the hardships on the home front belonged to nearly every family .
thus , even for postwar generations , there was a private aspect to the anniversary .
today too , russians value celebrating the " day of victory " extraordinarily highly .
after new year 's day , may 9 is the holiday they most appreciate , polls have shown .
in 2004 , around 60 percent of russians said they actually celebrate the " day of victory . "
more than 70 percent saw it as the most important day of commemoration and wanted it to remain a holiday .
in contrast , president putin was able to abolish the holiday commemorating the bolshevik takeover on nov .
17 , 1917 in the face of little protest .
limited historical perspective but , the enormous symbolic power of the " day of victory " and its steadfast rituals keep russian society from critically analyzing the past .
on the 50th anniversary of the war 's end , in 1995 , the poklonnaya gora memorial was unveiled in moscow not in commemoration of world war ii but , in soviet tradition , in honor of the " great patriotic war 1941-1945 . "
as a result , ignorance and the stereotypical soviet interpretation of history dominate among a large part of russian society .
that 's the case when it comes to stalin 's support for the german invasion of poland -lrb- the hitler-stalin pact -rrb- ; the brutal occupation of the baltic countries , poland and bessarabia from 1939-1941 ; the soviet leadership 's gross misjudgment of the german attack on the ussr that led to high losses and thousands of prisoners of war ; as well as the horrible suffering that german , polish , ukrainian and other civilians experienced during the red army 's advance towards berlin .
and it certainly applies to the fact that soviet soldiers did indeed liberate the central european countries from the german occupiers , but at the same time , they occupied them and installed stalinist regimes there .
soviet victory as a post-soviet tool the policies and culture of russian presidents yeltsin and putin also explain the distortion of memory .
they rule out any critical analysis in their speeches .
on the contrary , they use many russians ' patriotic sensitivities on the " day of victory " to appeal for unity among the population .
russian society 's social and ethnic strife , the pain of losing the soviet empire and threats of terrorism make the victory during world war ii into a sustainable political tool .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : highly-decorated russian war veterans thus , since last year , world war ii veterans no longer take part in the parade .
instead , army associations , veterans of the wars in afghanistan and chechnya and emergency ministry troops parade across red square . ingo mannteufel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush ruffles russian feathers the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital .

the event was clouded by a debate over moscow 's postwar behavior . a spectacular parade commemorating the end of world war ii closed on monday with world leaders paying tribute at the tomb of the unknown soldier , after an airborne flypast . russian jets left the white , red and white colors of the russian flag hanging in the sky over red square after the hour-long parade , the centerpiece of commemorations of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of nazi germany . bildunterschrift : soldiers marching during the parade 's dress rehearsal sunday over 50 world leaders attended the lavish parade including german chancellor gerhard schröder and us president george w. bush , who sat next to russian host vladimir putin . in his keynote speech , putin vowed to ensure that there would never be a repeat of either the cold war or a real war . putin also hailed reconciliation between russia and germany as " one of the most important post-war achievements " in europe . " faced with today 's real threats of terrorism , we must remain faithful to the memory of our fathers , " he said .
" we must defend a world order based on security and justice , on a new culture of mutual relations which do not allow any repetition of either cold wars or hot wars . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush -lrb- center -rrb- with russia 's president putin and putin 's wife rain which had threatened to overshadow the ceremonies held off as the parade got underway , also watched by ranks of veterans in full regalia who were among the privileged guests .
while the official program centers on commemorating the allied victory 60 years ago , it is the unscripted crescendo of recriminations between russia and the many countries it dominated from the end of the war until recently , that may determine how this week 's events are remembered .
bush 's latvia trip deepens tensions the parade had been clouded by stormy debate over moscow 's post-war occupation of central and eastern europe . diplomatic exchanges reached a fever pitch as bush visited latvia ahead of his trip to russia , with leaders of the three ex-soviet baltic republics demanding that moscow apologize for postwar soviet occupation of their countries and putin saying moscow had done enough already . bildunterschrift : bush with baltic leaders : estonia 's president arnold rüütel , lithuania 's president valdas adamkus and latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga on saturday in a letter to latvian president vaira vike-freiberga prior to his arrival in riga , bush expressed sympathy with the grievances of former soviet-bloc states in eastern europe .
for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken . " it is precisely this point - the notion that the soviet union in fact " liberated " anyone at all after defeating the nazis - that has reignited latent passions in europe , rekindled historical debate and as a result , to an extent , subverted russia 's v-day celebration even before it began . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stalin is still honored by some russia , reeling not just from the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 but from continuing anti-moscow " revolts " in its nearest neighbors and trying to retain a measure of coherence in its own state , appears uninterested in any more expressions of regret for its 20th-century past . " it makes you want to ask : what would have happened to you if we had n't broken the backbone of fascism ?
would your people be among the living today ? "
russian defense minister sergei ivanov said in an interview with the daily rossiyskaya gazeta published wednesday . conciliatory tones speaking to german media last week , however , putin seemed to strike a more conciliatory note .
the soviet takeover of the baltics , he said , was a " tragedy " for the baltic peoples , but the former soviet leadership had already repudiated a 1939 secret deal with nazi germany that let it happen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder and his wife at the tomb of the unknown soldier in moscow on monday and in an article published in the russian daily komsomolskaya pravda on sunday , german chancellor gerhard schröder asked for " forgiveness for the suffering inflicted upon the russian people and other peoples at the hands of germans and in the name of germans . " " for no other country was the cost of victory over hitler 's germany so high as for the peoples of the soviet union , " he wrote .

"
the writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain . managing life 's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in schiller 's works .
the artist himself was a prime example as he showed how the mind can triumph over a sick body for most of his life . schiller 's fever attacks often became so severe that rumors of his death spread frequently .

his father worked as an army doctor for duke karl eugen of württemberg .
his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper .
while in school , schiller wanted to become a priest , but the duke prevented this .
in 1773 , he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy .
as his father served in the army , it was a request he could n't refuse . the school turned out to be hell for schiller , who suffered under the strict regimen .
to deal with the pressure , he began to write - first poems , followed by the play " the robbers " in 1777 .
while secretly working on the play , he also wrote a medical dissertation . the latter was finished in 1780 , the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on jan .

schiller 's passionate plea for freedom turned " the robbers " into a sensational success and made him the " poet of peace . " fleeing his homeland needless to say , the duke was n't thrilled about schiller 's lust for liberty and banned him from writing .

he also met his future wife , charlotte von lengefeld , in jena . the french revolution of 1789 fascinated schiller - after all , it was about liberty .
but its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history .

a year later , the newly-wed poet fell ill with pneumonia , which later caused him almost unbearable pain as it led to a suppuration of the pleura , the pericardium and his kidneys . in 1794 , schiller began a friendship with johann wolfgang von goethe , which took on a central role in the lives of both poets and became a highlight of germany 's literary history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller memorial in weimar goethe encouraged schiller to write again and together , they composed the famous " xenia " satirical poems .
in 1799 , schiller moved to weimar to be closer to goethe , only to fall sick again one year later .

" it 's appropriate that germany remembers those that were displaced from -lrb- the country 's -rrb- former eastern regions , " he said .
" but this does n't mean that people should foster a victims ' culture .
germany was responsible for the outbreak of world war ii . " blair added that the world must never forget the horrors that took place between 1939 and 1945 , but said that former enemies had now become friends . " britain and germany have played a leading role in the development of europe as a continent of peace and prosperity , " he said .
" scars may remain , but the wounds have healed . " partners and allies the british leader also said that he saw germany as a partner and ally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar hamann " we cooperate in all areas of life , " he said .

" our soldiers stand shoulder to shoulder in kosovo and afghanistan .
our relations have never been better . " beware complacency blair also said that he did n't believe a dictatorship like that of the nazis could reoccur in europe . " but we must not get complacent , " he said .
" yugoslavia during the 1990s proved that barbarian acts are still possible on our continent . " a pragmatic eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair after a meeting at the eu summit in brussels , friday march 21 , 2003 talking about europe 's unification , blair said that he supported a european union that concentrated on the needs of its citizens but rejected integration for its own sake . " we have to combine our resources where it makes sense - fighting crime , establishing a common market , protecting the environment , fighting illegal immigration , " he said . but blair added that nation states should have the last word in areas where they were most suited to make decisions . " that 's the case with fiscal and foreign policy , " he said .
" that 's the european union as laid out in the constitution treaty .
it 's a pragmatic , practical european union , which looks after the needs of europe 's citizens .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .

their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .

the vast memorial was built between 1946 and 1949 as a burial site for some 5000 red army soldiers killed during the battle for berlin .
the russian ambassador lay wreaths to honour the soviet troops who fought in world war two .
speaking before red army veterans he said may 8 1945 marked the victory of civilisation over barbarianism .
on monday , may 9 , all eyes will be on moscow as world leaders fly to the russian capital to take part in lavish ceremonies marking the end of wwii .
in an e-mail interview , vladimir kotenev briefly told dw-world his thoughts about the significant occasion .
what is the significance of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war for russia today ?
this date is , without exaggeration , holy for every russian .
the victory over fascism 60 years ago was a deed of the whole of progressive humankind , though the soviet union made the decisive contribution .
our country paid a very high price for the victory : 27 million dead , including 18 million civilian victims ; 33,000 cities and villages were completely destroyed .
still , we weathered the war and won .
may 9 is thus both an occasion for pride as well as a day of remembrance with tears in our eyes for us .
what political conclusions does russia draw from world war ii today ?
do russia 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's current foreign policy , and if so , how ?
even today the results of world war ii have an important affect on the modern world order as well as the norms according to which the states - including russia explicitly - orient themselves in the international arena .
these norms include , firstly , the strict observation of international law ; secondly , the leading role of the un , meaning the global mechanism for the fortification of peace and security in the world which was established as a result of the war ; thirdly , the decisive opposition to powers that propagate the superiority and exclusiveness of an ideology , race , nationality or religion .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence russian politics , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
today 's germany is a country that , according to our opinion , drew the right conclusions from the tragedy of world war ii .
it created mechanisms that prevented repetition of the past .
and it has admitted its guilt .
this germany is our strategic partner , with whom we are connected by joint or similar positions on the fundamental international questions .
exactly for that reason we will receive chancellor gerhard schröder as our friend and partner at the commemorative ceremonies on may 9 in moscow . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president : we will never forget germany is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the nazi surrender in wwii sunday with celebrations of its hard-won democracy , but the day threatens to be overshadowed by a major neo-nazi protest .

the vast memorial was built between 1946 and 1949 as a burial site for some 5000 red army soldiers killed during the battle for berlin .
the russian ambassador lay wreaths to honour the soviet troops who fought in world war two .
speaking before red army veterans he said may 8 1945 marked the victory of civilisation over barbarianism .
on monday , may 9 , all eyes will be on moscow as world leaders fly to the russian capital to take part in lavish ceremonies marking the end of wwii .
in an e-mail interview , vladimir kotenev briefly told dw-world his thoughts about the significant occasion .
what is the significance of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war for russia today ?
this date is , without exaggeration , holy for every russian .
the victory over fascism 60 years ago was a deed of the whole of progressive humankind , though the soviet union made the decisive contribution .
our country paid a very high price for the victory : 27 million dead , including 18 million civilian victims ; 33,000 cities and villages were completely destroyed .
still , we weathered the war and won .
may 9 is thus both an occasion for pride as well as a day of remembrance with tears in our eyes for us .
what political conclusions does russia draw from world war ii today ?
do russia 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's current foreign policy , and if so , how ?
even today the results of world war ii have an important affect on the modern world order as well as the norms according to which the states - including russia explicitly - orient themselves in the international arena .
these norms include , firstly , the strict observation of international law ; secondly , the leading role of the un , meaning the global mechanism for the fortification of peace and security in the world which was established as a result of the war ; thirdly , the decisive opposition to powers that propagate the superiority and exclusiveness of an ideology , race , nationality or religion .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence russian politics , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
today 's germany is a country that , according to our opinion , drew the right conclusions from the tragedy of world war ii .
it created mechanisms that prevented repetition of the past .
and it has admitted its guilt .
this germany is our strategic partner , with whom we are connected by joint or similar positions on the fundamental international questions .
exactly for that reason we will receive chancellor gerhard schröder as our friend and partner at the commemorative ceremonies on may 9 in moscow . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german president : we will never forget germany is commemorating the 60th anniversary of the nazi surrender in wwii sunday with celebrations of its hard-won democracy , but the day threatens to be overshadowed by a major neo-nazi protest .

mönchengladbach also managed to secure its position , practically sealing bochum 's fate . last season , the fans of bochum feted peter neururer as a hero .
after all , bochum made it to the uefa cup for just the second time in the club 's history .
but after the club 's heartbreaking exit from the competition in the first round , the bundesliga season turned into a nightmare .
and the nightmare has become reality after a 2-1 defeat at the hands of nuremberg .
mönchengladbach 's draw on sunday with hamburg sv granted bochum their fifth visit to the second division since 1993 , with möchengladbach more or less securing their position in the bundesliga .
the team was indebted to goalkeeper kasey keller , who demonstrated his skill with a fingertip save when emile mpenza saw his chance in the third minute .
keller managed to keep hamburg 's forwards at bay throughout the match , which ended 0-0 .
also on sunday , borussia dortmund took a first-half lead against werder bremen , thanks to a goal by tomas rosicky , and continued to hold them off for a 1-0 win , hurting bremen 's chances of making it back into the champions league .
bremen 's johan micoud missed two good chances and mohamed zidan nearly scored with a deflected shot in the game 's last minute .
nerves showing most of the match nuremberg were also all but clear of the relegation zone heading into this important match .
yes , they were six points ahead of bochum , but stranger things have happened in the last weeks of a bundesliga season .
they did n't want that to happen against bochum .
and it showed , in the first 20 minutes , neither side could get untracked .
nuremberg proved to be a little more professional in their passing while bochum could seldom string more than two passes together .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heads up : nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- right -rrb- wins a headball duel against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc finally , nuremberg won a duel at midfield and marek mintal found striker markus daun all alone at the midfield circle .
he raced down alone to the bochum net , just managed to get the ball past keeper peter skov-jensen .
the ball bounced off the left post and into the net .
bochum were not shocked at falling behind .
it 's a situation they have been accustomed to this season .
they could n't crack the nuremberg defense which had fallen back into its own end - also nothing new for bochum this season .
more action in the second-half the precarious situation of the ruhr valley club was quite obvious entering the second half .
yet they could take heart in the fact that other clubs threatened by relegation , namely mainz and rostock , were also down in their matches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't keep good friends apart : again nuremberg 's marek nikl -lrb- back -rrb- goes up against bochum 's vratislav lokvenc nevertheless , bochum remained calm .
in the first 15 minutes , both teams played cautiously .
bochum did not want to fall behind by two goals too soon .
for nuremberg the clock was simply their friend .
bochum 's striker edu then had the golden opportunity in the 72nd minute when he received a long pass inside the bochum penalty box but nuremberg 's keeper raphael schäfer made a great save to prevent the equalizer - and new life for bochum .
the near-goal gave bochum incentive to try harder , to push ahead .
and that was exactly what nuremberg was betting on .
in the 84th minute , bochum were caught too far up front .
nuremberg took advantage of this with ice in their veins on a three-against-two chance .
marek mintal showed just why he is the league 's leading goal scorer and coolly scored his 23rd goal of the season .
that was the death knell for bochum who then managed to score a consolation goal in injury time .
mainz to stay in bundesliga bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mainz ' benjamin weigelt -lrb- right -rrb- ca n't stop munich 's roy makaay .
makaay would score twice to shoot down mainz who despite the loss are the winners of the day - they are staying in the first division next season along with nuremberg , new boys mainz are staying in the bundesliga despite a 4-2 loss at the hands of champions bayern munich .
their coach jürgen klopp got a beer shower after a game that his side contested hotly in the first hour but roy makaay found the net twice in the last 30 minutes to make it clear to mainz that bayern plays a level of soccer a notch above the rest of the bundesliga competition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 09.05.2005 the sorrows of young schiller großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strong mind , sick body german icon friedrich schiller died 200 years ago on monday - an anniversary marked in weimar with the opening of a special " schiller year . "
the writer died at age 45 and wrote many of his works in physical pain . managing life 's inevitable hardships is a recurring theme in schiller 's works .
the artist himself was a prime example as he showed how the mind can triumph over a sick body for most of his life . schiller 's fever attacks often became so severe that rumors of his death spread frequently .
but again and again he managed to leave his sick bed and return to the writing desk . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller statue in berlin " when he finally died , the duke said , ' let 's cut him open , " ' wrote schiller 's biographer , rüdiger safranski .
doctors had long considered the writer a medical phenomenon : due to his medical history , they felt he should have died much earlier . but " one should call it idealism , when someone manages to live 10 years longer than the body would permit simply because of the power of enthusiasm and mind , " safranski wrote . a dominating duke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiller 's birth house -lrb- center -rrb- in marbach schiller was born on nov .
10 , 1759 in marbach on the neckar in southwestern germany .
his father worked as an army doctor for duke karl eugen of württemberg .
his mother was the daughter of an innkeeper .
while in school , schiller wanted to become a priest , but the duke prevented this .
in 1773 , he ordered the teenager to attend his military academy .
as his father served in the army , it was a request he could n't refuse . the school turned out to be hell for schiller , who suffered under the strict regimen .
to deal with the pressure , he began to write - first poems , followed by the play " the robbers " in 1777 .
while secretly working on the play , he also wrote a medical dissertation . the latter was finished in 1780 , the play was published half a year later and finally premiered on jan .
13 , 1783 .
schiller 's passionate plea for freedom turned " the robbers " into a sensational success and made him the " poet of peace . " fleeing his homeland needless to say , the duke was n't thrilled about schiller 's lust for liberty and banned him from writing .
schiller responded by fleeing his homeland in 1782 , making his living as a freelance writer from then on . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immanuel kant he quickly wrote " fiesco , " " love and intrigue " and " don carlos " and crisscrossed germany - partly to escape the duke 's wrath , partly to find new sources of funding .
in 1787 , in the eastern german town of jena , he first learned about kant 's philosophy , which influenced him tremendously .
he also met his future wife , charlotte von lengefeld , in jena . the french revolution of 1789 fascinated schiller - after all , it was about liberty .
but its bloody course disappointed him and encouraged him to study history .
during the following years , he almost completely gave up literary writing and focussed on historical-philosophical research instead . a world-famous friendship bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jena 's university today in 1790 , he settled in jena , where he taught history at the university .
a year later , the newly-wed poet fell ill with pneumonia , which later caused him almost unbearable pain as it led to a suppuration of the pleura , the pericardium and his kidneys . in 1794 , schiller began a friendship with johann wolfgang von goethe , which took on a central role in the lives of both poets and became a highlight of germany 's literary history . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goethe and schiller memorial in weimar goethe encouraged schiller to write again and together , they composed the famous " xenia " satirical poems .
in 1799 , schiller moved to weimar to be closer to goethe , only to fall sick again one year later .
as a medical doctor , schiller realized that he did n't have much time left and set out to complete the works that were to make him famous around the globe : " wilhelm tell , " the wallenstein trilogy , " mary stuart , " and the " maid of orleans .

" i ca n't explain it , either , " werner told the tabloid , adding that he even put on weight since switching to natural light as his source of nutrition .
" apparently light energy can be turned into nutrition if one really believes it . " werner claims that he now drinks about 1.5 liters -lrb- about 3 pints -rrb- of water , juices , tea or coffee each day . but even bild , which loves a good sensation , had to get a second opinion on the matter . " i do n't believe that 's possible , " helmut oberritter , the scientific director of the german society for nutrition , told the paper , adding that werner must lack proteins and fatty acids . more light , anyone ? dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " click here for a dossier of previous " and finally ...

for them , he said , the end of world war ii " marked the soviet occupation and annexation " of the baltic states " and the imposition of communism " in much of central and eastern europe . the latvian leader said bush 's very presence in riga was an acknowledgment of the " double meaning " of the war . soviet losses according to fresh official figures , the soviet union lost 26.6 million people in four years of savage fighting with germany , far more than all other allied countries combined .
and it is the soviet union , many historians agree , that deserves the most credit for defeating the nazis . that is the message that putin aimed to get across . " our people did not just defend their own homeland - they liberated 11 european states , " he said on sunday .
" on the field of battle from the barents sea to the caucasus the aggressor 's military machine was broken .

the vast memorial was built between 1946 and 1949 as a burial site for some 5000 red army soldiers killed during the battle for berlin .
the russian ambassador lay wreaths to honour the soviet troops who fought in world war two .
speaking before red army veterans he said may 8 1945 marked the victory of civilisation over barbarianism .
on monday , may 9 , all eyes will be on moscow as world leaders fly to the russian capital to take part in lavish ceremonies marking the end of wwii .
in an e-mail interview , vladimir kotenev briefly told dw-world his thoughts about the significant occasion .
what is the significance of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war for russia today ?
this date is , without exaggeration , holy for every russian .
the victory over fascism 60 years ago was a deed of the whole of progressive humankind , though the soviet union made the decisive contribution .
our country paid a very high price for the victory : 27 million dead , including 18 million civilian victims ; 33,000 cities and villages were completely destroyed .
still , we weathered the war and won .
may 9 is thus both an occasion for pride as well as a day of remembrance with tears in our eyes for us .
what political conclusions does russia draw from world war ii today ?
do russia 's experiences of the second world war influence the country 's current foreign policy , and if so , how ?
even today the results of world war ii have an important affect on the modern world order as well as the norms according to which the states - including russia explicitly - orient themselves in the international arena .
these norms include , firstly , the strict observation of international law ; secondly , the leading role of the un , meaning the global mechanism for the fortification of peace and security in the world which was established as a result of the war ; thirdly , the decisive opposition to powers that propagate the superiority and exclusiveness of an ideology , race , nationality or religion .
sixty years after the war , how do you view germany today ?
how does the second world war influence russian politics , particularly in relation to germany in 2005 ?
today 's germany is a country that , according to our opinion , drew the right conclusions from the tragedy of world war ii .
it created mechanisms that prevented repetition of the past .
and it has admitted its guilt .
this germany is our strategic partner , with whom we are connected by joint or similar positions on the fundamental international questions .

deutsche welle spoke with the 68-year-old . no other german memorial has been the subject of such a long and agonizing debate as the 2,711 cement pillars , or steles , installed since 2003 on an expanse between the brandenburg gate , potsdamer platz and hitler 's former chancellery in central berlin .
in the beginning , it was not at all clear what the monument to europe 's six million murdered jews would look like .
then , in 1988 , historian eberhard jäckel suggested the idea to lea rosh while visiting the israeli holocaust memorial yad vashem . " we have to have something in germany that commemorates the murdered jews , " rosh quoted jäckel as saying .
" and i said to him , ' why ?
we do have something .
we have many -lrb- memorials -rrb- in germany , ' and i listed them .
and then eberhard said , ' that 's for the berlin jews or for the frankfurt jews or for those from hanover , but we do n't have anything in germany - and as far as i know there is nothing -lrb- anywhere -rrb- , except for yad vashem , that commemorates the murdered european jews ' . " rosh returned to berlin , where she headed a citizens ' initiative , and she posed the question to her group : did germany need a central monument commemorating the genocide of europe 's jews ?
" we discussed for a long time whether -lrb- it should be -rrb- exclusively for the jews or also for other groups of victims , and we decided exclusively for the jews , " rosh said .
bildunterschrift : part of the information center beneath the holocaust memorial it took four years for rosh attract the federal government 's attention .
finally , then-chancellor helmut kohl gave the idea his blessing .
rosh set out to quickly realize the idea , a monument she was convinced should be located in a highly visible location in berlin .
she expected to be confronted with resistance from within german society , but she never imagined that the project would take 17 years to be completed .
letting go " i thought , it 's fully clear that we must erect a monument in berlin for the murdered european jews , " rosh said .
" and i told my board of directors : ' we 'll have it in three to four years , or else we 'll let it go . '
but the ' we 'll let it go ' part was n't so easy after all .
we had collected signatures , many signatures ; we had collected money , within two to three years 100,000 deutsche marks -lrb- 51,000 euros , $ 66,000 -rrb- in 100 mark notes , but also 20 marks , 10 marks or two marks , off the street .
and then you ca n't just say after four years we 're going to let it all go now .
besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

besides , we felt we owed it to the victims .
so , we kept at it , year for year .
but that it would take 17 years until the unveiling - naturally we never expected that . " even so , rosh says she 's glad germany debated the issue .
she credits the sometimes heated public discussion with generating a candor about topic that she claims would n't have developed otherwise .
but it 's an open question whether unveiling the monument designed by new york architect peter eisenman will put an end to the debate .
bildunterschrift : an aerial view of the berlin monument to the victims of the holocaust keeping it lively rosh is hopeful that the monument will not only keep the memory of the holocaust 's victims alive but that the debate will remain lively too , when , for example , school classes from germany or abroad visit the memorial . " we do a lot of tours through the monument site and talk with groups of visitors .
and there 's an enormous amount of interest , especially among young people .
they want to know exactly how it was , how it was possible , who collaborated , who refused .
and those are such interesting discussions that i believe the monument will be a trigger for many people to really thoroughly delve into the topic .
that 's why we do especially like to do these tours . " the tours include visits to the underground documentation center beneath the monument .

thirty-five years earlier , the octogenarian ex-labour mp so davies also upset the party 's applecart , that time in neighbouring merthyr tydfil .
both results suggest traditional labour voters will readily switch support from the party to a popular local figure .
the unanswered question is whether will they " go home " to labour so easily .
mr law pulled off the shock result of the general election by turning labour 's 19,000 majority into a 9,000-vote majority of his own in the seat he also represents in the welsh assembly . "
so and peter law are similar in that there is this feeling of ' look , you people outside ca n't simply ride roughshod over us " ' commentator patrick hannan but as the new independent socialist mp for blaenau gwent prepares to take his seat in westminster , he can look back at a similar achievement by so davies in 1970 .
stephen owen davies - always known as so - had been labour mp for merthyr since 1934 when the local party decided he was too old to stand again .
officially he was 84 at the time , although there were rumours that he was actually closer to 90 .
but he refused to retire and decided to stand as an independent when labour chose union official tal lloyd as the official candidate to defend his 17,000 majority . "
he had been semi-detached for years .
he just carried on doing what he 'd always done " glyn mathias in a striking echo of blaenau gwent 2005 , the merthyr 1970 result saw so romp home as an independent socialist by 7,400 votes .
however , the country never had the chance to see whether so could repeat his success .
he died two years later and at the subsequent by-election labour regained the seat , albeit against a strong plaid cymru vote .
homburg hat political commentator patrick hannan said one of the reasons he did well was that there had been a dispute at merthyr 's hoover factory - the town 's major employer - and disgruntled workers felt their mp had been badly treated .

thirty-five years earlier , the octogenarian ex-labour mp so davies also upset the party 's applecart , that time in neighbouring merthyr tydfil .
both results suggest traditional labour voters will readily switch support from the party to a popular local figure .
the unanswered question is whether will they " go home " to labour so easily .
mr law pulled off the shock result of the general election by turning labour 's 19,000 majority into a 9,000-vote majority of his own in the seat he also represents in the welsh assembly .
so and peter law are similar in that there is this feeling of ' look , you people outside ca n't simply ride roughshod over us ' commentator patrick hannan but as the new independent socialist mp for blaenau gwent prepares to take his seat in westminster , he can look back at a similar achievement by so davies in 1970 .
stephen owen davies - always known as so - had been labour mp for merthyr since 1934 when the local party decided he was too old to stand again .
officially he was 84 at the time , although there were rumours that he was actually closer to 90 .
but he refused to retire and decided to stand as an independent when labour chose union official tal lloyd as the official candidate to defend his 17,000 majority .
he had been semi-detached for years .
he just carried on doing what he 'd always done glyn mathias in a striking echo of blaenau gwent 2005 , the merthyr 1970 result saw so romp home as an independent socialist by 7,400 votes .
however , the country never had the chance to see whether so could repeat his success .
he died two years later and at the subsequent by-election labour regained the seat , albeit against a strong plaid cymru vote .
homburg hat political commentator patrick hannan said one of the reasons he did well was that there had been a dispute at merthyr 's hoover factory - the town 's major employer - and disgruntled workers felt their mp had been badly treated .
" he was , of course , sort of ostracised -lrb- by labour -rrb- , " said mr hannan .
so davies ' election message in the 1934 by-election when he first became an mp " but the only time i spoke to him he told me ' i do get the whip , you know ' .
unlike peter law , they all had been colleagues in westminster and i do n't think they would n't speak to him or anything like that .
" he was obviously being given the information he needed and was voting with the labour party .
" he was a peculiar figure who referred to himself in the third person .
he would say ' so davies did this or so davies did that . '
" he also looked as if he belonged to a different age , in his parliamentary " uniform " of homburg hat , silk scarf , black jacket and pin-striped trousers .

terrence ' banjo ' bannon , 35 , from newry , is to climb to the summit of the notorious k2 .
he plans to make the climb without assistance or oxygen .
if successful , he will be the first irish climber ever to get to the top of the so-called " mountain of mountains ' as a solo climb , on one of the world 's most treacherous peaks , his attempt on k2 will be his toughest challenge .
an irish team will accompany him on the expedition to base camp .
they plan to set out in june and mr bannon hopes to reach the top by the end of july 2005 .
over the years , k2 has been called the " savage mountain " and " a death trap " .
fifty-one years ago on 31 july , two italian climbers , lino lacedelli and achille compagnoni , braved wind , rain and storm to climb the second highest - and arguably - most dangerous mountain in the world .
dangerous feat despite improvements in technology , the mountain is considered as dangerous today as it was then .
it has a much higher rate of fatalities than everest .
two years ago , mr bannon and his team-mate new zealander jamie mcguinness , 37 , reached the top of the world 's highest peak , everest , on 31 may .
it was the first time a team from northern ireland had reached the summit and followed the success of an irish team earlier in the month .
speaking at the time of that conquest , he described it as " a great sensation " , but admitted that there were setbacks as he neared the top which made him think he might have to turn back .
it took the pair nine hours to climb the final 500 metres of everest , using oxygen supplies and head torches to guide them .

terrence ' banjo ' bannon , 35 , from newry , is to climb to the summit of the notorious k2 .
he plans to make the climb without assistance or oxygen .
if successful , he will be the first irish climber ever to get to the top of the so-called " mountain of mountains ' as a solo climb , on one of the world 's most treacherous peaks , his attempt on k2 will be his toughest challenge .
an irish team will accompany him on the expedition to base camp .
they plan to set out in june and mr bannon hopes to reach the top by the end of july 2005 .
over the years , k2 has been called the " savage mountain " and " a death trap " .
fifty-one years ago on 31 july , two italian climbers , lino lacedelli and achille compagnoni , braved wind , rain and storm to climb the second highest - and arguably - most dangerous mountain in the world .
dangerous feat despite improvements in technology , the mountain is considered as dangerous today as it was then .
it has a much higher rate of fatalities than everest .
two years ago , mr bannon and his team-mate new zealander jamie mcguinness , 37 , reached the top of the world 's highest peak , everest , on 31 may .
it was the first time a team from northern ireland had reached the summit and followed the success of an irish team earlier in the month .
speaking at the time of that conquest , he described it as " a great sensation " , but admitted that there were setbacks as he neared the top which made him think he might have to turn back .
it took the pair nine hours to climb the final 500 metres of everest , using oxygen supplies and head torches to guide them .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- the assault on software giant microsoft home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 9 may , 2005 , 07:14 gmt 08:14 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version the assault on software giant microsoft analysis by tim weber business editor , bbc news website the next two years will be crucial for software giant microsoft .
under attack on numerous fronts , it could falter - or fight back to become even more dominant .
in the first of two reports , we examine the challenges facing microsoft .
look closely : the bedroom mirror hides a computer monitor it looks like a star trek gadget : nudge the stubby black stick -lrb- no wires -rrb- and a virtual keyboard glitters in red on the kitchen worktop .
after a few taps , the shopping list is sent to an online grocer .
next you could video-conference with a friend to swap recipes , or watch a cooking show stored on the hard drive of the media hub in the living room .
upstairs , the mirror on the bedroom wall becomes a monitor , allowing you to watch a film , browse the web - or turn up the heating and open the blinds .
welcome to microsoft 's wireless " m.home " , on a leafy street in london 's ladbroke grove .
microsoft is in its most vulnerable moment in history , just like ibm in the 1990s george colony , forrester " this is not the home of the future , " says cynthia crossley , who is in charge of microsoft 's windows operating system in the uk .
" all the technology can be bought off-the-shelf and fits subtly into your home . "
driven by microsoft 's media center software , the showcase home lends credibility to the promise of microsoft boss bill gates that in a few years ' time his company will deliver a " user-centric " digital world .
reality check alas , the m.home is a far cry from real life : where few computers link up to hi-fi and television , where complex software , hardware and competing media formats drive users to despair , and where setting up wireless home networks is a black art .
microsoft hq : redmond , washington sales : $ 36bn -lrb- 2004 -rrb- profits : $ 8.2bn -lrb- 2004 -rrb- staff : 57,000 founded : 1975 chairman : bill gates chief executive : steven ballmer security is another issue .
millions of computers running microsoft 's windows operating system are under constant virus attack and riddled with spyware .
microsoft , meanwhile , finds itself hassled by ever more competitors .
" microsoft is in its most vulnerable moment in history , just like ibm in the 1990s , " says george colony , the chief executive of technology research firm forrester .
vulnerable ?
the company whose software powers more than 90 % of all the world 's personal computers ?
linux and friends microsoft may have a monopoly right now , says mr colony , but " protection of a monopoly is tricky " .
and there are plenty of challengers ready to put microsoft 's durability to the test .
foremost among them is the linux operating system .
linus torvalds wrote the original code for linux rivalling windows , this " open source " software project is developed by an online community of volunteers , but backed by big and small corporate players -lrb- like ibm and red hat -rrb- who provide support and tailor the software for individual business needs .
linux , its champions say , is more stable and secure than anything microsoft has ever produced .
it is cheap - even free if you are computer-savvy enough to install and maintain it - and much more customisable , because the code that makes it tick is neither a secret nor copyrighted by a single firm .
these days linux is not just the software of choice for geeks ; recently even the stolid bureaucrats of bavaria 's capital munich decided to switch all their computers to linux .
china , south korea and japan , meanwhile , have joined forces to develop an asian flavour of linux , to ensure they are not in thrall to microsoft .
other parts of the empire are under attack too , such as the hugely profitable " office " suite .
do n't want to pay for a word processor , spreadsheet , database and presentation tool ?
download openoffice .
it wo n't look as nice as office 2003 , but it 's free and fully featured .
editing pictures ?
you do n't have to pay for microsoft 's " image suite " .
the open source " gimp " is powerful , while google 's free picasa will meet the everyday needs of most consumers .
the browser war bill gates promises great things for " the third decade of windows " microsoft 's biggest worry , though , should be the huge success of mozilla firefox , the open source web browser .
faster and more secure than internet explorer , it is the first browser to seriously challenge microsoft 's dominance .
in just nine months firefox has chalked up 50 million downloads , although some are admittedly upgrades .
bill gates is one of the people with firefox on his computer , so i asked him for his opinion .
" i played around with it a bit , but it 's just another browser , and ie -lsb- microsoft 's internet explorer -rsb- is better , " mr gates told me , and challenged my assertion that firefox 's ' market share ' is growing rapidly .
" so much software gets downloaded all the time , but do people actually use it ? " he argued .
apple takes a bite in this fast-moving technology market , microsoft 's biggest problem may be its very size .
will the ipod generation go on to buy apple computers ?
" microsoft is not an innovator or transformer right now , " says forrester 's george colony .
many rivals are more focused and nimble .
take a company like skype with its software for free internet telephony , successfully invading the turf of microsoft 's msn messenger .
or long-term rival apple , whose ipod media player and itunes music store have thrown microsoft 's music ambitions into disarray .
and even giants like mobile phone maker nokia give microsoft a run for its money , pushing their own mobile software into the pockets of millions of consumers .
microsoft squeezed " companies are not afraid of competing with microsoft anymore , " says marc benioff , the boss of salesforce.com , which offers a service over the internet which competes with microsoft in the lucrative market for " customer relationship management " software .
" microsoft is a great business ... but people do n't want big software applications any more , " he claims .
it also works for consumers .
why use microsoft if you have a broadband connection and combine firefox with powerful web services like google 's gmail ?
here is microsoft 's problem : while rivals try to pick off its software offering one by one , new ways of writing software - for example open source - speed up the pace of innovation and threaten microsoft 's business model .

welcome to microsoft 's wireless " m.home " , on a leafy street in london 's ladbroke grove .

millions of computers running microsoft 's windows operating system are under constant virus attack and riddled with spyware .
microsoft , meanwhile , finds itself hassled by ever more competitors .
" microsoft is in its most vulnerable moment in history , just like ibm in the 1990s , " says george colony , the chief executive of technology research firm forrester .
vulnerable ?
the company whose software powers more than 90 % of all the world 's personal computers ?
linux and friends microsoft may have a monopoly right now , says mr colony , but " protection of a monopoly is tricky " .
and there are plenty of challengers ready to put microsoft 's durability to the test .
foremost among them is the linux operating system .
linus torvalds wrote the original code for linux rivalling windows , this " open source " software project is developed by an online community of volunteers , but backed by big and small corporate players -lrb- like ibm and red hat -rrb- who provide support and tailor the software for individual business needs .
linux , its champions say , is more stable and secure than anything microsoft has ever produced .
it is cheap - even free if you are computer-savvy enough to install and maintain it - and much more customisable , because the code that makes it tick is neither a secret nor copyrighted by a single firm .
these days linux is not just the software of choice for geeks ; recently even the stolid bureaucrats of bavaria 's capital munich decided to switch all their computers to linux .
china , south korea and japan , meanwhile , have joined forces to develop an asian flavour of linux , to ensure they are not in thrall to microsoft .
other parts of the empire are under attack too , such as the hugely profitable " office " suite .
do n't want to pay for a word processor , spreadsheet , database and presentation tool ?
download openoffice .
it wo n't look as nice as office 2003 , but it 's free and fully featured .
editing pictures ?
you do n't have to pay for microsoft 's " image suite " .
the open source " gimp " is powerful , while google 's free picasa will meet the everyday needs of most consumers .
the browser war bill gates promises great things for " the third decade of windows " microsoft 's biggest worry , though , should be the huge success of mozilla firefox , the open source web browser .
faster and more secure than internet explorer , it is the first browser to seriously challenge microsoft 's dominance .
in just nine months firefox has chalked up 50 million downloads , although some are admittedly upgrades .
bill gates is one of the people with firefox on his computer , so i asked him for his opinion .
" i played around with it a bit , but it 's just another browser , and ie -lsb- microsoft 's internet explorer -rsb- is better , " mr gates told me , and challenged my assertion that firefox 's ' market share ' is growing rapidly .
" so much software gets downloaded all the time , but do people actually use it ? " he argued .
apple takes a bite in this fast-moving technology market , microsoft 's biggest problem may be its very size .
will the ipod generation go on to buy apple computers ?
" microsoft is not an innovator or transformer right now , " says forrester 's george colony .
many rivals are more focused and nimble .
take a company like skype with its software for free internet telephony , successfully invading the turf of microsoft 's msn messenger .
or long-term rival apple , whose ipod media player and itunes music store have thrown microsoft 's music ambitions into disarray .
and even giants like mobile phone maker nokia give microsoft a run for its money , pushing their own mobile software into the pockets of millions of consumers .
microsoft squeezed " companies are not afraid of competing with microsoft anymore , " says marc benioff , the boss of salesforce.com , which offers a service over the internet which competes with microsoft in the lucrative market for " customer relationship management " software .
" microsoft is a great business ... but people do n't want big software applications any more , " he claims .
it also works for consumers .
why use microsoft if you have a broadband connection and combine firefox with powerful web services like google 's gmail ?
here is microsoft 's problem : while rivals try to pick off its software offering one by one , new ways of writing software - for example open source - speed up the pace of innovation and threaten microsoft 's business model .
bill gates wants to push microsoft into the mobile space the fate of " longhorn " is a case in point .
the much-heralded successor to windows xp is badly delayed and key components wo n't be ready for launch .
" we are working hard to get it on the market in 2006 and scale our ambitions to fit with that , " mr gates admits .
thus users will have to wait until 2007 for longhorn 's revolutionary filing system , designed to help find information buried in ever larger hard drives .

linux and friends microsoft may have a monopoly right now , says mr colony , but " protection of a monopoly is tricky " .
and there are plenty of challengers ready to put microsoft 's durability to the test .
foremost among them is the linux operating system .
linus torvalds wrote the original code for linux rivalling windows , this " open source " software project is developed by an online community of volunteers , but backed by big and small corporate players -lrb- like ibm and red hat -rrb- who provide support and tailor the software for individual business needs .
linux , its champions say , is more stable and secure than anything microsoft has ever produced .
it is cheap - even free if you are computer-savvy enough to install and maintain it - and much more customisable , because the code that makes it tick is neither a secret nor copyrighted by a single firm .
these days linux is not just the software of choice for geeks ; recently even the stolid bureaucrats of bavaria 's capital munich decided to switch all their computers to linux .
china , south korea and japan , meanwhile , have joined forces to develop an asian flavour of linux , to ensure they are not in thrall to microsoft .
other parts of the empire are under attack too , such as the hugely profitable " office " suite .
do n't want to pay for a word processor , spreadsheet , database and presentation tool ?
download openoffice .
it wo n't look as nice as office 2003 , but it 's free and fully featured .
editing pictures ?
you do n't have to pay for microsoft 's " image suite " .
the open source " gimp " is powerful , while google 's free picasa will meet the everyday needs of most consumers .
the browser war bill gates promises great things for " the third decade of windows " microsoft 's biggest worry , though , should be the huge success of mozilla firefox , the open source web browser .
faster and more secure than internet explorer , it is the first browser to seriously challenge microsoft 's dominance .
in just nine months firefox has chalked up 50 million downloads , although some are admittedly upgrades .
bill gates is one of the people with firefox on his computer , so i asked him for his opinion .
" i played around with it a bit , but it 's just another browser , and ie -lsb- microsoft 's internet explorer -rsb- is better , " mr gates told me , and challenged my assertion that firefox 's ' market share ' is growing rapidly .
" so much software gets downloaded all the time , but do people actually use it ? " he argued .
apple takes a bite in this fast-moving technology market , microsoft 's biggest problem may be its very size .
will the ipod generation go on to buy apple computers ?
" microsoft is not an innovator or transformer right now , " says forrester 's george colony .
many rivals are more focused and nimble .
take a company like skype with its software for free internet telephony , successfully invading the turf of microsoft 's msn messenger .
or long-term rival apple , whose ipod media player and itunes music store have thrown microsoft 's music ambitions into disarray .
and even giants like mobile phone maker nokia give microsoft a run for its money , pushing their own mobile software into the pockets of millions of consumers .
microsoft squeezed " companies are not afraid of competing with microsoft anymore , " says marc benioff , the boss of salesforce.com , which offers a service over the internet which competes with microsoft in the lucrative market for " customer relationship management " software .
" microsoft is a great business ... but people do n't want big software applications any more , " he claims .
it also works for consumers .
why use microsoft if you have a broadband connection and combine firefox with powerful web services like google 's gmail ?
here is microsoft 's problem : while rivals try to pick off its software offering one by one , new ways of writing software - for example open source - speed up the pace of innovation and threaten microsoft 's business model .
bill gates wants to push microsoft into the mobile space the fate of " longhorn " is a case in point .
the much-heralded successor to windows xp is badly delayed and key components wo n't be ready for launch .
" we are working hard to get it on the market in 2006 and scale our ambitions to fit with that , " mr gates admits .
thus users will have to wait until 2007 for longhorn 's revolutionary filing system , designed to help find information buried in ever larger hard drives .
once ready it will be deployed as part of a longhorn service pack , says alistair baker , boss of microsoft uk .
but apple 's brand-new " os x tiger " operating system offers this kind of functionality today .
add microsoft 's ongoing trouble with regulators - the company is already talking to us authorities about longhorn - and the picture of a rich but troubled company is complete .
forrester boss george colony predicts that there will be " a crisis at microsoft , where they decide their model is broken " .
but remember netscape , which dominated the internet - only for microsoft to catch up .
bill gates has a clear strategy .
his company has very deep pockets .
and his fightback starts now .

under attack on numerous fronts , it could falter - or fight back to become even more dominant .
in the first of two reports , we examine the challenges facing microsoft .
it looks like a star trek gadget : nudge the stubby black stick -lrb- no wires -rrb- and a virtual keyboard glitters in red on the kitchen worktop .
after a few taps , the shopping list is sent to an online grocer .
next you could video-conference with a friend to swap recipes , or watch a cooking show stored on the hard drive of the media hub in the living room .
upstairs , the mirror on the bedroom wall becomes a monitor , allowing you to watch a film , browse the web - or turn up the heating and open the blinds .
welcome to microsoft 's wireless " m.home " , on a leafy street in london 's ladbroke grove . "
microsoft is in its most vulnerable moment in history , just like ibm in the 1990s " george colony , forrester " this is not the home of the future , " says cynthia crossley , who is in charge of microsoft 's windows operating system in the uk .
" all the technology can be bought off-the-shelf and fits subtly into your home . "
driven by microsoft 's media center software , the showcase home lends credibility to the promise of microsoft boss bill gates that in a few years ' time his company will deliver a " user-centric " digital world .
reality check alas , the m.home is a far cry from real life : where few computers link up to hi-fi and television , where complex software , hardware and competing media formats drive users to despair , and where setting up wireless home networks is a black art .
microsoft hq : redmond , washington sales : $ 36bn -lrb- 2004 -rrb- profits : $ 8.2bn -lrb- 2004 -rrb- staff : 57,000 founded : 1975 chairman : bill gates chief executive : steven ballmer security is another issue .
millions of computers running microsoft 's windows operating system are under constant virus attack and riddled with spyware .
microsoft , meanwhile , finds itself hassled by ever more competitors .
" microsoft is in its most vulnerable moment in history , just like ibm in the 1990s , " says george colony , the chief executive of technology research firm forrester .

previous palm d 'or winners gus van sant , lars von trier , wim wenders and the dardenne brothers are back to lock horns for the most prestigious prize in film .
and with a-list stars like scarlett johansson , ewan mcgregor , samuel jackson and natalie portman expected to attend , the glamour count on the riviera is sure to be as high as ever .
the festival will also play host to the world premiere of the final star wars prequel , episode iii : revenge of the sith .
nick james , editor of the british film institute 's sight and sound magazine , told the bbc news website it was a " resonating " list of directors in competition .
the selection is the choice of cannes ' artistic director thierry fremaux , who is at the helm of the festival for the second time .
' mixed bag ' " the list of people are names that cannes has favoured often , " james said .
" when thierry fremaux took over , he said he was moving away from this .

" it 's a long list of prestigious names .

james mooted lars von trier 's manderlay , and last days by gus van sant as likely " talking points " of the festival .
van sant won the palme d 'or in 2003 for his film elephant , which was based on the columbine school shootings in 1999 .
cannes 2005 in numbers 58th annual festival 1540 feature films submitted 53 films showing 28 countries represented 50 world premières 20 feature films in competition for palme d 'or his latest offering , last days , is loosely based on nirvana frontman kurt cobain , who shot himself in april 1994 .
von trier - whose dancer in the dark film took the festival 's top prize in 2000 - is in the official selection this year with manderlay .
other big names in the frame include david cronenberg , with a history of violence ; and robert rodiguez , who is in the running with sin city .
james described sin city as an " extraordinary technical achievement " , but added it was controversial cronenberg who intrigued him the most .
it has been over 20 years since wenders won worldwide acclaim - including the palme d 'or - with paris , texas , the story of a drifter making peace with his turbulent past .
he is in competition this year with do n't come knocking , starring jessica lange and sam shepard .
meanwhile , jean-pierre and luc dardenne are hoping to impress the cannes jury with l 'enfant - a film about coming to terms with fatherhood .
james admitted he was " less excited " by actor tommy lee jones who makes his directorial debut with the three burials of melquiades estrada .
james said : " i may be wrong , but often when an actor makes their directorial debut , it 's usually an uncomfortable scene , so i do n't expect it to be that great . "
' important market ' but while 13 different countries - including iraq - are represented in competition this year , the uk is not one of them .
" there are no british films , simply because we are not making any , and that is very sad , " james added .
ian thompson , of the uk film council , said while the uk was not represented in competition , cannes remained an significant date on the film industry calendar .
he told the bbc news website : " cannes is two different worlds .
as well as the festival itself , the cannes market is very important , especially for the british film industry .
" i think for the british film industry as a whole , cannes is going to be a very important market .
there are a lot of films to sell and a lot of important films coming up . "
lars von trier won the palme d 'or in 2000 mr thompson said there would be " 40 or 50 " uk films for sale at this year 's festival , including stoned - about the life and death of rolling stones co-founder brian jones - and the contented gardener , starring ralph fiennes and rachel weisz .
he said it was more of a crucial time than ever to be selling british talent abroad .
" the government 's current commitment to film tax relief has made the industry very nervous and that has made it more important then ever to be at cannes . "
mr thompson added it was also more important for the uk film industry to be making films that were successful at the box office , than films that won prizes .
" when you look at recent palme d 'or winners , only fahrenheit 9/11 and pulp fiction have made a real impact .
" there is less concern in the industry to win the palme d 'or , than make a film that is a success at the box office . "

woody allen has abandoned his natural location of manhattan and headed to london in his latest film match point , starring scarlett johansson .

he is in competition this year with do n't come knocking , starring jessica lange and sam shepard .
meanwhile , jean-pierre and luc dardenne are hoping to impress the cannes jury with l 'enfant - a film about coming to terms with fatherhood .
james admitted he was " less excited " by actor tommy lee jones who makes his directorial debut with the three burials of melquiades estrada .
james said : " i may be wrong , but often when an actor makes their directorial debut , it 's usually an uncomfortable scene , so i do n't expect it to be that great . "
' important market ' but while 13 different countries - including iraq - are represented in competition this year , the uk is not one of them .
" there are no british films , simply because we are not making any , and that is very sad , " james added .
ian thompson , of the uk film council , said while the uk was not represented in competition , cannes remained an significant date on the film industry calendar .
he told the bbc news website : " cannes is two different worlds .
as well as the festival itself , the cannes market is very important , especially for the british film industry .
" i think for the british film industry as a whole , cannes is going to be a very important market .
there are a lot of films to sell and a lot of important films coming up . "
lars von trier won the palme d 'or in 2000 mr thompson said there would be " 40 or 50 " uk films for sale at this year 's festival , including stoned - about the life and death of rolling stones co-founder brian jones - and the contented gardener , starring ralph fiennes and rachel weisz .
he said it was more of a crucial time than ever to be selling british talent abroad .
" the government 's current commitment to film tax relief has made the industry very nervous and that has made it more important then ever to be at cannes . "
mr thompson added it was also more important for the uk film industry to be making films that were successful at the box office , than films that won prizes .
" when you look at recent palme d 'or winners , only fahrenheit 9/11 and pulp fiction have made a real impact .
" there is less concern in the industry to win the palme d 'or , than make a film that is a success at the box office . "
new city but while uk film-makers may not be on the lips of many at cannes , all eyes will be on london as it takes centre stage in one of the main out of competition films .
woody allen has abandoned his natural location of manhattan and headed to london in his latest film match point , starring scarlett johansson .
it will be shown at the festival on 12 may , with allen and johansson expected to be there .
james added : " woody has been under par of late , but maybe being in a different city will bring something completely different . "
