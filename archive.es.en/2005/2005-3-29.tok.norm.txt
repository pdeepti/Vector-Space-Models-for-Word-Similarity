a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer that also has to do with the fact that many european countries - and especially the new members - use nato as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it .
for , the united states is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together .
all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .
in that respect , the idea of intervention troops that can be quickly deployed , which nato is now pursuing , has n't changed much , since that is not where the problems in cooperating lay .
alliance or not , national intelligence agencies do n't work closely enough together .
although the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks caused nato partners to close ranks , petty jealousy and mistrust continue to hamper the exchange of information .
but close cooperation of the part of intelligence agencies is indispensable to prevent terror .
and it could give nato as an alliance a new and , above all , forward-looking course . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .

all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .

a meeting this week between the us candidate to head the world bank , paul wolfowitz , and eu ministers is set to be low key but various sources agree that the european union wants a strengthened voice in the world body . the informal meeting due to be held in brussels by the end of the week between wolfowitz and european governors of the world bank , who in general are finance ministers , is to be off-limits to the press , a source close to the current luxembourg presidency of european union ministerial meetings said .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker will host the meeting , according to reuters news service . one european source said that the meeting might be held on wednesday afternoon before a vote of all administrators of the world bank to be held in washington on thursday . europe resigned to wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder during the february meeting in mainz at an eu summit here a week ago , european leaders signaled that they were resigned to the nomination of wolfowitz by washington to head the world bank , which concentrates on long-term development projects , support and advice for developing countries .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund . " the newspaper said that european finance ministers had discussed at their meeting last weekend " the need for a similar arrangement at the bank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf headquarters in washington traditionally , europe chooses the managing director of the imf and the united states appoints the head of the world bank .
the informal rule has never been broken since the two institutions were set up in the wake of world war ii .
while the us holds 16 percent of shares and votes in the world bank , europe has 30 percent . a european deputy ? germany reportedly took the view that wolfowitz could himself appoint a european to head his team but that britain was skeptical about any deal that excluded developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has appeared receptive to this line of thinking .
he told the washington post on sunday that that he did not see a problem in appointing a european to an important position within the bank . last week belgian finance minister didier reynders also suggested that one of the posts of vice president at the bank be filled by a european . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .

he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .

the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund .

a meeting this week between the us candidate to head the world bank , paul wolfowitz , and eu ministers is set to be low key but various sources agree that the european union wants a strengthened voice in the world body . the informal meeting due to be held in brussels by the end of the week between wolfowitz and european governors of the world bank , who in general are finance ministers , is to be off-limits to the press , a source close to the current luxembourg presidency of european union ministerial meetings said .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund .

while the us holds 16 percent of shares and votes in the world bank , europe has 30 percent . a european deputy ? germany reportedly took the view that wolfowitz could himself appoint a european to head his team but that britain was skeptical about any deal that excluded developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has appeared receptive to this line of thinking .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .

they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .

" the students and their parents ask how such a thing is possible , above all , in our world today , after the political changes , after our president yushchenko was in brussels and met with chancellor gerhard schröder and joschka fischer in early march . " it remains doubtful whether those questions will ever be answered .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .

" the students and their parents ask how such a thing is possible , above all , in our world today , after the political changes , after our president yushchenko was in brussels and met with chancellor gerhard schröder and joschka fischer in early march .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer that also has to do with the fact that many european countries - and especially the new members - use nato as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it .
for , the united states is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together .
all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .
in that respect , the idea of intervention troops that can be quickly deployed , which nato is now pursuing , has n't changed much , since that is not where the problems in cooperating lay .
alliance or not , national intelligence agencies do n't work closely enough together .
although the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks caused nato partners to close ranks , petty jealousy and mistrust continue to hamper the exchange of information .
but close cooperation of the part of intelligence agencies is indispensable to prevent terror .
and it could give nato as an alliance a new and , above all , forward-looking course . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

it is supposed to safeguard elections in afghanistan , and keep peace in the country until 2006 .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer that also has to do with the fact that many european countries - and especially the new members - use nato as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it .
for , the united states is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together .
all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .
in that respect , the idea of intervention troops that can be quickly deployed , which nato is now pursuing , has n't changed much , since that is not where the problems in cooperating lay .
alliance or not , national intelligence agencies do n't work closely enough together .
although the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks caused nato partners to close ranks , petty jealousy and mistrust continue to hamper the exchange of information .
but close cooperation of the part of intelligence agencies is indispensable to prevent terror .
and it could give nato as an alliance a new and , above all , forward-looking course . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .

" the students and their parents ask how such a thing is possible , above all , in our world today , after the political changes , after our president yushchenko was in brussels and met with chancellor gerhard schröder and joschka fischer in early march .

a meeting this week between the us candidate to head the world bank , paul wolfowitz , and eu ministers is set to be low key but various sources agree that the european union wants a strengthened voice in the world body . the informal meeting due to be held in brussels by the end of the week between wolfowitz and european governors of the world bank , who in general are finance ministers , is to be off-limits to the press , a source close to the current luxembourg presidency of european union ministerial meetings said .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker will host the meeting , according to reuters news service . one european source said that the meeting might be held on wednesday afternoon before a vote of all administrators of the world bank to be held in washington on thursday . europe resigned to wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder during the february meeting in mainz at an eu summit here a week ago , european leaders signaled that they were resigned to the nomination of wolfowitz by washington to head the world bank , which concentrates on long-term development projects , support and advice for developing countries .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund . " the newspaper said that european finance ministers had discussed at their meeting last weekend " the need for a similar arrangement at the bank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf headquarters in washington traditionally , europe chooses the managing director of the imf and the united states appoints the head of the world bank .
the informal rule has never been broken since the two institutions were set up in the wake of world war ii .
while the us holds 16 percent of shares and votes in the world bank , europe has 30 percent . a european deputy ? germany reportedly took the view that wolfowitz could himself appoint a european to head his team but that britain was skeptical about any deal that excluded developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has appeared receptive to this line of thinking .
he told the washington post on sunday that that he did not see a problem in appointing a european to an important position within the bank . last week belgian finance minister didier reynders also suggested that one of the posts of vice president at the bank be filled by a european . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer that also has to do with the fact that many european countries - and especially the new members - use nato as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it .
for , the united states is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together .
all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .
in that respect , the idea of intervention troops that can be quickly deployed , which nato is now pursuing , has n't changed much , since that is not where the problems in cooperating lay .
alliance or not , national intelligence agencies do n't work closely enough together .
although the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks caused nato partners to close ranks , petty jealousy and mistrust continue to hamper the exchange of information .
but close cooperation of the part of intelligence agencies is indispensable to prevent terror .
and it could give nato as an alliance a new and , above all , forward-looking course . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer that also has to do with the fact that many european countries - and especially the new members - use nato as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it .

all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .

a meeting this week between the us candidate to head the world bank , paul wolfowitz , and eu ministers is set to be low key but various sources agree that the european union wants a strengthened voice in the world body . the informal meeting due to be held in brussels by the end of the week between wolfowitz and european governors of the world bank , who in general are finance ministers , is to be off-limits to the press , a source close to the current luxembourg presidency of european union ministerial meetings said .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker will host the meeting , according to reuters news service . one european source said that the meeting might be held on wednesday afternoon before a vote of all administrators of the world bank to be held in washington on thursday . europe resigned to wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder during the february meeting in mainz at an eu summit here a week ago , european leaders signaled that they were resigned to the nomination of wolfowitz by washington to head the world bank , which concentrates on long-term development projects , support and advice for developing countries .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund . " the newspaper said that european finance ministers had discussed at their meeting last weekend " the need for a similar arrangement at the bank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf headquarters in washington traditionally , europe chooses the managing director of the imf and the united states appoints the head of the world bank .
the informal rule has never been broken since the two institutions were set up in the wake of world war ii .
while the us holds 16 percent of shares and votes in the world bank , europe has 30 percent . a european deputy ? germany reportedly took the view that wolfowitz could himself appoint a european to head his team but that britain was skeptical about any deal that excluded developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has appeared receptive to this line of thinking .
he told the washington post on sunday that that he did not see a problem in appointing a european to an important position within the bank . last week belgian finance minister didier reynders also suggested that one of the posts of vice president at the bank be filled by a european . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .

she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .

each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .

" the students and their parents ask how such a thing is possible , above all , in our world today , after the political changes , after our president yushchenko was in brussels and met with chancellor gerhard schröder and joschka fischer in early march .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer that also has to do with the fact that many european countries - and especially the new members - use nato as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it .
for , the united states is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together .
all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .
in that respect , the idea of intervention troops that can be quickly deployed , which nato is now pursuing , has n't changed much , since that is not where the problems in cooperating lay .
alliance or not , national intelligence agencies do n't work closely enough together .
although the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks caused nato partners to close ranks , petty jealousy and mistrust continue to hamper the exchange of information .
but close cooperation of the part of intelligence agencies is indispensable to prevent terror .
and it could give nato as an alliance a new and , above all , forward-looking course . klaus dahmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder slammed over nato reform idea german chancellor gerhard schröder was heavily criticized on monday for urging an overhaul of nato , with some observers saying his remarks could damage ties with the united states .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .

" the students and their parents ask how such a thing is possible , above all , in our world today , after the political changes , after our president yushchenko was in brussels and met with chancellor gerhard schröder and joschka fischer in early march . " it remains doubtful whether those questions will ever be answered .

a meeting this week between the us candidate to head the world bank , paul wolfowitz , and eu ministers is set to be low key but various sources agree that the european union wants a strengthened voice in the world body . the informal meeting due to be held in brussels by the end of the week between wolfowitz and european governors of the world bank , who in general are finance ministers , is to be off-limits to the press , a source close to the current luxembourg presidency of european union ministerial meetings said .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker will host the meeting , according to reuters news service . one european source said that the meeting might be held on wednesday afternoon before a vote of all administrators of the world bank to be held in washington on thursday . europe resigned to wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder during the february meeting in mainz at an eu summit here a week ago , european leaders signaled that they were resigned to the nomination of wolfowitz by washington to head the world bank , which concentrates on long-term development projects , support and advice for developing countries .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund . " the newspaper said that european finance ministers had discussed at their meeting last weekend " the need for a similar arrangement at the bank .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .
for students in a country where the average monthly income is around 80 euros , that 's a lot of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yuschchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on march 9 " we do n't know what we 've done wrong , " said nedopjokina .
" the students and their parents ask how such a thing is possible , above all , in our world today , after the political changes , after our president yushchenko was in brussels and met with chancellor gerhard schröder and joschka fischer in early march . " it remains doubtful whether those questions will ever be answered .
but , for the time being , the university in dresden plans to work around the problems .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2005 ukrainian students feel visa scandal pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy is reluctant to even give language students visas the german foreign ministry 's liberal visa policy for east europeans has caused much controversy .
now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .
for students in a country where the average monthly income is around 80 euros , that 's a lot of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yuschchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on march 9 " we do n't know what we 've done wrong , " said nedopjokina .
" the students and their parents ask how such a thing is possible , above all , in our world today , after the political changes , after our president yushchenko was in brussels and met with chancellor gerhard schröder and joschka fischer in early march . " it remains doubtful whether those questions will ever be answered .
but , for the time being , the university in dresden plans to work around the problems .
until things settle down concerning issuing visas , the college will send language teachers to instruct students at the ukrainian university . christiane hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor possibly knew about visa row a scandal over lax visa policies that has dogged foreign minister joschka fischer for weeks has taken on a new twist after reports that chancellor gerhard schröder was allegedly fully aware of the issue for years .
-lrb- march 24 , 2005 -rrb- fischer : keep ukraine on path to europe speaking in kiev on monday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said the door to europe must remain open for ukraine , and urged leaders not to be influenced by the ongoing visa scandal in which he 's been implicated .
-lrb- march 21 , 2005 -rrb- an end to superstar fischer ?
foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2005 germans march for peace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in frankfurt called for more peace in the world some 50,000 people took to the streets in germany over the weekend to take part in the traditional easter peace marches .
activists protested against war , cutbacks in the social welfare system and the new eu constitution . the us-led war in iraq was the center of renewed criticism at germany 's easter peace marches in 65 cities across the country this year .
but participants also emphasized the drawbacks of the new european constitution , which must be approved by german lawmakers on may 12 .
" we want social equality and civil protection rather than pre-emptive war , as well as a democratic europe , " said willi van ooyen , spokesman for the organizers " informationsstelle ostermarsch . "
van ooyen said the diversity of participants reflected the lasting awareness of people interested in the peace movement to get involved in current political debates .
" never again fascism , never again war " the main demonstrations took place in berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , where the organizers are based .
the network of the german peace movement took a positive stock of the marches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in fretzdorf form the words " no bombs " " sixty years after the liberation of germany from hitler 's fascism and the end of the second world war , these demonstrations expressed the indissoluble consensus of the era : never again fascism , never again war , " the network 's director manfred stenner said in a statement .
he said the ongoing skepticism against war and the military in germany was also the merit of the postwar peace movement .
constitution committed to rearmament ?
the protests also drew attention to the new european constitution , which is currently in its ratification process across europe .
stenner said , though , that this criticism was not directed against europe 's integration , but rather because the draft " sets the course for rearmament and military adventure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution 's draft was presented during the eu summit in greece in june 2003 .
the peace march in the industrial ruhr basin focussed on those parts of the european constitution which , according to peace groups , encourage militarization .
they quoted article i-41 , which states : " member states shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities . "
" this is a commitment to rearmament on a constitutional level , " said felix oekentorp , spokesman of the ruhr easter march committee .
" this is unequalled worldwide and that alone is reason enough for us to say that this constitution draft is not acceptable for the peace movement . "
not mimic the united states european citizens should use the referendum process as an opportunity to lead an " intense discussion " about what kind of europe they want , said stenner .
" if the current constitution draft were to fail , peace initiatives and globalization opponents are hopeful that the basic principles of the european union will move more in the direction of social justness , greater commitment to peace politics and dealing with conflicts civilly , " he said .
if the referendums failed , european governments would have to rework the constitution .
" europe should n't strive to militarily mimic the superpower united states , " said stenner .
" rather , it should use its peacemaking policies to bridge the gap to southern countries , as well as to the islamic and arab world . "
the easter peace marches started in britain in the 1950s to call for nuclear disarmament .
since then , tens of thousands of people across europe take to the streets during easter .
in germany , the first march took place in 1960 .
they peaked in germany in 1983 , when 700,000 people protested against the installation of us pershing ii missiles in the country . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de analysts : france may blow eu constitution a poll published in france showed that 51 percent of french voters could vote " no " in a referendum on the european constitution .

" we want social equality and civil protection rather than pre-emptive war , as well as a democratic europe , " said willi van ooyen , spokesman for the organizers " informationsstelle ostermarsch . "
van ooyen said the diversity of participants reflected the lasting awareness of people interested in the peace movement to get involved in current political debates .
" never again fascism , never again war " the main demonstrations took place in berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , where the organizers are based .
the network of the german peace movement took a positive stock of the marches .

he said the ongoing skepticism against war and the military in germany was also the merit of the postwar peace movement .
constitution committed to rearmament ?
the protests also drew attention to the new european constitution , which is currently in its ratification process across europe .
stenner said , though , that this criticism was not directed against europe 's integration , but rather because the draft " sets the course for rearmament and military adventure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution 's draft was presented during the eu summit in greece in june 2003 .
the peace march in the industrial ruhr basin focussed on those parts of the european constitution which , according to peace groups , encourage militarization .
they quoted article i-41 , which states : " member states shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities . "
" this is a commitment to rearmament on a constitutional level , " said felix oekentorp , spokesman of the ruhr easter march committee .
" this is unequalled worldwide and that alone is reason enough for us to say that this constitution draft is not acceptable for the peace movement . "
not mimic the united states european citizens should use the referendum process as an opportunity to lead an " intense discussion " about what kind of europe they want , said stenner .
" if the current constitution draft were to fail , peace initiatives and globalization opponents are hopeful that the basic principles of the european union will move more in the direction of social justness , greater commitment to peace politics and dealing with conflicts civilly , " he said .
if the referendums failed , european governments would have to rework the constitution .
" europe should n't strive to militarily mimic the superpower united states , " said stenner .
" rather , it should use its peacemaking policies to bridge the gap to southern countries , as well as to the islamic and arab world . "
the easter peace marches started in britain in the 1950s to call for nuclear disarmament .
since then , tens of thousands of people across europe take to the streets during easter .

activists protested against war , cutbacks in the social welfare system and the new eu constitution . the us-led war in iraq was the center of renewed criticism at germany 's easter peace marches in 65 cities across the country this year .
but participants also emphasized the drawbacks of the new european constitution , which must be approved by german lawmakers on may 12 .
" we want social equality and civil protection rather than pre-emptive war , as well as a democratic europe , " said willi van ooyen , spokesman for the organizers " informationsstelle ostermarsch . "
van ooyen said the diversity of participants reflected the lasting awareness of people interested in the peace movement to get involved in current political debates .
" never again fascism , never again war " the main demonstrations took place in berlin , hamburg and frankfurt , where the organizers are based .
the network of the german peace movement took a positive stock of the marches .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors in fretzdorf form the words " no bombs " " sixty years after the liberation of germany from hitler 's fascism and the end of the second world war , these demonstrations expressed the indissoluble consensus of the era : never again fascism , never again war , " the network 's director manfred stenner said in a statement .
he said the ongoing skepticism against war and the military in germany was also the merit of the postwar peace movement .
constitution committed to rearmament ?
the protests also drew attention to the new european constitution , which is currently in its ratification process across europe .
stenner said , though , that this criticism was not directed against europe 's integration , but rather because the draft " sets the course for rearmament and military adventure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the constitution 's draft was presented during the eu summit in greece in june 2003 .
the peace march in the industrial ruhr basin focussed on those parts of the european constitution which , according to peace groups , encourage militarization .
they quoted article i-41 , which states : " member states shall undertake progressively to improve their military capabilities . "
" this is a commitment to rearmament on a constitutional level , " said felix oekentorp , spokesman of the ruhr easter march committee .
" this is unequalled worldwide and that alone is reason enough for us to say that this constitution draft is not acceptable for the peace movement . "
not mimic the united states european citizens should use the referendum process as an opportunity to lead an " intense discussion " about what kind of europe they want , said stenner .
" if the current constitution draft were to fail , peace initiatives and globalization opponents are hopeful that the basic principles of the european union will move more in the direction of social justness , greater commitment to peace politics and dealing with conflicts civilly , " he said .
if the referendums failed , european governments would have to rework the constitution .
" europe should n't strive to militarily mimic the superpower united states , " said stenner .
" rather , it should use its peacemaking policies to bridge the gap to southern countries , as well as to the islamic and arab world . "
the easter peace marches started in britain in the 1950s to call for nuclear disarmament .
since then , tens of thousands of people across europe take to the streets during easter .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .

all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer that also has to do with the fact that many european countries - and especially the new members - use nato as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it .
for , the united states is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together .
all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .

the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer that also has to do with the fact that many european countries - and especially the new members - use nato as a guarantee of protection but contribute very little to it .
for , the united states is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together .
all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .
in that respect , the idea of intervention troops that can be quickly deployed , which nato is now pursuing , has n't changed much , since that is not where the problems in cooperating lay .
alliance or not , national intelligence agencies do n't work closely enough together .
although the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks caused nato partners to close ranks , petty jealousy and mistrust continue to hamper the exchange of information .
but close cooperation of the part of intelligence agencies is indispensable to prevent terror .

" reads the writing on the wall german chancellor gerhard schröder has come under fire for saying that german corporate heads are failing to create new jobs in spite of business-friendly reforms initiated by his government . on tuesday , senior representatives of german industry denied schröder 's allegations , saying that investments in germany would continue to be made although conditions were far from ideal .
opposition politicians accused the chancellor of trying to deflect attention from the fact that his economic policy was a shambles . the german chancellor has grown increasingly edgy in recent weeks : two months before a crucial regional election , his center-left government is battered by political scandals , strategy blunders and an economic crisis that wo n't go away . losing the election in the industrial state of north rhine-westphalia in may would severely hamper the chancellor 's ability to act by giving the opposition sufficient clout to block his legislative moves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel will keep producing cars in germany for now now the chancellor has identified a scapegoat responsible for his troubles .
german business leaders , he told bild on sunday newspaper , should stop moving jobs abroad and start investing in germany again .
he claimed that corporate conditions were now excellent after his government had slashed taxes and labor unions had made compromises on wages and working hours . party backs schröder on tuesday , spd leader franz müntefering joined the chancellor 's criticism . " we have taken various steps in recent years that have helped companies improve their competitiveness , " he said .
" and many companies have been rather successful in this .
but there are also bad examples of corporations moving thousands of job abroad and we are now calling on them to make greater efforts and start investing in germany again . " german corparate leaders , however , rejected schröder 's allegations and said blame-throwing would n't help in difficult times . business leaders call for more reforms ludwig braun , the president of the german chamber of industry and commerce , argued that investments in german industry were rising again in spite of the fact that conditions were hardly ideal here . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waiting to collect unemployment money the head of the german metal-working employers , martin kannegiesser , said the chancellor must come to understand that globalization requires a strong presence in foreign markets .
reducing germany 's 5.2 million unemployed people , he added , will take a long time and requires much more sweeping political reforms . opposition leaders such as cdu general secretary volker kauder have been more stinging in their criticism of schröder . " this is just a ploy by the chancellor to deflect attention from his government 's huge policy failures , " he said .
" he wants to distract from the visa scandal involving foreign minister joschka fischer and his own inability to create conditions in germany that are conducive to investments here . " matching words with deeds christine scheel , finance policy expert of schröder 's junior coalition partners in the government , the greens , said the chancellor should match his words with deeds now .
it can no longer be tolerated she said that german companies , for example , can even write off against taxes the costs associated with moving jobs abroad . " i do n't think that such behavior is alright , " she said .
" it 's become a really big problem that companies have moved jobs abroad .
the fact that this is even fostered by tax write-offs is something no-one can understand .

at the same time more than 9,000 jobs have been created at their foreign subsidiaries . in view of record unemployment of 12.6 percent of the work force , the chancellor 's political fortunes have slumped drastically making victory in general elections next year ever more unlikely . uwe hessler -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder : time for industry to act chancellor gerhard schröder took a swipe at business leaders over the weekend , telling them the government had done its part to rejuvenate the economy , now it 's time for industry to step up to the plate and create jobs .

a meeting this week between the us candidate to head the world bank , paul wolfowitz , and eu ministers is set to be low key but various sources agree that the european union wants a strengthened voice in the world body . the informal meeting due to be held in brussels by the end of the week between wolfowitz and european governors of the world bank , who in general are finance ministers , is to be off-limits to the press , a source close to the current luxembourg presidency of european union ministerial meetings said .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker will host the meeting , according to reuters news service . one european source said that the meeting might be held on wednesday afternoon before a vote of all administrators of the world bank to be held in washington on thursday . europe resigned to wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder during the february meeting in mainz at an eu summit here a week ago , european leaders signaled that they were resigned to the nomination of wolfowitz by washington to head the world bank , which concentrates on long-term development projects , support and advice for developing countries .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund . " the newspaper said that european finance ministers had discussed at their meeting last weekend " the need for a similar arrangement at the bank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf headquarters in washington traditionally , europe chooses the managing director of the imf and the united states appoints the head of the world bank .
the informal rule has never been broken since the two institutions were set up in the wake of world war ii .
while the us holds 16 percent of shares and votes in the world bank , europe has 30 percent . a european deputy ? germany reportedly took the view that wolfowitz could himself appoint a european to head his team but that britain was skeptical about any deal that excluded developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has appeared receptive to this line of thinking .
he told the washington post on sunday that that he did not see a problem in appointing a european to an important position within the bank . last week belgian finance minister didier reynders also suggested that one of the posts of vice president at the bank be filled by a european . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.03.2005 ukrainian students feel visa scandal pinch großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german embassy is reluctant to even give language students visas the german foreign ministry 's liberal visa policy for east europeans has caused much controversy .
now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .
for students in a country where the average monthly income is around 80 euros , that 's a lot of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yuschchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on march 9 " we do n't know what we 've done wrong , " said nedopjokina .

now , even ukrainian exchange students wanting to come to germany have been adversely affected . they meant to spend two weeks improving their german at dresden 's technical university .
but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .
for students in a country where the average monthly income is around 80 euros , that 's a lot of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yuschchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on march 9 " we do n't know what we 've done wrong , " said nedopjokina .

but for the 29 students and the dean of the european studies faculty from lugansk university in eastern ukraine , the trip ended before it even began .
the german embassy refused to issue visas to the group , which had hoped to be the first to come to dresden and take advantage of the cooperation agreement between the two universities . the group collected all the necessary documents and traveled to kiev , over 800 kilometers -lrb- 500 miles -rrb- away , for individual interviews in the german embassy there .
" we were at the embassy the whole day , from 11:00 to 4:00 .
and a few days later , when president yushchenko was in brussels , we got the rejection , " said the european studies dean , marina nedopjokina . the embassy did not even provide an explanation for its decision , despite a query by nedopjokina . lawyer ulrich drenkelfort , who helped the students apply for the visas , suggested that the embassy 's once too liberal issuance of visas had now reverted to the opposite .
he said people can expect a higher rate of rejection since the commission of inquiry in germany started its work to examine the details of the visa scandal caused by foreign minister joschka fischer .
fischer supposedly ordered german consular services to be more lenient in issuing visas to visitors .
bildunterschrift : the probe into the visa scandal is underway at the same time , it 's hard to follow the embassy 's logic in rejecting nedopjokina 's visa application .
she had visited germany only a few weeks ago to fine-tune details of the project with the university in dresden .
" that 's incomprehensible in legal terms , " said drenkelfort . searching for the logic he said the students had done everything possible to avoid their applications being rejected .
each one presented a personal invitation from the german university and signed a guarantee assuring they would cover all possible costs during their visit .
the dresden college 's chancellor , alfred post , even wrote a letter to the embassy on behalf of the students to ensure that they would be able to come to germany .
but he did n't receive a response either .
now the project - which eventually would have seen ukrainian students completing part of their studies in dresden and receiving a double diploma - may be in threat . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer has been under fire for weeks over the visa scandal " the cooperation naturally requires mutual visits and that the students can also come here , " post explained .
" we ca n't have a cooperation agreement including student exchanges if no visas are issued . " still , the students are n't yet ready to give up .
they are drafting appeals to the embassy 's decision and banking that political pressure will result in them getting permission to go to dresden . no compensation but it 's not just the bureacratic hassle that 's bothering the student group . each of them had to pay a non-refundable 35-euro -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- fee along with their visa application .
for students in a country where the average monthly income is around 80 euros , that 's a lot of money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president viktor yuschchenko -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder in berlin on march 9 " we do n't know what we 've done wrong , " said nedopjokina .
" the students and their parents ask how such a thing is possible , above all , in our world today , after the political changes , after our president yushchenko was in brussels and met with chancellor gerhard schröder and joschka fischer in early march . " it remains doubtful whether those questions will ever be answered .
but , for the time being , the university in dresden plans to work around the problems .
until things settle down concerning issuing visas , the college will send language teachers to instruct students at the ukrainian university . christiane hoffmann -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de chancellor possibly knew about visa row a scandal over lax visa policies that has dogged foreign minister joschka fischer for weeks has taken on a new twist after reports that chancellor gerhard schröder was allegedly fully aware of the issue for years .

foreign minister joschka fischer has long been one of germany 's most popular politicians .
but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .

german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .

for , the united states is militarily still stronger than all the other alliance members put together .
all of washington 's appeals to the europeans to increase their military expenditures have so far been in vain . despite last year 's expansion , nato risks degenerating into a transatlantic talking shop .
in that respect , the idea of intervention troops that can be quickly deployed , which nato is now pursuing , has n't changed much , since that is not where the problems in cooperating lay .
alliance or not , national intelligence agencies do n't work closely enough together .
although the sept .
11 , 2001 , attacks caused nato partners to close ranks , petty jealousy and mistrust continue to hamper the exchange of information .

a year ago nato underwent the largest expansion in the organization 's history , when on march 29 , seven eastern and south-eastern european countries joined the alliance .
nato may have grown in size , but not in importance . the expansion was a big step for nato - largely because , with the three baltic countries , the first successor states of the soviet union , the erstwhile superpower which was the impetus for nato 's establishment to start with .
fear of moscow was the main reason for estonia , latvia and lithuania to enter the alliance 's protective screen . but , keeping things in perspective , russia is n't a threat to its western neighbors .
for years it 's been a guest at nato 's table ; it even has a say in a broad range of matters .
nato expansion was certainly an important symbol that the cold war chapter is really closed - but just one of many . new chapters in world history already started long ago : southeastern europe has clearly put the era of war behind it , but it still suffers from the consequences .
from bosnia and herzegovina to serbia-montenegro and kosovo to macedonia , a number of more or less unstable states stretches through the region , keeping europe 's security architects holding their breath . and even if nato 's intervention in the kosovo war was on the margins of legality according to international law , all things considered , the alliance played a positive role in the region 's stabilization . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but today 's overriding task - the fight against international terrorism - has n't yet reached such a conclusion .
the united states , with the help of its nato partners , did indeed put an end to the taliban 's reign of terror in afghanistan and , at the same time , significantly weakened an important al qaeda base . however , despite the alliance 's presence , the country is far from being either stable or a functioning democracy .
and terrorist leader osama bin laden is still at large ; his network continues to operate , as the terrible attacks in madrid last year showed . there 's also the large-scale anti-terror project " enduring freedom , " which is meant to ensure security in the mediterranean and persian gulf states .
here , too , substantial nato contingents are in action , but there still are n't any measurable results . nato suffered the biggest set-back , however , with the iraq war .
the alliance split over whether the body of evidence against saddam hussein was sufficient to justify military intervention .
and although the fissure between the war coalition partners and the war 's opponents has been passably cemented together , the united states no longer sees nato as a hard and fast alliance but as a list of potential partners .

a meeting this week between the us candidate to head the world bank , paul wolfowitz , and eu ministers is set to be low key but various sources agree that the european union wants a strengthened voice in the world body . the informal meeting due to be held in brussels by the end of the week between wolfowitz and european governors of the world bank , who in general are finance ministers , is to be off-limits to the press , a source close to the current luxembourg presidency of european union ministerial meetings said .
luxembourg 's premier jean-claude juncker will host the meeting , according to reuters news service . one european source said that the meeting might be held on wednesday afternoon before a vote of all administrators of the world bank to be held in washington on thursday . europe resigned to wolfowitz bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and schröder during the february meeting in mainz at an eu summit here a week ago , european leaders signaled that they were resigned to the nomination of wolfowitz by washington to head the world bank , which concentrates on long-term development projects , support and advice for developing countries .
german chancellor gerhard schröder has reportedly told us president george w. bush that his country will not oppose wolfowitz 's nomination . there has been widespread criticism of the nomination because wolfowitz , who is currently us deputy secretary for defense , was one of the main people behind the war in iraq . however , the europeans could make use of the meeting with this so-called " neo-conservative " figure to obtain increased representation within the world bank . imf as model ? the financial times reported on monday that european finance ministers wanted a " counterweight " to wolfowitz and that " france wants a strong new european deputy , mirroring the division of jobs at the international monetary fund . " the newspaper said that european finance ministers had discussed at their meeting last weekend " the need for a similar arrangement at the bank . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : imf headquarters in washington traditionally , europe chooses the managing director of the imf and the united states appoints the head of the world bank .
the informal rule has never been broken since the two institutions were set up in the wake of world war ii .
while the us holds 16 percent of shares and votes in the world bank , europe has 30 percent . a european deputy ? germany reportedly took the view that wolfowitz could himself appoint a european to head his team but that britain was skeptical about any deal that excluded developing countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfowitz has appeared receptive to this line of thinking .
he told the washington post on sunday that that he did not see a problem in appointing a european to an important position within the bank . last week belgian finance minister didier reynders also suggested that one of the posts of vice president at the bank be filled by a european . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de us , europe avoid rift on development aid although a us-europe rift threatened to torpedo a british-led initiative to tackle global poverty as finance chiefs from the group of seven met in london , a pledge to provide debt relief was secured at the last minute .

dyfed-powys chief constable terence grange is concerned that malicious allegations against teachers mean many school activities are being stopped .
the bbc wales programme taro naw , shown on tuesday , will reveal the concerns of teachers and their unions .
one union said pupils would miss school trips as teachers feared accusations .
mr grange , who speaks on child protection for the association of chief police officers , said : " i think people get far too worried about what are essentially trivial things .
i felt like dirty laundry , everybody was talking about me wrongly-accused teacher beryl lewis " education departments should look very seriously at their processes and , where necessary , speed them up where allegations are made .
" and an awful lot of parents should sometimes question what their children are telling them . "
geraint davies , of teaching union nasuwt cymru , said trivial allegations were on the increase and also called for common sense .
" so many allegations are petty - touching a pupil 's arm or splitting up a fight between pupils , " he said .
" it 's upsetting that children and parents use these examples to make malicious allegations against teachers , and these allegations leave their mark . "
teacher beryl lewis also told taro naw that minor allegations made against her caused her to suffer depression and led her to suicidal thoughts .
terence grange says stopping school trips would be a ' tragedy ' ms lewis , from north pembrokeshire , was suspended for eight months before being cleared of accusations of shouting in a classroom and grabbing a child 's coat .
" i was named in the paper and that almost finished me off , " she said .
" i felt like dirty laundry , everybody was talking about me .
sometimes i felt like driving off a cliff , i just could n't face it any more .
" my friends told me not to be so silly but that 's how it makes you feel , and i 'm sure other teachers who have been through the same experience can understand my feelings . "
mr davies warned that children were " losing out " because teachers were fearful of organising school trips and extra-curricular activities .
others also felt reluctant to comfort small children who fell over in the school playground , he said .
mr grange added : " i think common sense went out of the window a long time ago .
" i think properly organised trips are delightful things for kids to go on .
it 's a tragedy they do n't occur . "

dyfed-powys chief constable terence grange is concerned that malicious allegations against teachers mean many school activities are being stopped .
the bbc wales programme taro naw , shown on tuesday , will reveal the concerns of teachers and their unions .
one union said pupils would miss school trips as teachers feared accusations .
mr grange , who speaks on child protection for the association of chief police officers , said : " i think people get far too worried about what are essentially trivial things .
i felt like dirty laundry , everybody was talking about me wrongly-accused teacher beryl lewis " education departments should look very seriously at their processes and , where necessary , speed them up where allegations are made .
" and an awful lot of parents should sometimes question what their children are telling them . "
geraint davies , of teaching union nasuwt cymru , said trivial allegations were on the increase and also called for common sense .
" so many allegations are petty - touching a pupil 's arm or splitting up a fight between pupils , " he said .
" it 's upsetting that children and parents use these examples to make malicious allegations against teachers , and these allegations leave their mark . "
teacher beryl lewis also told taro naw that minor allegations made against her caused her to suffer depression and led her to suicidal thoughts .
terence grange says stopping school trips would be a ' tragedy ' ms lewis , from north pembrokeshire , was suspended for eight months before being cleared of accusations of shouting in a classroom and grabbing a child 's coat .
" i was named in the paper and that almost finished me off , " she said .
" i felt like dirty laundry , everybody was talking about me .
sometimes i felt like driving off a cliff , i just could n't face it any more .
" my friends told me not to be so silly but that 's how it makes you feel , and i 'm sure other teachers who have been through the same experience can understand my feelings . "
mr davies warned that children were " losing out " because teachers were fearful of organising school trips and extra-curricular activities .
others also felt reluctant to comfort small children who fell over in the school playground , he said .
mr grange added : " i think common sense went out of the window a long time ago .
" i think properly organised trips are delightful things for kids to go on .
it 's a tragedy they do n't occur . "
taro naw is on s4c on tuesday , 29 march , at 2025 bst .

supporters say it has brought health benefits , but critics say more people are drinking and smoking at home .
pubs and restaurants are covered by the ban .
many publicans say they have lost trade .
earlier this month , irish prime minister bertie ahern said more than 7,000 smokers had kicked the habit since the smoking ban was introduced .
mr ahern said it was clear the ban on workplace smoking was having a positive effect .
since the end of march 2004 , smoking has been illegal in workplaces , including pubs and restaurants in the republic of ireland .
it was the first country in the world to introduce such a nationwide ban .
' smoking illegally ' mr ahern said it had proved a positive effect not only on the health of the nation , " but also on the functioning of our health services " .
the government-backed smoking " quitline " has received more than 30,000 calls since it was set up 18 months ago , said the taoiseach .
last year , a major drinks company blamed the smoking ban for a fall in the sales of guinness .
shares in diageo , the world 's biggest drinks company , fell by 4 % .
owners of pubs where people are caught smoking illegally by health inspectors enforcing the ban can be fined up to 3,000 euros -lrb- £ 2,400 -rrb- .
maura gillespie of the british heart foundation urged downing street to introduce similar measures .
" the move has grown in popularity since its introduction , and seems to have proved easier to enforce than first anticipated , " she said .
a smoking ban in all northern ireland government departments came into effect in january .
many in northern ireland , particularly doctors and politicians , have called for a universal ban .

in london , early tuesday trade saw the cost of a barrel of brent crude - the benchmark price - slide more than $ 1.30 to $ 52.60 after a four-day weekend .
us prices closed at $ 53.68 on monday , below the 17 march peak of $ 56.15 .
expectations of higher us interest rates have led speculators to switch their attention away from the oil market to focus on the rising dollar .
reassurance on monday from uk oil giant bp that an explosion at its texas refinery a week earlier would not affect its us petrol -lrb- gasoline -rrb- supplies also eased upward price pressures .
the dollar reached a level of 107.38 yen in tokyo on tuesday morning , a five-month high , while monday had seen the us currency reach its strongest level for six weeks against the euro .
pressure however , the oil price still remains almost 25 % up on the beginning of the year , and demand remains strong .
in mid-march , opec agreed to increase oil production by 500,000 barrels a day .
there had been talk , particularly by saudi arabia , of raising production levels again .
china , where the breakneck economy has a growing thirst for energy , is forecasting a 10 % rise in petroleum demand in 2005 with economic growth remaining close to 9 % .
some analysts have suggested china could impose a 20-50 % tax on petrol in order to damp down retail demand - although industry is driving most of its energy usage .
in the us , meanwhile , the average price of gasoline has reached a new record of $ 2.15 a gallon , with the cost at the pump soaring way beyond that level in many high-demand areas .
adjusted for inflation , however , us fuel costs remain well below the historic high of $ 3.08 a gallon reached in 1981 .

campaigners had urged the lake district national park authority to halt the 10mph limit on windermere , saying it would impact on tourism .
but the authority says it will make the lake a more tranquil place to visit .
opponents say they have nowhere else to water-ski or use power boats , and that there was no real conflict between users and other holidaymakers .
the authority , which intends to enforce the limit by collecting evidence using digital video equipment , still cameras and a laser gun , believes it marks a new future for windermere .
it says rangers will be on duty from tuesday , but will not " chase " lawbreakers and risk lives .
those found flouting the law could be fined hundreds of pounds .

campaigners had urged the lake district national park authority to halt the 10mph limit on windermere , saying it would impact on tourism .
but the authority says it will make the lake a more tranquil place to visit .
opponents say they have nowhere else to water-ski or use power boats , and that there was no real conflict between users and other holidaymakers .
the authority , which intends to enforce the limit by collecting evidence using digital video equipment , still cameras and a laser gun , believes it marks a new future for windermere .
it says rangers will be on duty from tuesday , but will not " chase " lawbreakers and risk lives .
those found flouting the law could be fined hundreds of pounds .
campaigners , such as the keep windermere alive association , say they are bemused by the limit and that all is needed is a managed solution which would involve powered craft users being looked after by a governing body .
the bylaw was confirmed in 2000 following a public inquiry , but it was suspended for five years to give businesses time to adapt , according to the authority .

the headmaster and the headscarves tuesday , 29 march , 2005 2100 bst on bbc two this world follows a group of veiled girls at eugene delacroix school in paris , who decide to resist the new law in defiance of its headmaster , raymond scieux .
monsieur scieux firmly believes that " religion must remain a personal matter , " but the 10 veiled girls at delacroix insist that this issue is more complex .
one of these veiled students , khadidja , is asked : " if you had to choose between education and religion , which would you choose ? "
she answers : " that 's a very good question and i really do n't know .
i ca n't distinguish between the two because for me , education is part of religion . "
the majority of teaching staff at the school are in favour of the ban because they feel that french schools have a duty to help girls withstand religious pressure from their families .
but the girls insist this is not the case , that wearing the veil is a personal choice , and that they do not need protecting .
in fact , khadidja says her parents would ask her to de-veil before sacrificing her education .
khadidja is one of five veiled girls from delacroix who meet once a week - with a handful of anti-law teachers and non-muslim schoolfriends - to discuss how they can fight a strict interpretation of the law at their school .
their fear is that the headmaster will decide to ban all headcoverings , so they search for a compromise .
but events take a dramatic turn after iraqi terrorists kidnap two french journalists and demand the repeal of the ban .
and in a meeting at the school to discuss the new rules , the veiled students soon feel victimised and misunderstood .
filmed over a year , with unique access to events at the school , this documentary captures the anguish of veiled schoolgirls , teachers , and school authorities as they grapple with rules which threaten to inflame the tensions they were designed to calm .

the headmaster and the headscarves tuesday , 29 march , 2005 2100 bst on bbc two this world follows a group of veiled girls at eugene delacroix school in paris , who decide to resist the new law in defiance of its headmaster , raymond scieux .
monsieur scieux firmly believes that " religion must remain a personal matter , " but the 10 veiled girls at delacroix insist that this issue is more complex .
one of these veiled students , khadidja , is asked : " if you had to choose between education and religion , which would you choose ? "
she answers : " that 's a very good question and i really do n't know .
i ca n't distinguish between the two because for me , education is part of religion . "
the majority of teaching staff at the school are in favour of the ban because they feel that french schools have a duty to help girls withstand religious pressure from their families .
but the girls insist this is not the case , that wearing the veil is a personal choice , and that they do not need protecting .
in fact , khadidja says her parents would ask her to de-veil before sacrificing her education .
khadidja is one of five veiled girls from delacroix who meet once a week - with a handful of anti-law teachers and non-muslim schoolfriends - to discuss how they can fight a strict interpretation of the law at their school .
their fear is that the headmaster will decide to ban all headcoverings , so they search for a compromise .

increasingly computer criminals are using swarms of remotely controlled computers to carry out denial of service attacks on websites , launch worms and relay spam around the net .
" we have seen attacks involving five and ten gigabytes of traffic , " said rob pollard , sales director for arbor networks which is behind the fingerprinting system .

" what we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source , " said mr pollard .
arbor network 's technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network .
it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups .
any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind .
this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines .
anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack .
" attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated , " said malcolm seagrave , security expert at energis .
" in the last 12 months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we 've seen massive growth . "
he said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks , often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks .

arbor network 's technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network .
it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups .
any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind .
this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines .
anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack .

" attacks of that size cause collateral damage as they cross the internet before they get to their destination , " he said .
once an attack is spotted and its signature defined the information will be passed back down the chain of networks affected to help every unwitting player tackle the problem .

" what we want to do is help net service firms communicate with each other and then push the attacks further and further back around the world to their source , " said mr pollard .
arbor network 's technology works by building up a detailed history of traffic on a network .
it spots which computers or groups of users regularly talk to each other and what types of traffic passes between machines or workgroups .
any anomaly to this usual pattern is spotted and flagged to network administrators who can take action if the traffic is due to a net-based attack of some kind .
this type of close analysis has become very useful as net attacks are increasingly launched using several hundred or thousand different machines .
anyone looking at the traffic on a machine by machine basis would be unlikely to spot that they were all part of a concerted attack .
" attacks are getting more diffuse and more sophisticated , " said malcolm seagrave , security expert at energis .
" in the last 12 months it started getting noticeable that criminals were taking to it and we 've seen massive growth . "
he said that although informal systems exist to pass on information about attacks , often commercial confidentiality got in the way of sharing enough information to properly combat attacks .

the jobless rate rose to 4.7 % in february , from 4.5 % the previous month , where no change had been forecast .
data also published on tuesday showed a fall in household spending and a sharp decline in retail sales in february .
japan emerged from a mild recession at the end of 2004 but the government insists its recovery is on track .
shares fall " we do not have big concerns , " hiroyuki hosoda , japan 's chief cabinet secretary , said of the latest economic data .
however , stock markets reacted negatively to the figures , japan 's benchmark index falling to its lowest level in four months .
the nikkei average fell 1.6 % to 11,599.82 .
employment rates had improved in 2004 as an export-led economic recovery encouraged manufacturers to take on more staff .
the economic slowdown seems to be over but solid evidence is still lacking toshio sumitani , tokyo research centre analysts said the february decline was a surprise but said it may reflect the fact that people were looking for better paid jobs .
household spending fell 3.8 % year-on-year in february while retail sales dropped 2.8 % , their sharpest annual decline since november 2003 .
shop sales were affected by the 2004 leap year which meant there were fewer sundays last month than in february 2004 .
' unexpectedly weak ' the japanese economy went into reverse in the middle of last year , its gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- contracting in two successive quarters .
it managed a modest recovery in the final quarter , showing 0.1 % growth .
" the february data have been unexpectedly weak , " toshio sumitani , an economist with the tokyo research centre , told agence france presse .
" the economic slowdown seems to be over , which has been reflected in a stock market that has been advancing since early this year but solid evidence -lrb- for this -rrb- is still lacking . "

john travolta 's screen career bears marked similarities with his luxury boeing 707 , which he personally flew to britain earlier this month .
either he is soaring high with box-office hits like face / off and look who 's talking , or he is plummeting in costly disasters like battlefield earth .
this year finds him very much in the ascendant , though , after the us box office success of his new comedy be cool .
cool is something travolta knows a lot about , having earned his stripes as the disco-dancing tony manero in saturday night fever and danny zuko , the swaggering ' t-bird ' from grease .
during his recent visit to london , however , he took time to pay homage to an icon from an earlier era - namely , former 007 sean connery .
adopting a passable scottish accent , travolta recalls a phone call he received from the veteran actor praising his portrayal of unflappable loan shark chili palmer in 1995 's get shorty .
" i said , ' sean , i think you like it because it reminds you of you ! '
" chili is all the things james bond is - fearless , dapper , elegant and romantic .
that was the connection i made in my mind , so i thought : ' why not give the american answer to it ? " '
music business based on a novel by elmore leonard , the latest film , be cool , finds palmer swapping the movie business for the music game .
but trouble follows him wherever he goes , and soon he finds himself facing russian gangsters , gun-toting rappers and scheming record producers .
" chili always takes advantage of an opportunity , " says travolta .
" he never really worries about anything .
" even if he 's not particularly confident you 'd never know it .
he 's always analysing how to get in and out of situations in a very cool way . "
so how does travolta define cool himself ?
the 50-year-old gives a thoughtful and considered response .
" cool initially meant to be fearless , and was associated with early music and film icons - marlon brando , james dean and people like that .
" then it evolved into meaning ' hip ' , and from there it evolved into being comfortable with yourself .
i 'm probably more of the last definition . "
fancy footwork no father can be cool to his children , though .
" my daughter tells me to stop if i ever sing or dance , " he says ruefully .
dancing forms a key part of be cool , which sees travolta taking to the dancefloor once more with his pulp fiction co-star uma thurman .
the duo enjoyed a memorable twist ten years ago in quentin tarantino 's film and jumped at the chance to pair up again .
" we were going to do it anyway because i wanted chili to dance , but uma being there was a bonus , " says travolta .
" we mixed up some of the traditional dances from the 50s and 60s - the cha-cha , samba and foxtrot . "
no amount of fancy footwork could impress some us critics , with the new york times attacking the sequel 's " unmotivated cast " and " conceptually anaemic plot " .
but this will hardly trouble travolta , who is considering spending some of his $ 20 million -lrb- £ 10.5m -rrb- salary on the illuminated dance floor he cavorted on in saturday night fever , currently up for auction .
" if i were smart i 'd buy it - i gave everything else away , " he says .
" but it would depend on how much they would take me for . "
be cool is on release in london now .
it goes nationwide on friday .
