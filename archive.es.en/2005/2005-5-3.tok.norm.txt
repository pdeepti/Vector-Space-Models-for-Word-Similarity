to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth .

but thousands struck up relations with german women , and many of them fathered children they never knew . the official reason for the fraternization ban introduced in september 1944 was to punish german civilians , while maintaining the authority of the occupying forces and protecting them from the insidious force of nazi propaganda . in fact , it served another , more delicate purpose .
after landing in italy in 1943 , the allied armies had been badly weakened by the rapid spread of venereal disease brought about by the soldiers ' contact with prostitutes . american gis were warned against encounters with local women .
but it was to no avail - in the chaos of the postwar years , gis and german girls both needed each other . corned beef and cigarettes in 1945 , christa ronke was 16 years old and working at an officers ' mess hall in southwestern berlin .
" the gis had an eye for the girls ! " she said .
" at first they saw us all as nazis , but they soon relaxed .
and they seemed so well-off , so good-looking and casual - and they stood for the whole american way of life .
they were hard to resist ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " der blaue engel " after six years of a war which had left their own men either dead or physically and psychologically traumatized , the us servicemen were an irresistible draw for germany 's lonely , starving women . the men could get them corned beef and cigarettes - and show them a good time .
" they had chocolate and silk stockings , " said ronke .
" there were no german men left , but then suddenly there were all these young americans to go out dancing with .
they were n't like the russians , who were so scrawny and poor - compared , to them , even we germans had a lot .
it was the girls with american boyfriends who were envied . " whores and traitors " but the men coming back from the war hated it , " explained ronke .
to them , the german women were fraternizing with the enemy - exchanging sex for material gain .
punishments could be harsh - some women were publicly denounced as whores and traitors , others had their heads shaved , while some were even set on fire .
but it was a fact of life in the immediate aftermath of the war . " american soldiers together with german women was a common sight , " said ronke .
" they were crazy times . " bildunterschrift : an american gi flirts with german girls three out of four gis had sexual encounters overseas , and by late 1945 , one in five german babies was born out of wedlock .
by 1955 , up to 67,700 illegitimate children had been fathered by us soldiers - some 5,000 of whom were afro-american . the " occupation children " were a thorn in the side of adenauer 's germany - especially the high percentage of mixed-race children , many of whom were sent to the us for adoption in the ensuing years .
not least , they were a huge financial burden on the country .
us soldiers were exempt from having to pay child support unless they acknowledged paternity , and taxpayers had to bear the costs of the nation 's illegitimate children of gi fathers . life was hard for both the children and their abandoned mothers .
their lovers had made promises - marriage , a new life in the states - that were cruelly broken .
many belatedly found out their boyfriends had wives back home .
ostracized by society , these women and their children became the pariahs of postwar germany . bildunterschrift : orphaned children in post-war germany play during a break a happy end for some not all of the women who fell in love with gis suffered an unhappy end .
after the us congress lifted the fraternization ban and passed the war brides act in december 1945 , gis were free to marry their german sweethearts .
and they did so in droves .
in 1949 , some 13,000 marriages between german women and us servicemen took place .
between 1946 and 1949 , approximately 20,000 german women immigrated to the states .
the first batch of european war brides set sail for america aboard the " argentina , " a steamship specially fitted out with nurseries .
it marked the start of the largest single influx of mothers and infants into the us in two centuries . but domestic bliss it was n't .
maria m. was 16 when she met her gi husband in munich .
after a long courtship , she immigrated to the us in 1948 , but she never felt at home in ohio .
her husband had no family , and she was left to fend for herself while he went to work everyday .
the locals were far from welcoming .
“ they considered me the devil , i was known as the ' nazi girl ' , " she said .
" i was isolated , nobody talked to me .
it was like solitary confinement . "
gina r. , felt equally lonely in the states .
when she left germany in 1950 , she couldn ’ t believe how little her new american family in tulsa , oklahoma , talked to one another .
" they just sat in front of the television all the time ! " she said .
" i was never happy in the states because i felt so homesick , so after two years my husband and i moved back here .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

after the meeting , schröder said turkey had " clear prospects " for eventual entry into the eu . turkey 's accession to the european union is a central topic for schröder 's brief trip to turkey .
the german leader arrived in ankara on tuesday evening and had an inofficial , private meeting with erdogan . on wednesday , after early-morning official talks with the prime minister , schröder said at a press conference that turkey was on the road to eu membership , but that the country needed to maintain the dynamic of the reforms brussels says are necessary if the negotiations are to begin " promptly on october 3 . " turkey is scheduled to begin the accession talks in early october , but the membership process is widely expected to take at least a decade . schröder added that such important strategic decisions , such as entry into the eu , should not depend on ever-changing opinion polls .
while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid .

in the past weeks , prime minister erdogan has been accused of letting his country 's reform efforts lose momentum . however , on the eve of this visit , schröder praised the " impressive reform policies " of the turkish government .
he noted that erdogan himself has implied that a " change in mentality " is necessary before the policies can be put into effect . " such a change in mentality wo n't take place overnight .
but it is necessary in order for reforms and changes in the law to become everyday , widely accepted practices , " schröder told the newspaper . ' difficult ' negotiations ahead the progress of the reform process will make a decisive difference in determining how the developments of the eu talks , schröder told the paper .
" the negotiations themselves will certainly be long and also difficult . " the chancellor noted that turkey needs to enlarge its eu tariff agreements with the new member states by october 3 - which will mean a de facto recognition of cyprus by ankara . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish newspapers celebrated the accession accord talks " a speedy solution to the cyprus problem would of course make the accession talks much easier , » schröder said .
schröder agreed with turkey 's suggestion of forming a history commission to handle discussions of the massacre of armenians 90 years ago , in what was then known as the ottoman empire . business and church schröder will also meet president ahmet necdet sezer before heading to istanbul on wednesday , where he is scheduled to meet the spiritual leader of the orthodox church , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. he will also attend a german-turkish economic forum in istanbul . with 2.5 million people of turkish origin living within its borders , germany is turkey 's main economic partner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

even before his papal incarnation , he was busy warning readers to steer clear of the imaginative world they so love on the grounds that it contains too much black magic . and now to add insult to injury , his own books have gone and knocked the latest harry potter book from top place in a german book chart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal tcarciso bertone while the book , harry potter and the half-blood prince , is not due for publication until july , fans are so fanatical that they reserved copies well in advance . but the german branch of the online book retailer amazon said the pope 's theological preachings have commandeered the first three places in its list of top 10 bestselling books . at number one is salt of the earth : christianity and the catholic church at the end of the millennium , a book of ratzinger 's interview with german journalist peter seewald , followed in second place by values in time of upheaval , and the self-explanatory introduction to christianity . master potter has thus been relegated to fourth place , but with a further four ratzinger titles in the top 10 , just how long he can hang on in there remains to be seen . knuckle-wrapping for conspiracy thriller j.k. rowling is not the only author to incur the wrath of the catholic church whilst simultaneously being affected by its sudden surge in popularity .
us author dan brown 's conspiracy thriller , the da vinci code , which was recently named book of the year at the british book awards , has also come under fire from the vatican . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bestseller " values in a time of upheaval " cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa , was appointed by the vatican to deny what it says are lies , distortions and mistakes in brown 's bestseller .
the book is based on the idea that the church long concealed the fact that jesus married former prostitute , mary magdalene and that she bore him a child . bertone said the book is filled with absurd and vulgar falsifications which are a clear attempt to discredit the church .
whatever the case , the book has been a massive success , selling more than 25 million copies in 45 languages worldwide . but whether it can weather the storm being created by the pope 's more purist works remains to be seen .
the climb in their popularity on the us amazon site is slower than that on its german subsidiary , but seven of the pontiff 's titles are already in the top 25 . # b # all this theological excitement is big business for a number of german publishers who are working round the clock to keep up with the unexpected demand .
books by and about the former cardinal had sold out in germany within just hours of his election and new print runs - complete with photos of pope benedict xvi in his papal robes - are in the tens of thousands , massively exceeding the original runs . it 's nothing short of a publisher 's paradise , and for the time being at least , there is no sign of waning interest . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's birthplace ecstatic as visitors flock residents of joseph ratzinger 's tiny birthplace of marktl in bavaria who have greeted his election as pope with unrestrained joy and partying now find themselves at the center of world attention .
-lrb- april 20 , 2005 -rrb- church breaks silence on " da vinci code " rarely before have people read so much about jesus .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .

" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .

he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2005 the allies ’ human legacy lives on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1955 up to 67,700 children had been fathered by us soldiers in the decades following world war ii , an entire generation of occupation children grew up not knowing their fathers .
to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth . " i just want to know what my roots are , " he said . jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war 's forgotten children break the silence the traces of world war ii have faded but not disappeared for germans .

not if it 's a big wet one planted by an icon of communist repression . erich honecker , communist east germany 's last leader , has been accused of a lot of evil things over the years : sustaining a totalitarian regime , stifling political dissent , giving shoot-to-kill orders to soldiers guarding the berlin wall , just to name a few .

even before his papal incarnation , he was busy warning readers to steer clear of the imaginative world they so love on the grounds that it contains too much black magic . and now to add insult to injury , his own books have gone and knocked the latest harry potter book from top place in a german book chart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal tcarciso bertone while the book , harry potter and the half-blood prince , is not due for publication until july , fans are so fanatical that they reserved copies well in advance . but the german branch of the online book retailer amazon said the pope 's theological preachings have commandeered the first three places in its list of top 10 bestselling books . at number one is salt of the earth : christianity and the catholic church at the end of the millennium , a book of ratzinger 's interview with german journalist peter seewald , followed in second place by values in time of upheaval , and the self-explanatory introduction to christianity . master potter has thus been relegated to fourth place , but with a further four ratzinger titles in the top 10 , just how long he can hang on in there remains to be seen . knuckle-wrapping for conspiracy thriller j.k. rowling is not the only author to incur the wrath of the catholic church whilst simultaneously being affected by its sudden surge in popularity .
us author dan brown 's conspiracy thriller , the da vinci code , which was recently named book of the year at the british book awards , has also come under fire from the vatican . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bestseller " values in a time of upheaval " cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa , was appointed by the vatican to deny what it says are lies , distortions and mistakes in brown 's bestseller .
the book is based on the idea that the church long concealed the fact that jesus married former prostitute , mary magdalene and that she bore him a child . bertone said the book is filled with absurd and vulgar falsifications which are a clear attempt to discredit the church .
whatever the case , the book has been a massive success , selling more than 25 million copies in 45 languages worldwide . but whether it can weather the storm being created by the pope 's more purist works remains to be seen .
the climb in their popularity on the us amazon site is slower than that on its german subsidiary , but seven of the pontiff 's titles are already in the top 25 . # b # all this theological excitement is big business for a number of german publishers who are working round the clock to keep up with the unexpected demand .
books by and about the former cardinal had sold out in germany within just hours of his election and new print runs - complete with photos of pope benedict xvi in his papal robes - are in the tens of thousands , massively exceeding the original runs . it 's nothing short of a publisher 's paradise , and for the time being at least , there is no sign of waning interest . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's birthplace ecstatic as visitors flock residents of joseph ratzinger 's tiny birthplace of marktl in bavaria who have greeted his election as pope with unrestrained joy and partying now find themselves at the center of world attention .
-lrb- april 20 , 2005 -rrb- church breaks silence on " da vinci code " rarely before have people read so much about jesus .
the religious thriller “ the da vinci code ” has emerged as one of the most successful books of all time .
now , the catholic church is reluctantly taking a look at it .
-lrb- march 23 , 2005 -rrb- kudos for germany 's j.k. rowling she 's been called the german answer to j.k. rowling , author of the harry potter books , but cornelia funke keeps a low profile and is n't even that well known in her native country .
that could soon change .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

" fans from all over europe want fairer access to these tickets , especially as it may be many years before the world cup will be back in europe , " she added in a statement . the british consumer group made a formal complaint to the european commission in march in which it accused fifa , the german football league and mastercard of " anti-competitive " ticketing arrangements that breach european law . consumer group complained of discrimination which ? claimed that the ticket system for 2006 world cup discriminated against fans outside germany and contravened the eu 's own competition rules , adding that the deal struck between the three entities was anti-competitive and put soccer fans in britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as imposing additional and unnecessary costs on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the original rules , tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament could be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 -lrb- 44 euros , $ 59 -rrb- - or via a german bank account .
fans who did not use these methods of payment would not have their applications for tickets processed . new bank accounts for non-euro zone countries under the new arrangements , fifa and the german football association will open bank accounts in the 16 non-euro zone countries which are members of the european economic area -lrb- eaa -rrb- , and accept payments in the local currency .
this will include cyprus , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , hungary , iceland , latvia , liechtenstein , lithuania , malta , norway , poland , slovakia , slovenia , sweden and the united kingdom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa change of payment system applies to the second sales period of tickets for the 2006 world cup in germany , which began monday with a closing date of november 15 . the ticketing system has been under fire ever since it was revealed .
as well as complaints surrounding distribution , the system has been criticized for its complexity and has also been the subject of alleged fraud and the target for internet black marketeers . in total 2.93 million world cup tickets are on sale to the general public and a first batch of 812,000 tickets were sold in the first sales period . ticket prices range from 35 euros to 600 euros for soccer 's biggest showpiece running from june 9 until july 9 , 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second phase of world cup ticket sales opens just days after the first world cup tickets were allocated to their lucky recipients , fifa and the german organizing committee kicked off the second phase comprising special team specific tickets .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .

tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .

he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .

after the meeting , schröder said turkey had " clear prospects " for eventual entry into the eu . turkey 's accession to the european union is a central topic for schröder 's brief trip to turkey .
the german leader arrived in ankara on tuesday evening and had an inofficial , private meeting with erdogan . on wednesday , after early-morning official talks with the prime minister , schröder said at a press conference that turkey was on the road to eu membership , but that the country needed to maintain the dynamic of the reforms brussels says are necessary if the negotiations are to begin " promptly on october 3 . " turkey is scheduled to begin the accession talks in early october , but the membership process is widely expected to take at least a decade . schröder added that such important strategic decisions , such as entry into the eu , should not depend on ever-changing opinion polls .
while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid . " the reforms must be further implemented , and we should be assured of their irreversibility , " schröder told the turkish daily milliyet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's flag and those of other eu candidates flew in brussels he was referring especially to reforms affecting fundamental freedoms , as well as minority and human rights .
in the past weeks , prime minister erdogan has been accused of letting his country 's reform efforts lose momentum . however , on the eve of this visit , schröder praised the " impressive reform policies " of the turkish government .
he noted that erdogan himself has implied that a " change in mentality " is necessary before the policies can be put into effect . " such a change in mentality wo n't take place overnight .
but it is necessary in order for reforms and changes in the law to become everyday , widely accepted practices , " schröder told the newspaper . ' difficult ' negotiations ahead the progress of the reform process will make a decisive difference in determining how the developments of the eu talks , schröder told the paper .
" the negotiations themselves will certainly be long and also difficult . " the chancellor noted that turkey needs to enlarge its eu tariff agreements with the new member states by october 3 - which will mean a de facto recognition of cyprus by ankara . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish newspapers celebrated the accession accord talks " a speedy solution to the cyprus problem would of course make the accession talks much easier , » schröder said .
schröder agreed with turkey 's suggestion of forming a history commission to handle discussions of the massacre of armenians 90 years ago , in what was then known as the ottoman empire . business and church schröder will also meet president ahmet necdet sezer before heading to istanbul on wednesday , where he is scheduled to meet the spiritual leader of the orthodox church , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. he will also attend a german-turkish economic forum in istanbul . with 2.5 million people of turkish origin living within its borders , germany is turkey 's main economic partner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.05.2005 pope versus potter in reading ring großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no. 1 bestseller just a couple of weeks after his elevation to the lofty heights of head of the catholic church , pope benedict xvi is giving harry potter a run for his money in the literary popularity stakes . it would seem as if the former cardinal joseph ratzinger has it in for scottish writer j.k. rowling and her young world of sorcery and witchcraft .
even before his papal incarnation , he was busy warning readers to steer clear of the imaginative world they so love on the grounds that it contains too much black magic . and now to add insult to injury , his own books have gone and knocked the latest harry potter book from top place in a german book chart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal tcarciso bertone while the book , harry potter and the half-blood prince , is not due for publication until july , fans are so fanatical that they reserved copies well in advance . but the german branch of the online book retailer amazon said the pope 's theological preachings have commandeered the first three places in its list of top 10 bestselling books . at number one is salt of the earth : christianity and the catholic church at the end of the millennium , a book of ratzinger 's interview with german journalist peter seewald , followed in second place by values in time of upheaval , and the self-explanatory introduction to christianity . master potter has thus been relegated to fourth place , but with a further four ratzinger titles in the top 10 , just how long he can hang on in there remains to be seen . knuckle-wrapping for conspiracy thriller j.k. rowling is not the only author to incur the wrath of the catholic church whilst simultaneously being affected by its sudden surge in popularity .
us author dan brown 's conspiracy thriller , the da vinci code , which was recently named book of the year at the british book awards , has also come under fire from the vatican . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bestseller " values in a time of upheaval " cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa , was appointed by the vatican to deny what it says are lies , distortions and mistakes in brown 's bestseller .
the book is based on the idea that the church long concealed the fact that jesus married former prostitute , mary magdalene and that she bore him a child . bertone said the book is filled with absurd and vulgar falsifications which are a clear attempt to discredit the church .
whatever the case , the book has been a massive success , selling more than 25 million copies in 45 languages worldwide . but whether it can weather the storm being created by the pope 's more purist works remains to be seen .

but thousands struck up relations with german women , and many of them fathered children they never knew . the official reason for the fraternization ban introduced in september 1944 was to punish german civilians , while maintaining the authority of the occupying forces and protecting them from the insidious force of nazi propaganda . in fact , it served another , more delicate purpose .
after landing in italy in 1943 , the allied armies had been badly weakened by the rapid spread of venereal disease brought about by the soldiers ' contact with prostitutes . american gis were warned against encounters with local women .
but it was to no avail - in the chaos of the postwar years , gis and german girls both needed each other . corned beef and cigarettes in 1945 , christa ronke was 16 years old and working at an officers ' mess hall in southwestern berlin .
" the gis had an eye for the girls ! " she said .
" at first they saw us all as nazis , but they soon relaxed .
and they seemed so well-off , so good-looking and casual - and they stood for the whole american way of life .
they were hard to resist ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " der blaue engel " after six years of a war which had left their own men either dead or physically and psychologically traumatized , the us servicemen were an irresistible draw for germany 's lonely , starving women . the men could get them corned beef and cigarettes - and show them a good time .
" they had chocolate and silk stockings , " said ronke .
" there were no german men left , but then suddenly there were all these young americans to go out dancing with .
they were n't like the russians , who were so scrawny and poor - compared , to them , even we germans had a lot .
it was the girls with american boyfriends who were envied . " whores and traitors " but the men coming back from the war hated it , " explained ronke .
to them , the german women were fraternizing with the enemy - exchanging sex for material gain .
punishments could be harsh - some women were publicly denounced as whores and traitors , others had their heads shaved , while some were even set on fire .
but it was a fact of life in the immediate aftermath of the war . " american soldiers together with german women was a common sight , " said ronke .
" they were crazy times . " bildunterschrift : an american gi flirts with german girls three out of four gis had sexual encounters overseas , and by late 1945 , one in five german babies was born out of wedlock .
by 1955 , up to 67,700 illegitimate children had been fathered by us soldiers - some 5,000 of whom were afro-american . the " occupation children " were a thorn in the side of adenauer 's germany - especially the high percentage of mixed-race children , many of whom were sent to the us for adoption in the ensuing years .
not least , they were a huge financial burden on the country .
us soldiers were exempt from having to pay child support unless they acknowledged paternity , and taxpayers had to bear the costs of the nation 's illegitimate children of gi fathers . life was hard for both the children and their abandoned mothers .
their lovers had made promises - marriage , a new life in the states - that were cruelly broken .
many belatedly found out their boyfriends had wives back home .
ostracized by society , these women and their children became the pariahs of postwar germany . bildunterschrift : orphaned children in post-war germany play during a break a happy end for some not all of the women who fell in love with gis suffered an unhappy end .
after the us congress lifted the fraternization ban and passed the war brides act in december 1945 , gis were free to marry their german sweethearts .
and they did so in droves .
in 1949 , some 13,000 marriages between german women and us servicemen took place .
between 1946 and 1949 , approximately 20,000 german women immigrated to the states .
the first batch of european war brides set sail for america aboard the " argentina , " a steamship specially fitted out with nurseries .
it marked the start of the largest single influx of mothers and infants into the us in two centuries . but domestic bliss it was n't .
maria m. was 16 when she met her gi husband in munich .
after a long courtship , she immigrated to the us in 1948 , but she never felt at home in ohio .
her husband had no family , and she was left to fend for herself while he went to work everyday .
the locals were far from welcoming .
“ they considered me the devil , i was known as the ' nazi girl ' , " she said .
" i was isolated , nobody talked to me .
it was like solitary confinement . "
gina r. , felt equally lonely in the states .
when she left germany in 1950 , she couldn ’ t believe how little her new american family in tulsa , oklahoma , talked to one another .
" they just sat in front of the television all the time ! " she said .
" i was never happy in the states because i felt so homesick , so after two years my husband and i moved back here .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .

according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .

not if it 's a big wet one planted by an icon of communist repression . erich honecker , communist east germany 's last leader , has been accused of a lot of evil things over the years : sustaining a totalitarian regime , stifling political dissent , giving shoot-to-kill orders to soldiers guarding the berlin wall , just to name a few .
but now , a contemporary of the east german despot has come out with an accusation that could really ruin a guy 's reputation .
apparently , honecker - who ruled the country from 1971 to 1989 - was a lousy kisser .
according to another east bloc autocrat , polish communist leader general wojciech jaruzelski , kissing honecker was " disgusting . "
jaruzelski , who was prime minister of poland from 1981 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1990 , told germany 's die welt newspaper that honecker always started meetings with hugs and fraternal , socialist pecks on the cheek .
" i exchanged many embraces with honecker , " jaruzelski said .
" he had this disgusting way of kissing . "
it seems honecker , who died in 1994 , never got word that swapping spit with the big brass was a turnoff .
the proof ?
reprints of photographs that show the grey-haired , bespectacled honecker kissing cheeks with soviet president leonid brezhnev or mikhail gorbachev are part of the popular culture in germany .
bildunterschrift : dmitri vrubel 's fresco of brezhnev and honecker kissing was based on an actual photo and artist dmitri vrubel 's picture of honecker and brezhnev kissing each other on the lips , painted on a section of the berlin wall , is one of berlin 's most popular tourist attractions .
unfortunately , it 's barely visible now as it 's been largely covered with graffiti - maybe by people grossed out by honecker 's wet mouth-to-mouth action . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when germans shot germans in a berlin courtroom this week , germany ended its ugliest chapter when a judge convicted four east german officers for their role in border deaths .

" turkey is scheduled to begin the accession talks in early october , but the membership process is widely expected to take at least a decade . schröder added that such important strategic decisions , such as entry into the eu , should not depend on ever-changing opinion polls .
while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid .

he noted that erdogan himself has implied that a " change in mentality " is necessary before the policies can be put into effect . " such a change in mentality wo n't take place overnight .
but it is necessary in order for reforms and changes in the law to become everyday , widely accepted practices , " schröder told the newspaper . ' difficult ' negotiations ahead the progress of the reform process will make a decisive difference in determining how the developments of the eu talks , schröder told the paper .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth .

acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now . " i do n't want to take my secret with me to the grave , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last witness recalls : i saw hitler dead rochus misch still remembers the sight as if it were yesterday : 60 years ago on saturday he looked through a doorway and saw adolf hitler had committed suicide .

while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid .

he noted that erdogan himself has implied that a " change in mentality " is necessary before the policies can be put into effect . " such a change in mentality wo n't take place overnight .

but thousands struck up relations with german women , and many of them fathered children they never knew . the official reason for the fraternization ban introduced in september 1944 was to punish german civilians , while maintaining the authority of the occupying forces and protecting them from the insidious force of nazi propaganda . in fact , it served another , more delicate purpose .
after landing in italy in 1943 , the allied armies had been badly weakened by the rapid spread of venereal disease brought about by the soldiers ' contact with prostitutes . american gis were warned against encounters with local women .
but it was to no avail - in the chaos of the postwar years , gis and german girls both needed each other . corned beef and cigarettes in 1945 , christa ronke was 16 years old and working at an officers ' mess hall in southwestern berlin .
" the gis had an eye for the girls ! " she said .
" at first they saw us all as nazis , but they soon relaxed .
and they seemed so well-off , so good-looking and casual - and they stood for the whole american way of life .
they were hard to resist ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " der blaue engel " after six years of a war which had left their own men either dead or physically and psychologically traumatized , the us servicemen were an irresistible draw for germany 's lonely , starving women . the men could get them corned beef and cigarettes - and show them a good time .
" they had chocolate and silk stockings , " said ronke .
" there were no german men left , but then suddenly there were all these young americans to go out dancing with .
they were n't like the russians , who were so scrawny and poor - compared , to them , even we germans had a lot .
it was the girls with american boyfriends who were envied . " whores and traitors " but the men coming back from the war hated it , " explained ronke .
to them , the german women were fraternizing with the enemy - exchanging sex for material gain .
punishments could be harsh - some women were publicly denounced as whores and traitors , others had their heads shaved , while some were even set on fire .
but it was a fact of life in the immediate aftermath of the war . " american soldiers together with german women was a common sight , " said ronke .
" they were crazy times . " bildunterschrift : an american gi flirts with german girls three out of four gis had sexual encounters overseas , and by late 1945 , one in five german babies was born out of wedlock .
by 1955 , up to 67,700 illegitimate children had been fathered by us soldiers - some 5,000 of whom were afro-american . the " occupation children " were a thorn in the side of adenauer 's germany - especially the high percentage of mixed-race children , many of whom were sent to the us for adoption in the ensuing years .
not least , they were a huge financial burden on the country .
us soldiers were exempt from having to pay child support unless they acknowledged paternity , and taxpayers had to bear the costs of the nation 's illegitimate children of gi fathers . life was hard for both the children and their abandoned mothers .
their lovers had made promises - marriage , a new life in the states - that were cruelly broken .
many belatedly found out their boyfriends had wives back home .
ostracized by society , these women and their children became the pariahs of postwar germany . bildunterschrift : orphaned children in post-war germany play during a break a happy end for some not all of the women who fell in love with gis suffered an unhappy end .
after the us congress lifted the fraternization ban and passed the war brides act in december 1945 , gis were free to marry their german sweethearts .
and they did so in droves .
in 1949 , some 13,000 marriages between german women and us servicemen took place .
between 1946 and 1949 , approximately 20,000 german women immigrated to the states .
the first batch of european war brides set sail for america aboard the " argentina , " a steamship specially fitted out with nurseries .
it marked the start of the largest single influx of mothers and infants into the us in two centuries . but domestic bliss it was n't .
maria m. was 16 when she met her gi husband in munich .
after a long courtship , she immigrated to the us in 1948 , but she never felt at home in ohio .
her husband had no family , and she was left to fend for herself while he went to work everyday .
the locals were far from welcoming .
“ they considered me the devil , i was known as the ' nazi girl ' , " she said .
" i was isolated , nobody talked to me .
it was like solitary confinement . "
gina r. , felt equally lonely in the states .
when she left germany in 1950 , she couldn ’ t believe how little her new american family in tulsa , oklahoma , talked to one another .
" they just sat in front of the television all the time ! " she said .

even before his papal incarnation , he was busy warning readers to steer clear of the imaginative world they so love on the grounds that it contains too much black magic . and now to add insult to injury , his own books have gone and knocked the latest harry potter book from top place in a german book chart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal tcarciso bertone while the book , harry potter and the half-blood prince , is not due for publication until july , fans are so fanatical that they reserved copies well in advance . but the german branch of the online book retailer amazon said the pope 's theological preachings have commandeered the first three places in its list of top 10 bestselling books . at number one is salt of the earth : christianity and the catholic church at the end of the millennium , a book of ratzinger 's interview with german journalist peter seewald , followed in second place by values in time of upheaval , and the self-explanatory introduction to christianity . master potter has thus been relegated to fourth place , but with a further four ratzinger titles in the top 10 , just how long he can hang on in there remains to be seen . knuckle-wrapping for conspiracy thriller j.k. rowling is not the only author to incur the wrath of the catholic church whilst simultaneously being affected by its sudden surge in popularity .
us author dan brown 's conspiracy thriller , the da vinci code , which was recently named book of the year at the british book awards , has also come under fire from the vatican . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bestseller " values in a time of upheaval " cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa , was appointed by the vatican to deny what it says are lies , distortions and mistakes in brown 's bestseller .
the book is based on the idea that the church long concealed the fact that jesus married former prostitute , mary magdalene and that she bore him a child . bertone said the book is filled with absurd and vulgar falsifications which are a clear attempt to discredit the church .
whatever the case , the book has been a massive success , selling more than 25 million copies in 45 languages worldwide . but whether it can weather the storm being created by the pope 's more purist works remains to be seen .
the climb in their popularity on the us amazon site is slower than that on its german subsidiary , but seven of the pontiff 's titles are already in the top 25 . # b # all this theological excitement is big business for a number of german publishers who are working round the clock to keep up with the unexpected demand .
books by and about the former cardinal had sold out in germany within just hours of his election and new print runs - complete with photos of pope benedict xvi in his papal robes - are in the tens of thousands , massively exceeding the original runs . it 's nothing short of a publisher 's paradise , and for the time being at least , there is no sign of waning interest . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's birthplace ecstatic as visitors flock residents of joseph ratzinger 's tiny birthplace of marktl in bavaria who have greeted his election as pope with unrestrained joy and partying now find themselves at the center of world attention .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2005 former nurse tells of hitler 's last days großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paranoia paralyzed hitler in the end a 93 year-old woman claiming to have been adolf hitler 's nurse in the final days of the third reich has spoken of her experiences in the berlin bunker for the first time in 60 years . many people have tried and failed to accurately portray or document the final hours of adolf hitler .
acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now .

acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now .

but thousands struck up relations with german women , and many of them fathered children they never knew . the official reason for the fraternization ban introduced in september 1944 was to punish german civilians , while maintaining the authority of the occupying forces and protecting them from the insidious force of nazi propaganda . in fact , it served another , more delicate purpose .
after landing in italy in 1943 , the allied armies had been badly weakened by the rapid spread of venereal disease brought about by the soldiers ' contact with prostitutes . american gis were warned against encounters with local women .
but it was to no avail - in the chaos of the postwar years , gis and german girls both needed each other . corned beef and cigarettes in 1945 , christa ronke was 16 years old and working at an officers ' mess hall in southwestern berlin .
" the gis had an eye for the girls ! " she said .
" at first they saw us all as nazis , but they soon relaxed .
and they seemed so well-off , so good-looking and casual - and they stood for the whole american way of life .
they were hard to resist ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " der blaue engel " after six years of a war which had left their own men either dead or physically and psychologically traumatized , the us servicemen were an irresistible draw for germany 's lonely , starving women . the men could get them corned beef and cigarettes - and show them a good time .
" they had chocolate and silk stockings , " said ronke .
" there were no german men left , but then suddenly there were all these young americans to go out dancing with .
they were n't like the russians , who were so scrawny and poor - compared , to them , even we germans had a lot .
it was the girls with american boyfriends who were envied . " whores and traitors " but the men coming back from the war hated it , " explained ronke .
to them , the german women were fraternizing with the enemy - exchanging sex for material gain .
punishments could be harsh - some women were publicly denounced as whores and traitors , others had their heads shaved , while some were even set on fire .
but it was a fact of life in the immediate aftermath of the war . " american soldiers together with german women was a common sight , " said ronke .
" they were crazy times . " bildunterschrift : an american gi flirts with german girls three out of four gis had sexual encounters overseas , and by late 1945 , one in five german babies was born out of wedlock .
by 1955 , up to 67,700 illegitimate children had been fathered by us soldiers - some 5,000 of whom were afro-american . the " occupation children " were a thorn in the side of adenauer 's germany - especially the high percentage of mixed-race children , many of whom were sent to the us for adoption in the ensuing years .
not least , they were a huge financial burden on the country .
us soldiers were exempt from having to pay child support unless they acknowledged paternity , and taxpayers had to bear the costs of the nation 's illegitimate children of gi fathers . life was hard for both the children and their abandoned mothers .
their lovers had made promises - marriage , a new life in the states - that were cruelly broken .
many belatedly found out their boyfriends had wives back home .
ostracized by society , these women and their children became the pariahs of postwar germany . bildunterschrift : orphaned children in post-war germany play during a break a happy end for some not all of the women who fell in love with gis suffered an unhappy end .
after the us congress lifted the fraternization ban and passed the war brides act in december 1945 , gis were free to marry their german sweethearts .
and they did so in droves .
in 1949 , some 13,000 marriages between german women and us servicemen took place .
between 1946 and 1949 , approximately 20,000 german women immigrated to the states .
the first batch of european war brides set sail for america aboard the " argentina , " a steamship specially fitted out with nurseries .
it marked the start of the largest single influx of mothers and infants into the us in two centuries . but domestic bliss it was n't .
maria m. was 16 when she met her gi husband in munich .
after a long courtship , she immigrated to the us in 1948 , but she never felt at home in ohio .
her husband had no family , and she was left to fend for herself while he went to work everyday .
the locals were far from welcoming .
“ they considered me the devil , i was known as the ' nazi girl ' , " she said .
" i was isolated , nobody talked to me .
it was like solitary confinement . "
gina r. , felt equally lonely in the states .
when she left germany in 1950 , she couldn ’ t believe how little her new american family in tulsa , oklahoma , talked to one another .
" they just sat in front of the television all the time ! " she said .
" i was never happy in the states because i felt so homesick , so after two years my husband and i moved back here .

even before his papal incarnation , he was busy warning readers to steer clear of the imaginative world they so love on the grounds that it contains too much black magic . and now to add insult to injury , his own books have gone and knocked the latest harry potter book from top place in a german book chart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal tcarciso bertone while the book , harry potter and the half-blood prince , is not due for publication until july , fans are so fanatical that they reserved copies well in advance . but the german branch of the online book retailer amazon said the pope 's theological preachings have commandeered the first three places in its list of top 10 bestselling books . at number one is salt of the earth : christianity and the catholic church at the end of the millennium , a book of ratzinger 's interview with german journalist peter seewald , followed in second place by values in time of upheaval , and the self-explanatory introduction to christianity . master potter has thus been relegated to fourth place , but with a further four ratzinger titles in the top 10 , just how long he can hang on in there remains to be seen . knuckle-wrapping for conspiracy thriller j.k. rowling is not the only author to incur the wrath of the catholic church whilst simultaneously being affected by its sudden surge in popularity .
us author dan brown 's conspiracy thriller , the da vinci code , which was recently named book of the year at the british book awards , has also come under fire from the vatican . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bestseller " values in a time of upheaval " cardinal tarcisio bertone , the archbishop of genoa , was appointed by the vatican to deny what it says are lies , distortions and mistakes in brown 's bestseller .
the book is based on the idea that the church long concealed the fact that jesus married former prostitute , mary magdalene and that she bore him a child . bertone said the book is filled with absurd and vulgar falsifications which are a clear attempt to discredit the church .
whatever the case , the book has been a massive success , selling more than 25 million copies in 45 languages worldwide . but whether it can weather the storm being created by the pope 's more purist works remains to be seen .
the climb in their popularity on the us amazon site is slower than that on its german subsidiary , but seven of the pontiff 's titles are already in the top 25 . # b # all this theological excitement is big business for a number of german publishers who are working round the clock to keep up with the unexpected demand .
books by and about the former cardinal had sold out in germany within just hours of his election and new print runs - complete with photos of pope benedict xvi in his papal robes - are in the tens of thousands , massively exceeding the original runs . it 's nothing short of a publisher 's paradise , and for the time being at least , there is no sign of waning interest . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's birthplace ecstatic as visitors flock residents of joseph ratzinger 's tiny birthplace of marktl in bavaria who have greeted his election as pope with unrestrained joy and partying now find themselves at the center of world attention .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth .

he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth . " i just want to know what my roots are , " he said . jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de war 's forgotten children break the silence the traces of world war ii have faded but not disappeared for germans .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

" turkey is scheduled to begin the accession talks in early october , but the membership process is widely expected to take at least a decade . schröder added that such important strategic decisions , such as entry into the eu , should not depend on ever-changing opinion polls .
while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid .

he noted that erdogan himself has implied that a " change in mentality " is necessary before the policies can be put into effect . " such a change in mentality wo n't take place overnight .

but thousands struck up relations with german women , and many of them fathered children they never knew . the official reason for the fraternization ban introduced in september 1944 was to punish german civilians , while maintaining the authority of the occupying forces and protecting them from the insidious force of nazi propaganda . in fact , it served another , more delicate purpose .
after landing in italy in 1943 , the allied armies had been badly weakened by the rapid spread of venereal disease brought about by the soldiers ' contact with prostitutes . american gis were warned against encounters with local women .
but it was to no avail - in the chaos of the postwar years , gis and german girls both needed each other . corned beef and cigarettes in 1945 , christa ronke was 16 years old and working at an officers ' mess hall in southwestern berlin .
" the gis had an eye for the girls ! " she said .

" there were no german men left , but then suddenly there were all these young americans to go out dancing with .
they were n't like the russians , who were so scrawny and poor - compared , to them , even we germans had a lot .

not if it 's a big wet one planted by an icon of communist repression . erich honecker , communist east germany 's last leader , has been accused of a lot of evil things over the years : sustaining a totalitarian regime , stifling political dissent , giving shoot-to-kill orders to soldiers guarding the berlin wall , just to name a few .
but now , a contemporary of the east german despot has come out with an accusation that could really ruin a guy 's reputation .
apparently , honecker - who ruled the country from 1971 to 1989 - was a lousy kisser .
according to another east bloc autocrat , polish communist leader general wojciech jaruzelski , kissing honecker was " disgusting . "
jaruzelski , who was prime minister of poland from 1981 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1990 , told germany 's die welt newspaper that honecker always started meetings with hugs and fraternal , socialist pecks on the cheek .
" i exchanged many embraces with honecker , " jaruzelski said .
" he had this disgusting way of kissing . "
it seems honecker , who died in 1994 , never got word that swapping spit with the big brass was a turnoff .
the proof ?
reprints of photographs that show the grey-haired , bespectacled honecker kissing cheeks with soviet president leonid brezhnev or mikhail gorbachev are part of the popular culture in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2005 former nurse tells of hitler 's last days großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paranoia paralyzed hitler in the end a 93 year-old woman claiming to have been adolf hitler 's nurse in the final days of the third reich has spoken of her experiences in the berlin bunker for the first time in 60 years . many people have tried and failed to accurately portray or document the final hours of adolf hitler .
acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now . " i do n't want to take my secret with me to the grave , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last witness recalls : i saw hitler dead rochus misch still remembers the sight as if it were yesterday : 60 years ago on saturday he looked through a doorway and saw adolf hitler had committed suicide .

the book is based on the idea that the church long concealed the fact that jesus married former prostitute , mary magdalene and that she bore him a child . bertone said the book is filled with absurd and vulgar falsifications which are a clear attempt to discredit the church .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now . " i do n't want to take my secret with me to the grave , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last witness recalls : i saw hitler dead rochus misch still remembers the sight as if it were yesterday : 60 years ago on saturday he looked through a doorway and saw adolf hitler had committed suicide .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .

acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .

" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2005 former nurse tells of hitler 's last days großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paranoia paralyzed hitler in the end a 93 year-old woman claiming to have been adolf hitler 's nurse in the final days of the third reich has spoken of her experiences in the berlin bunker for the first time in 60 years . many people have tried and failed to accurately portray or document the final hours of adolf hitler .
acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now . " i do n't want to take my secret with me to the grave , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last witness recalls : i saw hitler dead rochus misch still remembers the sight as if it were yesterday : 60 years ago on saturday he looked through a doorway and saw adolf hitler had committed suicide .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2005 the allies ’ human legacy lives on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1955 up to 67,700 children had been fathered by us soldiers in the decades following world war ii , an entire generation of occupation children grew up not knowing their fathers .
to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth .

acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now .

after the meeting , schröder said turkey had " clear prospects " for eventual entry into the eu . turkey 's accession to the european union is a central topic for schröder 's brief trip to turkey .
the german leader arrived in ankara on tuesday evening and had an inofficial , private meeting with erdogan . on wednesday , after early-morning official talks with the prime minister , schröder said at a press conference that turkey was on the road to eu membership , but that the country needed to maintain the dynamic of the reforms brussels says are necessary if the negotiations are to begin " promptly on october 3 . " turkey is scheduled to begin the accession talks in early october , but the membership process is widely expected to take at least a decade . schröder added that such important strategic decisions , such as entry into the eu , should not depend on ever-changing opinion polls .
while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid . " the reforms must be further implemented , and we should be assured of their irreversibility , " schröder told the turkish daily milliyet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's flag and those of other eu candidates flew in brussels he was referring especially to reforms affecting fundamental freedoms , as well as minority and human rights .
in the past weeks , prime minister erdogan has been accused of letting his country 's reform efforts lose momentum . however , on the eve of this visit , schröder praised the " impressive reform policies " of the turkish government .
he noted that erdogan himself has implied that a " change in mentality " is necessary before the policies can be put into effect . " such a change in mentality wo n't take place overnight .
but it is necessary in order for reforms and changes in the law to become everyday , widely accepted practices , " schröder told the newspaper . ' difficult ' negotiations ahead the progress of the reform process will make a decisive difference in determining how the developments of the eu talks , schröder told the paper .
" the negotiations themselves will certainly be long and also difficult . " the chancellor noted that turkey needs to enlarge its eu tariff agreements with the new member states by october 3 - which will mean a de facto recognition of cyprus by ankara . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish newspapers celebrated the accession accord talks " a speedy solution to the cyprus problem would of course make the accession talks much easier , » schröder said .
schröder agreed with turkey 's suggestion of forming a history commission to handle discussions of the massacre of armenians 90 years ago , in what was then known as the ottoman empire . business and church schröder will also meet president ahmet necdet sezer before heading to istanbul on wednesday , where he is scheduled to meet the spiritual leader of the orthodox church , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. he will also attend a german-turkish economic forum in istanbul . with 2.5 million people of turkish origin living within its borders , germany is turkey 's main economic partner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

" fans from all over europe want fairer access to these tickets , especially as it may be many years before the world cup will be back in europe , " she added in a statement . the british consumer group made a formal complaint to the european commission in march in which it accused fifa , the german football league and mastercard of " anti-competitive " ticketing arrangements that breach european law . consumer group complained of discrimination which ? claimed that the ticket system for 2006 world cup discriminated against fans outside germany and contravened the eu 's own competition rules , adding that the deal struck between the three entities was anti-competitive and put soccer fans in britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as imposing additional and unnecessary costs on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the original rules , tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament could be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 -lrb- 44 euros , $ 59 -rrb- - or via a german bank account .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

" turkey is scheduled to begin the accession talks in early october , but the membership process is widely expected to take at least a decade . schröder added that such important strategic decisions , such as entry into the eu , should not depend on ever-changing opinion polls .
while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid .

" the negotiations themselves will certainly be long and also difficult . " the chancellor noted that turkey needs to enlarge its eu tariff agreements with the new member states by october 3 - which will mean a de facto recognition of cyprus by ankara . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish newspapers celebrated the accession accord talks " a speedy solution to the cyprus problem would of course make the accession talks much easier , » schröder said .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

not if it 's a big wet one planted by an icon of communist repression . erich honecker , communist east germany 's last leader , has been accused of a lot of evil things over the years : sustaining a totalitarian regime , stifling political dissent , giving shoot-to-kill orders to soldiers guarding the berlin wall , just to name a few .
but now , a contemporary of the east german despot has come out with an accusation that could really ruin a guy 's reputation .
apparently , honecker - who ruled the country from 1971 to 1989 - was a lousy kisser .
according to another east bloc autocrat , polish communist leader general wojciech jaruzelski , kissing honecker was " disgusting . "
jaruzelski , who was prime minister of poland from 1981 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1990 , told germany 's die welt newspaper that honecker always started meetings with hugs and fraternal , socialist pecks on the cheek .
" i exchanged many embraces with honecker , " jaruzelski said .
" he had this disgusting way of kissing . "

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .

compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .

that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2005 the allies ’ human legacy lives on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by 1955 up to 67,700 children had been fathered by us soldiers in the decades following world war ii , an entire generation of occupation children grew up not knowing their fathers .
to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .

twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .

tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .

twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .

" fans from all over europe want fairer access to these tickets , especially as it may be many years before the world cup will be back in europe , " she added in a statement . the british consumer group made a formal complaint to the european commission in march in which it accused fifa , the german football league and mastercard of " anti-competitive " ticketing arrangements that breach european law . consumer group complained of discrimination which ? claimed that the ticket system for 2006 world cup discriminated against fans outside germany and contravened the eu 's own competition rules , adding that the deal struck between the three entities was anti-competitive and put soccer fans in britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as imposing additional and unnecessary costs on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the original rules , tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament could be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 -lrb- 44 euros , $ 59 -rrb- - or via a german bank account .
fans who did not use these methods of payment would not have their applications for tickets processed . new bank accounts for non-euro zone countries under the new arrangements , fifa and the german football association will open bank accounts in the 16 non-euro zone countries which are members of the european economic area -lrb- eaa -rrb- , and accept payments in the local currency .
this will include cyprus , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , hungary , iceland , latvia , liechtenstein , lithuania , malta , norway , poland , slovakia , slovenia , sweden and the united kingdom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa change of payment system applies to the second sales period of tickets for the 2006 world cup in germany , which began monday with a closing date of november 15 . the ticketing system has been under fire ever since it was revealed .
as well as complaints surrounding distribution , the system has been criticized for its complexity and has also been the subject of alleged fraud and the target for internet black marketeers . in total 2.93 million world cup tickets are on sale to the general public and a first batch of 812,000 tickets were sold in the first sales period . ticket prices range from 35 euros to 600 euros for soccer 's biggest showpiece running from june 9 until july 9 , 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second phase of world cup ticket sales opens just days after the first world cup tickets were allocated to their lucky recipients , fifa and the german organizing committee kicked off the second phase comprising special team specific tickets .

flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .

" we expect that he will fly to the iss in september when the second shuttle is sent into orbit and will return in to earth in february 2006 , also with the shuttle crew , " roskosmos representative vyacheslav davidenko was quoted as saying .
reiter was to become the first european citizen to fly a long-term mission to the iss in july but shuttle launches were delayed by the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- last week to avoid a repeat of the deadly 2003 columbia disaster .
reiter has been training for the mission in a facility near moscow since november with russian and american astronauts who are scheduled to fly an earlier shuttle mission to the iss .
nasa officials have been cautious since determining that a stray piece of insulating foam pierced columbia 's protective outer skin on lift-off feb.1 , 2003 , leading to its disintegration and the death of all seven astronauts on board when the damaged shuttle re-entered the earth 's atmosphere .
the us space agency 's three other shuttles have been grounded ever since the accident . dw-world.de utter garbage in outer space tens of thousands of objects like old spacecrafts and satellites pose a severe problem for space travel .

not if it 's a big wet one planted by an icon of communist repression . erich honecker , communist east germany 's last leader , has been accused of a lot of evil things over the years : sustaining a totalitarian regime , stifling political dissent , giving shoot-to-kill orders to soldiers guarding the berlin wall , just to name a few .
but now , a contemporary of the east german despot has come out with an accusation that could really ruin a guy 's reputation .
apparently , honecker - who ruled the country from 1971 to 1989 - was a lousy kisser .
according to another east bloc autocrat , polish communist leader general wojciech jaruzelski , kissing honecker was " disgusting . "
jaruzelski , who was prime minister of poland from 1981 to 1985 and president from 1985 to 1990 , told germany 's die welt newspaper that honecker always started meetings with hugs and fraternal , socialist pecks on the cheek .
" i exchanged many embraces with honecker , " jaruzelski said .
" he had this disgusting way of kissing . "
it seems honecker , who died in 1994 , never got word that swapping spit with the big brass was a turnoff .
the proof ?
reprints of photographs that show the grey-haired , bespectacled honecker kissing cheeks with soviet president leonid brezhnev or mikhail gorbachev are part of the popular culture in germany .

" fans from all over europe want fairer access to these tickets , especially as it may be many years before the world cup will be back in europe , " she added in a statement . the british consumer group made a formal complaint to the european commission in march in which it accused fifa , the german football league and mastercard of " anti-competitive " ticketing arrangements that breach european law . consumer group complained of discrimination which ? claimed that the ticket system for 2006 world cup discriminated against fans outside germany and contravened the eu 's own competition rules , adding that the deal struck between the three entities was anti-competitive and put soccer fans in britain and around europe at a disadvantage , as well as imposing additional and unnecessary costs on them . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the original rules , tickets for matches in the early stages of the tournament could be bought only by using mastercard , one of the sponsors , or by sending cash via a bank transfer - which can cost up to £ 30 -lrb- 44 euros , $ 59 -rrb- - or via a german bank account .
fans who did not use these methods of payment would not have their applications for tickets processed . new bank accounts for non-euro zone countries under the new arrangements , fifa and the german football association will open bank accounts in the 16 non-euro zone countries which are members of the european economic area -lrb- eaa -rrb- , and accept payments in the local currency .
this will include cyprus , the czech republic , denmark , estonia , hungary , iceland , latvia , liechtenstein , lithuania , malta , norway , poland , slovakia , slovenia , sweden and the united kingdom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fifa change of payment system applies to the second sales period of tickets for the 2006 world cup in germany , which began monday with a closing date of november 15 . the ticketing system has been under fire ever since it was revealed .
as well as complaints surrounding distribution , the system has been criticized for its complexity and has also been the subject of alleged fraud and the target for internet black marketeers . in total 2.93 million world cup tickets are on sale to the general public and a first batch of 812,000 tickets were sold in the first sales period . ticket prices range from 35 euros to 600 euros for soccer 's biggest showpiece running from june 9 until july 9 , 2006 . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second phase of world cup ticket sales opens just days after the first world cup tickets were allocated to their lucky recipients , fifa and the german organizing committee kicked off the second phase comprising special team specific tickets .

11 , 2001 attacks on the united states .
the first flight , operated by us airline delta , from new york 's jfk international airport , touched down at berlin-tegel airport on tuesday morning before returning in the opposite direction a few hours later .
germany 's national carrier lufthansa was the last airline to offer flights to new york , but the berlin-new york route has been seen as unprofitable since passenger number dropped following the 2001 attacks .
however , delta is reporting strong bookings for its new service with the business class sections of planes already 80 percent full for the first three months , the airline 's vice president jim whitehurst said in a press conference in berlin .
delta 's rival continental airlines is to offer a daily service to newark , new jersey , in the metropolitan new york area , from july 1 .
berlin mayor klaus wowereit said the new service would " eliminate the disadvantage " berlin suffered from lacking a direct flight to new york .
negotiations are currently under way to provide direct flights from the german capital to hong kong and shanghai .
passengers flying from berlin currently have to change at frankfurt or other german airports before making long-haul flights . dw-world.de berlin international airport on hold plans to expand an international airport near berlin to create a new hub for the german capital hit a setback when a federal court upheld a complaint by residents in the area .

even before his papal incarnation , he was busy warning readers to steer clear of the imaginative world they so love on the grounds that it contains too much black magic . and now to add insult to injury , his own books have gone and knocked the latest harry potter book from top place in a german book chart . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal tcarciso bertone while the book , harry potter and the half-blood prince , is not due for publication until july , fans are so fanatical that they reserved copies well in advance . but the german branch of the online book retailer amazon said the pope 's theological preachings have commandeered the first three places in its list of top 10 bestselling books . at number one is salt of the earth : christianity and the catholic church at the end of the millennium , a book of ratzinger 's interview with german journalist peter seewald , followed in second place by values in time of upheaval , and the self-explanatory introduction to christianity . master potter has thus been relegated to fourth place , but with a further four ratzinger titles in the top 10 , just how long he can hang on in there remains to be seen . knuckle-wrapping for conspiracy thriller j.k. rowling is not the only author to incur the wrath of the catholic church whilst simultaneously being affected by its sudden surge in popularity .

the book is based on the idea that the church long concealed the fact that jesus married former prostitute , mary magdalene and that she bore him a child . bertone said the book is filled with absurd and vulgar falsifications which are a clear attempt to discredit the church .
whatever the case , the book has been a massive success , selling more than 25 million copies in 45 languages worldwide . but whether it can weather the storm being created by the pope 's more purist works remains to be seen .
the climb in their popularity on the us amazon site is slower than that on its german subsidiary , but seven of the pontiff 's titles are already in the top 25 . # b # all this theological excitement is big business for a number of german publishers who are working round the clock to keep up with the unexpected demand .
books by and about the former cardinal had sold out in germany within just hours of his election and new print runs - complete with photos of pope benedict xvi in his papal robes - are in the tens of thousands , massively exceeding the original runs . it 's nothing short of a publisher 's paradise , and for the time being at least , there is no sign of waning interest . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's birthplace ecstatic as visitors flock residents of joseph ratzinger 's tiny birthplace of marktl in bavaria who have greeted his election as pope with unrestrained joy and partying now find themselves at the center of world attention .

trend micro placed the virus in its ' red alert ' category , saying that " using social engineering techniques , it sends out an email supposedly sent by the soccer organization fifa , " offering tickets to the tournament .
us firm mcafee classified the virus as a " medium risk , " saying the e-mail message , written in german , " specifically targets german users . "
but trend micro and panda software said the virus could be spread in either english or german .
panda said it had attacked computers in austria , germany , switzerland and the united states .
the e-mail includes correct contact information for a fifa official .
a previous version of the " sober " virus made users think that their private e-mails had gone to the wrong address , prompting them to open an infected attachment .
world cup organizers also warned online ticket buyers to beware of a virus embedded in an attachment telling them they have won places for next year 's tournament .
fans have been warned not to open messages from ticket @ fifa.de or gewinn @ fifa.de. dw-world.de police call ' sasser ' programmer a bottom-feeding hacker an investigation into the suspected 18-year-old programmer of sasser offers a view of a hacking subculture that poses a serious threat because of its adherents ' inexperience .

acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now . " i do n't want to take my secret with me to the grave , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last witness recalls : i saw hitler dead rochus misch still remembers the sight as if it were yesterday : 60 years ago on saturday he looked through a doorway and saw adolf hitler had committed suicide .

it said france had taken " a dangerous step backwards " by creating new press offenses punishable by prison sentences . the organization also expressed concern about " extra powers of requisition " granted in 2004 to police , state prosecutors and examining magistrates , which do not require a judge to be present during searches of journalists ' homes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top marks for scandinavian reporters the report described the ' perben law ' , named after french justice minister dominique perben , " a major threat to the privacy of sources and to independent and investigative journalists who keep a lot of material in their homes " . on a more upbeat note , the paris-based watchdog had high praise for scandinavia , which it described as a region in which press freedom is " sacrosanct " and " strongly protected and defended by law " . italy is a " special case " in italy , the group singled out the conflict between prime minister silvio berlusconi 's political and personal financial interests as a " special case " on the continent , but also attacked the italian courts for hindering press freedom . berlusconi 's -lrb- photo -rrb- position as both head of government and a media empire that includes three of italy 's four private tv networks " continues to threaten the media 's independence , " the report said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian premier silvio berlusconi but it saved its sharpest rebukes for the country 's judiciary , hitting out at ongoing prison sentences for media offences and what it said were efforts by the italian courts to strip the right not to reveal journalistic sources .
reporters without borders said the restrictive libel laws in france and italy led journalists to engage in self-censorship . the report said that turkey , which is due to begin european union membership talks in october , has made improvements to its media laws in line with eu demands , but added that arbitrary imprisonments still force journalists to practise self-censorship . a need for safe havens reporters without borders praised the balkan states for making improvements to press freedoms , although one journalist was killed in serbia-montenegro last year .
a total of 53 reporters lost their lives and 100 more were imprisoned in 2004 , statistics which prove the need for safe havens for persecuted writers . one such project is " writers in exile " , which is run by the pen centre in germany .
michael klaus , who oversees the project says it is crucial for writers who have been imprisoned in their home countries , to be able to leave once they are released .
" we know that writers who have been imprisoned once face the threat of being arrested again soon their release , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pen : poets , essayists , novelists , was founded in england in the 20s " writers in exile " , which is funded by the german government , offers six persecuted writers the chance of a safe haven in one of five cities around the country .
they can stay as long as they feel the need to , which for some is just six months , but for the majority turns into a period of several years . it is not simply a question of providing writers with a peaceful environment from which to pen their thoughts , but a matter of all-round support .
" many writers have been through traumatic experiences such as torture or mock executions , " klaus said .
" for the first six months it 's a matter of re-equipping them with an ability to survive . " besides pen , amnesty international , the hamburg foundation for the politically persecuted and the heinrich-böll foundation also support hounded writers . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when freedom gets the death sentence the murder of a turkish woman and the applauding of the crime by some students have left berlin shaken and officials pushing for ethics class .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.05.2005 former nurse tells of hitler 's last days großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paranoia paralyzed hitler in the end a 93 year-old woman claiming to have been adolf hitler 's nurse in the final days of the third reich has spoken of her experiences in the berlin bunker for the first time in 60 years . many people have tried and failed to accurately portray or document the final hours of adolf hitler .
acclaimed attempts such as the recent successful german film " der untergang " -lrb- the downfall -rrb- have made the most of the knowledge which is available and have mixed established facts and speculation to great effect . but there have been very few corroborative first hand accounts that have revealed the true inner workings of the führer 's bunker and his mindset as his master plan came crashing down around him . until now , possibly .
according to the berlin-based daily berliner zeitung , a survivor from hitler 's berlin stronghold has decided to break her silence over what she saw and heard in the final days of the third reich . erna flegel , a 93-year-old , claims to have been the nazi leader 's nurse at the end of world war ii and to have been in his bunker when hitler took his own life . under the headline " i was hitler 's nurse " , flegel tells a fascinating and tragic story of how she provided medical treatment to hitler and his inner circle from 1943 until the nazi leadership gave up their dogged resistance and hope in the face of the advancing red army and allied forces two years later . flegel 's insight into the last days reveals that contemporary accounts have been more or less accurate concerning the mental state of the führer . hitler paralyzed by paranoia in last days bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : adolf hitler did n't even trust his own cyanide capsules at the end the former nurse revealed in the interview that hitler was almost paralyzed with paranoia as the end neared , even fearing that the cyanide capsules with which he was planning to take his own life had been switched and filled with fake poison .
" by the end , he did n't trust anyone any more - not even the cyanide capsule he swallowed , " she is quoted as saying in the paper . conflicting reports suggest that only hitler 's wife eva took cyanide while the nazi leader himself died from a self-inflicted gunshot to the head .
both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .
it was then that the nazi hierarchy within the bunker began to implode . " -lrb- hitler 's -rrb- last subordinates shot themselves in succession , " she said .
" and those who did n't shoot themselves tried to flee . "
still flegel remained underground .
" i had to look after the wounded , " she added . red army approach heralded the final collapse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the soviet army stormed berlin from the east in the interview , she remembers the approach of the soviet army and the realization that hitler 's brutal regime and his plans for world domination were ending in the dust and rubble of berlin above .
" you could feel that the third reich was coming to an end , " she said .
" the radios stopped working and it was impossible to get information . " she recalled that the russians treated her well and advised her to remain where she was and to keep the door closed and locked .
flegel stayed for several more days in the bunker and was one of the last to leave .
she was then interviewed by us secret service agents , the last time that she spoke about her life as hitler 's nurse until now . " i do n't want to take my secret with me to the grave , " she said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the last witness recalls : i saw hitler dead rochus misch still remembers the sight as if it were yesterday : 60 years ago on saturday he looked through a doorway and saw adolf hitler had committed suicide .

both bodies were allegedly burned by aides shortly after being discovered . after hitler committed suicide , flegel stayed in the bunker as the nazi regime crumbled around her .
flegel said that after hitler 's suicide , josef goebbels , the nazi propaganda chief , took over as leader , but by then there was little sense of command and goebbels was ignored . a witness to the desperate end of the third reich she also revealed her desperate attempts to save goebbels ' six children from magda , their " merciless " mother , but was ultimately powerless as she poisoned them .

schröder said bosnia herzegovina had made visible progress in implementing domestic reform , including cooperation with the war crimes tribunal in the hague .
the chancellor said he was in favor of speedily establishing closer ties between the european union and sarajevo and negotiations with brussels about a stability pact . schröder also offered the bosnian leadership german expertise in framing a new constitution and aiding economic reform .
bosnian prime minister terzic said schröder 's visit had sent a " clear signal " about the place of his country in the eu fold . the german chancellor also met with srebrenica widows who lost their loved ones during the 1995 srebrenica massacre . careful progress earlier , diplomats talked about the painstaking progress that the balkan country has made in the years since the war . almost ten years after the war , bosnia herzegovina is still a torn country , with some 300,000 refugees who do n't want to return to their home villages for fear of their former neighbors .
war-ravaged houses dot the landscape , and buildings in sarajevo are testimony to the years of fighting which pounded the city . but there has been progress since the ceasefire in the mid-90s .
after significant resistance , the serb government in banja luka is now working with the federation of bosnia and herzegovina , with muslims and croats , in sarajevo . there is still much scepticism between the former warring factions , and the german diplomat , werner wnendt , said it took much international pressure to get the republica srpska to sign up to co-operating with its former enemies . " many people still have their old dreams of independence or of becoming affiliated to serbia , but there are also realistic politicians who recognise that the only option is to work within the state of bosnia-herzegovina , " wnendt said . shifting power bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , paddy ashdown wnendt is deputy to paddy ashdown -lrb- photo -rrb- , the high representative for bosnia and herzegovina , who is currently more powerful than any bosnian politician .
that said , the international community is keen to gradually transfer power to local authorities .
there is already a centralized defense ministry and secret service , and there are plans to create a single army and police force . such co-operation is a pre-condition to any notion of talks on bosnia and herzegovina joining the european union .
it created a stability and association agreement , which could smooth the way for accession talks at some point in the future .
but as things stand , wnendt says bosnia is making life more difficult for itself than needs be . " the structure in bosnia and herzegovina is very complicated and uneconomical because there are far too many ministers .
the need for reforms becomes more and more evident , " he added . need for greater foreign investment however , a number of foreign companies have already invested in the country .
a vw plant , once home to the manufacture of the company 's golf models , now employs more than 300 people for the production of replacement parts for older vw models . although there are other signs of foreign finance in bosnia and herzegovina , such as a slovenian supermarket chain and a croatian bank , overseas investment only adds up to a few hundred million annually .
compared to other balkan states it is very little , something which is reflected in the 40 percent unemployment rate . war criminals still on the run during the balkan war , bosnia was the place where the war raged for the longest , and there are still some 7,000 foreign soldiers stationed there in the name of peace and stability .
but a decade after the massacre at srebrenica , during which some 7,000 muslim men are believed to have been killed , the international troops have still not managed to arrest those responsible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic the former leader of the bosnian serbs , radovan karadzic -lrb- photo -rrb- and his commander , ratko mladic , are still on the run , and it is widely believed that karadzic is in republica srpska .
until such time as he is arrested , bosnia 's entry into the eu is unimaginable .
outside the ranks of the union , there would be little prospect of further foreign investment , which would in turn pain a bleak future for a county with an already dark past . gerwald herter -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de milosevic begins war crimes defense ex-yugoslav president slobodan milosevic began his defense against charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity before a united nations court on tuesday , denouncing the accusations as " unscrupulous lies .

tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .

he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .

after the meeting , schröder said turkey had " clear prospects " for eventual entry into the eu . turkey 's accession to the european union is a central topic for schröder 's brief trip to turkey .
the german leader arrived in ankara on tuesday evening and had an inofficial , private meeting with erdogan . on wednesday , after early-morning official talks with the prime minister , schröder said at a press conference that turkey was on the road to eu membership , but that the country needed to maintain the dynamic of the reforms brussels says are necessary if the negotiations are to begin " promptly on october 3 . " turkey is scheduled to begin the accession talks in early october , but the membership process is widely expected to take at least a decade . schröder added that such important strategic decisions , such as entry into the eu , should not depend on ever-changing opinion polls .
while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid .

he noted that erdogan himself has implied that a " change in mentality " is necessary before the policies can be put into effect . " such a change in mentality wo n't take place overnight .
but it is necessary in order for reforms and changes in the law to become everyday , widely accepted practices , " schröder told the newspaper . ' difficult ' negotiations ahead the progress of the reform process will make a decisive difference in determining how the developments of the eu talks , schröder told the paper .
" the negotiations themselves will certainly be long and also difficult . " the chancellor noted that turkey needs to enlarge its eu tariff agreements with the new member states by october 3 - which will mean a de facto recognition of cyprus by ankara . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish newspapers celebrated the accession accord talks " a speedy solution to the cyprus problem would of course make the accession talks much easier , » schröder said .
schröder agreed with turkey 's suggestion of forming a history commission to handle discussions of the massacre of armenians 90 years ago , in what was then known as the ottoman empire . business and church schröder will also meet president ahmet necdet sezer before heading to istanbul on wednesday , where he is scheduled to meet the spiritual leader of the orthodox church , ecumenical patriarch bartholomew i. he will also attend a german-turkish economic forum in istanbul . with 2.5 million people of turkish origin living within its borders , germany is turkey 's main economic partner . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armenian massacre clouds turkey 's eu bid tens of thousands of armenians including the president and top officials filed through the towering genocide memorial in yerevan on sunday to commemorate the 90th anniversary of mass killings by ottoman turks .

" turkey is scheduled to begin the accession talks in early october , but the membership process is widely expected to take at least a decade . schröder added that such important strategic decisions , such as entry into the eu , should not depend on ever-changing opinion polls .
while just a short time ago , some 80 percent of the turkish populace was in favor of eu membership , that number has recently dropped to 60 percent . reforms crucial before schröder left for turkey , he told a turkish newspaper that the continuation of reforms in turkey was crucial to the success of the country 's eu bid .

but thousands struck up relations with german women , and many of them fathered children they never knew . the official reason for the fraternization ban introduced in september 1944 was to punish german civilians , while maintaining the authority of the occupying forces and protecting them from the insidious force of nazi propaganda . in fact , it served another , more delicate purpose .
after landing in italy in 1943 , the allied armies had been badly weakened by the rapid spread of venereal disease brought about by the soldiers ' contact with prostitutes . american gis were warned against encounters with local women .
but it was to no avail - in the chaos of the postwar years , gis and german girls both needed each other . corned beef and cigarettes in 1945 , christa ronke was 16 years old and working at an officers ' mess hall in southwestern berlin .
" the gis had an eye for the girls ! " she said .
" at first they saw us all as nazis , but they soon relaxed .
and they seemed so well-off , so good-looking and casual - and they stood for the whole american way of life .
they were hard to resist ! " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich in " der blaue engel " after six years of a war which had left their own men either dead or physically and psychologically traumatized , the us servicemen were an irresistible draw for germany 's lonely , starving women . the men could get them corned beef and cigarettes - and show them a good time .
" they had chocolate and silk stockings , " said ronke .
" there were no german men left , but then suddenly there were all these young americans to go out dancing with .
they were n't like the russians , who were so scrawny and poor - compared , to them , even we germans had a lot .
it was the girls with american boyfriends who were envied . " whores and traitors " but the men coming back from the war hated it , " explained ronke .
to them , the german women were fraternizing with the enemy - exchanging sex for material gain .
punishments could be harsh - some women were publicly denounced as whores and traitors , others had their heads shaved , while some were even set on fire .
but it was a fact of life in the immediate aftermath of the war . " american soldiers together with german women was a common sight , " said ronke .
" they were crazy times . " bildunterschrift : an american gi flirts with german girls three out of four gis had sexual encounters overseas , and by late 1945 , one in five german babies was born out of wedlock .
by 1955 , up to 67,700 illegitimate children had been fathered by us soldiers - some 5,000 of whom were afro-american . the " occupation children " were a thorn in the side of adenauer 's germany - especially the high percentage of mixed-race children , many of whom were sent to the us for adoption in the ensuing years .
not least , they were a huge financial burden on the country .
us soldiers were exempt from having to pay child support unless they acknowledged paternity , and taxpayers had to bear the costs of the nation 's illegitimate children of gi fathers . life was hard for both the children and their abandoned mothers .
their lovers had made promises - marriage , a new life in the states - that were cruelly broken .
many belatedly found out their boyfriends had wives back home .
ostracized by society , these women and their children became the pariahs of postwar germany . bildunterschrift : orphaned children in post-war germany play during a break a happy end for some not all of the women who fell in love with gis suffered an unhappy end .
after the us congress lifted the fraternization ban and passed the war brides act in december 1945 , gis were free to marry their german sweethearts .
and they did so in droves .
in 1949 , some 13,000 marriages between german women and us servicemen took place .
between 1946 and 1949 , approximately 20,000 german women immigrated to the states .
the first batch of european war brides set sail for america aboard the " argentina , " a steamship specially fitted out with nurseries .
it marked the start of the largest single influx of mothers and infants into the us in two centuries . but domestic bliss it was n't .
maria m. was 16 when she met her gi husband in munich .
after a long courtship , she immigrated to the us in 1948 , but she never felt at home in ohio .
her husband had no family , and she was left to fend for herself while he went to work everyday .
the locals were far from welcoming .
“ they considered me the devil , i was known as the ' nazi girl ' , " she said .
" i was isolated , nobody talked to me .
it was like solitary confinement . "
gina r. , felt equally lonely in the states .
when she left germany in 1950 , she couldn ’ t believe how little her new american family in tulsa , oklahoma , talked to one another .
" they just sat in front of the television all the time ! " she said .
" i was never happy in the states because i felt so homesick , so after two years my husband and i moved back here .

to this day , there is no legal agreement between germany and the us regarding paternity claims . the real victims of fraternization between german women and american gis were the thousands of illegitimate children born in the post-war years .
even 60 years after the end of the war , there exists no binding legal agreement between the us and germany concerning the occupation children , even though american fathers theoretically owe the german mothers of their children child support worth millions . for these children , however , the real loss is not knowing who their father was or having any contact to him or his family .
as they grow older , many of the occupation children have begun to search for answers about their birth .
tracing the tentative lines of paternity back to the united states , is difficult and quite often frustrating , as franz anthoefer , born in 1951 experienced all too well .. like many of the children fathered by occupying soldiers , anthoefer grew up in an orphanage in germany without knowing his father .
" in germany in the 1950s , if you were an unwed mother , the state usually took custody of your child , " he explained .
his father , an american stationed in rastadt , had wanted to marry his mother .
" but as soon as a serviceman got a woman pregnant , he would be transferred , and the army would refuse to pass on any information , " he said .
" if you kept asking , they would maintain they no longer had any records . " legal obstacles as a teenager , anthoefer was determined to locate his father .
" the american authorities deliberately gave me misleading information , " he said .
" they just gave me the runaround . "
in 1971 , he got a visa to visit the us and finally tracked down his father .
but it was too late .
he discovered his father , the mayor of a small town in west virginia , had died just weeks previously -lrb- photo -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz anthoefer at the grave of his american father in west virginia after collecting enough evidence to convince the german courts this man was indeed his father , germany recognized the paternity claim , although the us did n't .
twenty years later , anthoefer went to court and got permission to have his father 's body exhumed for dna testing .
he had to wait three years for the result , and in the meantime , he was arrested as an illegal immigrant and deported . today , he is still barred entry to the states , which means he can not pursue his quest to prove his parentage . " if i can prove i am my father 's son , then i am an american citizen , " he said .
" it 's the only connection i have to my father - the inheritance of his nationality .
i belong to nowhere , and all i want is american citizenship .
that 's all i want . " karl-heinz kamann feels the same .
born in 1945 , he grew up with his mother and her husband , after his gi father was transferred to japan .
he never understood why the neighborhood children jeered at him for being a " yank " - or why even his own family made him feel guilty , all the while " enjoying the food and presents they received from the american soldier " who 'd stayed in touch with his mother .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a standard care package sent by americans to germany in the post-war years contained food for 10 days .
even so , he never met his father , and it was only after a recent cancer scare that he began thinking about the circumstances of his birth .

it was dawn on 6 june , 2004 , and my room in a small seafront hotel at arromanches , normandy , was bathed in pink light .
small knots of early risers had gathered outside to watch the piper as he paced the empty sands .
it was his very personal tribute to those who had fallen here , on the day 60 years earlier when thousands of allied troops had stormed ashore on d-day .
for me , and for bbc colleagues , this was the start of a remarkable and often moving year of remembrance .
a journey through europe from normandy to arnhem and to the closing days of the war in germany .
first contact it was in normandy that i met the actor richard todd , who had parachuted in with his unit to capture a vital bridge . "
one day i felt that i just could n't go on , and two friends picked me up ... and literally dragged me along .
that 's what friends are for , i reckon . "
raf sgt batch batchelder - pow we helped him find the spot where he had landed - his first sight of it since d-day .
looking over the rolling farmland that was his drop zone , he recalled first contacts with the german defenders .
" i realised there was a certain amount of small arms fire ... tracer going all over the area , and i decided to get the hell out of there as quick as i could . "
" i lost friends ..
i 'd never lost friends before .
i think d-day was the making of me ...
i grew up that day .. "
like the british veterans before me , my journey took me across france , belgium , and the netherlands - scene of operation market garden , an ambitious plan to advance rapidly towards the rhine .
tribute to friends sixty years on i watched eight former paratroopers , most in their eighties , jump once more into the arnhem landing zone ; tens of thousands came to acknowledge this tribute to friends who lost their lives .
les lockett , one of the eight , summed up why they had overcome the frailties of age .
" there 's a lot of pride in going up , " he said .
" it 's not courage , it 's pride . "
courage would be shown even as europe celebrated the german surrender .
i met former raf sergeant batch batchelder , one of the ' forgotten pow 's ' - prisoners of war marched east by their captors , sick , exhausted , and without food .
many died at the roadside .
" one day i felt that i just could n't go on , " sergeant batch told me .
" and two friends picked me up , put their hands under my armpits , and literally dragged me along .
that 's what friends are for , i reckon . "
he survived to be reunited with his wife ; he says that this 60th anniversary of ve day is prompting memories of those final days in captivity .
his final comment echoes the feelings of so many other veterans : " coming home is a personal thing , but it does n't preclude me from thinking about all those others ... the men who did n't come home . "

the change means every clamping company has to be licensed and staff must abide by a code of conduct .
failure to get a licence , which requires going on a training course , could attract a £ 5,000 fine or six-month prison sentence .
introduction of the scheme was delayed because too few people had completed a training course by the march deadline .
drop predicted a rise in private clamping firms since wheel clamps were first used in the uk in 1983 meant more and more motorists were affected , said bbc news correspondent tim muffett .
he said drivers were paying up to £ 400 to have their cars released .
not any joe bloggs can go out and put a clamp on their car and demand money with menaces rick ellis , wheel clamper now the setting up of wheel-clamping firms was restricted to those with a licence , a drop in the amount of clamping in private areas such as business parks and housing estates was expected , he said .
speaking in the run-up to the original launch date , wheel clamper rick ellis , of zonehold ltd , said he was looking forward to the new licensing rules .
" hopefully people wo n't think of us as cowboys any more because they will appreciate that we are licensed .
" not any joe bloggs can go out and put a clamp on their car and demand money with menaces , which a lot of people seem to think we do . "
' fleece motorists ' andy drane , of the security industry authority - which manages the private security industry - said the delay was caused by difficulties between trainers and awarding body , edexcel .
the rac foundation has campaigned for 11 years for the introduction of statutory regulations to limit the " excesses " of private clamping companies .
its executive director , edmund king , said many clampers were just out to " fleece the motorist " .
" motorists should not park on private land but often these rogues encourage parking by leaving decoy cars or by hiding signs , " he said .
the legislation to allow the licensing scheme was passed in the security industry bill in 2001 , and the security industry authority set up in april 2003 .
your comments : i was clamped in a delivery area by a busy town centre thoroughfare .
i was away from my car for about 5 minutes ; the clampers were waiting at the site and struck when i was out of site .
when i returned , they pointed out two signs , both were on adjacent walls and some 8 feet off the ground , the font size was too small to be read unless very close .
i did not notice either sign when i parked .
the clampers demanded £ 95 to remove the clamp , which i paid .
the site is owned by an adjacent shop .
i telephoned the owner of the shop twice , on the first occasion he denied any knowledge , but when pressed during my second call , he admitted that he instructed the clamping company and that it was " an easy way to make a bit of extra cash at christmas " -lrb- it was december -rrb- .
i contacted the local authority who said they had received other complaints about the site , but they were powerless to act .
it stinks , i thought about taking the owner to small claims court and to get him some bad publicity , but like many of these things , my anger subsided and i moved on .
mark tutton , warwick , warwickshire come to scotland .
clamping was ruled illegal here several years ago and i think that the same thing should happen in the rest of the uk .
brendan , glasgow the legislation is welcome .
however , if the signs are clearly visible , then the clampers are justified in clamping people parking without permission .
neil small , scotland i was clamped after spending 2 minutes in my local royal mail depot .
the clampers were hiding behind a building and pounced as soon as i entered the door .
as i emerged , they were putting the clamp on but refused to stop .
they were in an unmarked van and i had to pay there and then by credit card top get my car released .
my letter of complaint to the clamping company got no response .
fleecing is the word .
david harper , harrow , middlesex my father was clamped in the early days of clamping .
the car park looked as if it belongs to the hotel we were attending a function at , but unbeknown to use it did n't .
the clamping warning signs were put up while we were in the hotel , and as soon as they had been nailed up they clamped every car there .
dad had a serious heart condition and seldom went out because he found cold wet weather difficult to manage - but that did n't stop the firm leaving him standing in the car park , after midnight , in the rain , refusing to unclamp the car without a hefty fine being paid .
doris , poole england my fiancée and i had our car clamped whilst looking around a flat in high wycombe .
having parked near the estate agent and only spending about 5 minutes in the flat we returned to find the car being lifted onto a lorry to be towed away .
apparently he had fitted the clamps for the correct amount of time and now he had to tow us away .
200 miles from home and car less with just a mobile phone number to find the car .
the police were unable to do anything .
in the end had to meet the " clamper " in a mcdonalds car park outside uxbridge .
he then drove me to a cash point in his truck to take out £ 250 before he would take me to the car .
if was on a dirt track in the middle of nowhere , unlocked and unprotected .
the car had been held to random .
the receipt he gave me had not information other than a po box number and a telephone number with an answer machine on !
this was a horrible experience and i hope that licensing the clampers goes some way to stopping this happening to other people .
needless to say we did not buy the flat , or decide to live in high wycombe !
giles fairhead , high wycombe this will make no difference at all - even the legitimate companies act completely unreasonably and clamping is a way of making money for the companies .
it has nothing to do with improving parking or dealing with those who park illegally .

david harper , harrow , middlesex my father was clamped in the early days of clamping .
the car park looked as if it belongs to the hotel we were attending a function at , but unbeknown to use it did n't .
the clamping warning signs were put up while we were in the hotel , and as soon as they had been nailed up they clamped every car there .
dad had a serious heart condition and seldom went out because he found cold wet weather difficult to manage - but that did n't stop the firm leaving him standing in the car park , after midnight , in the rain , refusing to unclamp the car without a hefty fine being paid .
doris , poole england my fiancée and i had our car clamped whilst looking around a flat in high wycombe .
having parked near the estate agent and only spending about 5 minutes in the flat we returned to find the car being lifted onto a lorry to be towed away .
apparently he had fitted the clamps for the correct amount of time and now he had to tow us away .
200 miles from home and car less with just a mobile phone number to find the car .
the police were unable to do anything .
in the end had to meet the " clamper " in a mcdonalds car park outside uxbridge .
he then drove me to a cash point in his truck to take out £ 250 before he would take me to the car .
if was on a dirt track in the middle of nowhere , unlocked and unprotected .
the car had been held to random .
the receipt he gave me had not information other than a po box number and a telephone number with an answer machine on !
this was a horrible experience and i hope that licensing the clampers goes some way to stopping this happening to other people .
needless to say we did not buy the flat , or decide to live in high wycombe !
giles fairhead , high wycombe this will make no difference at all - even the legitimate companies act completely unreasonably and clamping is a way of making money for the companies .
it has nothing to do with improving parking or dealing with those who park illegally .

your comments : i was clamped in a delivery area by a busy town centre thoroughfare .
i was away from my car for about 5 minutes ; the clampers were waiting at the site and struck when i was out of site .
when i returned , they pointed out two signs , both were on adjacent walls and some 8 feet off the ground , the font size was too small to be read unless very close .
i did not notice either sign when i parked .
the clampers demanded £ 95 to remove the clamp , which i paid .
the site is owned by an adjacent shop .
i telephoned the owner of the shop twice , on the first occasion he denied any knowledge , but when pressed during my second call , he admitted that he instructed the clamping company and that it was " an easy way to make a bit of extra cash at christmas " -lrb- it was december -rrb- .

the clamping warning signs were put up while we were in the hotel , and as soon as they had been nailed up they clamped every car there .

having parked near the estate agent and only spending about 5 minutes in the flat we returned to find the car being lifted onto a lorry to be towed away .

the car had been held to random .
the receipt he gave me had not information other than a po box number and a telephone number with an answer machine on !
this was a horrible experience and i hope that licensing the clampers goes some way to stopping this happening to other people .

but within two years , mr riaz was forced to shut down and seek an alternative living .
" everything is pirated here , " he says .
" from software to audio to video , nothing escapes the pirates ' cutlass . "
indeed , pakistan has risen over the last 25 years to become a global hub of audio and video piracy .
international piracy watchdogs currently rank the country in the world 's top 10 pirate nations .
they say pakistan will continue to climb the piracy charts unless drastic measures are adopted to put an end to illegal copying .
trade sanctions risk in a letter to prime minister shaukat aziz last year , the international federation for phonographic industries -lrb- ifpi -rrb- said illegal replication facilities in pakistan were doubling their copying capacity every 18 months .
the scale of such operations has already reached staggering proportions .
what never ceases to amaze foreign visitors to pakistan is that the country 's big dvd and cd shops are full of perfectly packaged - but pirated - goods .
according to the ifpi , pakistani replication facilities are producing in excess of 230 million copies a year . "
for as long as pakistanis want to watch cheap movies , there will be piracy " khalid jan mohammed given that the country 's local consumption is only about 25 million discs , the ifpi concludes that the rest are being exported across the world .
the organisation estimated in 2003 that pakistani pirates were exporting more than 13 million cds and dvds to 46 countries every month .
since then the figure has gone up , it believes .
global anti-piracy bodies are hoping that the coming into effect of an international agreement called trips -lrb- trade related aspects of intellectual property rights -rrb- on 1 january this year may force a change in the situation .
pakistan is a signatory to trips and risks trade sanctions from western nations if it fails to honour its obligations under the treaty .
government officials point to tighter customs control at airports which they say have led to a decline in air shipments .
but custom officials argue the change may prove to be merely cosmetic - the bulk of the illicit trade is conducted via land or sea routes .
pessimism pakistani investigators name dubai , nepal and india as the three major transit countries for illicit dvds originating from pakistan .
their pessimism is shared by khalid jan mohammed , one of the leading players in pakistan 's cd and dvd business .
pakistan piracy pirate dvd fetches $ 1 in pakistan , $ 10 abroad over 13m pirate copies exported a month about 230m replica discs made every year domestic piracy market worth $ 27m a year annual cost to copyright holders - at least $ 2.7bn ifpi estimated figures sitting in his sparsely furnished office on one of karachi 's busiest roads , mr mohammed denies that his company - sadaf cd - is involved in piracy .
but few would be convinced .
" look , my friend , necessity is the mother of invention , " he says .
" for as long as pakistanis want to watch cheap movies , there will be piracy . "
the international community can go hang , he says .
mr mohammed has been in the business for 22 years and his speech - laced with expletives of all kinds - bears testimony to his street-smart credentials .
his powerful connections in the pakistani administration are almost legendary , which perhaps explains why moving against him and other big players in the business is so hard .
" alcohol was banned over 25 years ago , but you name a brand that is not available in pakistan , " he argues .
just like the alcohol market had influential customers who kept it going , he says , so does the piracy bazaar .
huge profits " western diplomats buy these pirated dvds .
many of them have become my personal friends in the process , " he says .
mr mohammed argues that if the west really wants to stop piracy in pakistan , it needs to convince international distributors to lower their royalty charges .
" pakistanis have become so addicted to cheap entertainment that they will not pay beyond what they already are , " he says .
what they are paying now can perhaps never lure western distributors into treating pakistan as a viable market .
throughout pakistan , the latest movie is available on dvd for just over $ 1 .
the price drops to below $ 1 if the purchase order exceeds 10 .
while these prices may not be good enough to attract the western distributor , there is plenty in it for the pirates .
the pakistani domestic market alone generates some $ 27m every year - and those are just one-tenth of the total bootleg cds and dvds made in pakistan .
the rest go overseas , where dvds fetch on average about $ 10 each , still less than the licensed price .
but even at this low price pirate copy exports from pakistan are costing copyright holders about $ 2.7bn a year .
according to khalid jan mohammed , it is the only business in the country where profit margins can be four to five times the cost .
" you try and stop this , " says mr mohammed .
we will soon be publishing another feature on piracy in pakistan , examining its proliferation inside pakistan and its implications for global trade .

greyhound rescue wales said its volunteers once faced hostility from the racing fraternity but they were now working together with track owners .
the charity staged its annual dog show at the track in swansea on monday .
most of the dogs on show were rescued or rehoused after no longer being fit to race through age or injury .
they do n't want the dogs once they ca n't race - they just want them as a money making commodity name here gwyneth anthony , who has been a rescue volunteer for eight years and has greyhounds and a lurcher , said : " over the last few years there has been a lot more cooperation .
" when we first started to go to the dog tracks we could feel some people starring daggers at us but now they have got to know us and we have got to know them .
" we have built up a wonderful with the track at fforestfach -lrb- swansea -rrb- and at ystrad mynyach where they raise a lot of money for us . "
she said some owners with dogs no longer fit for racing now approach the charity to help get them rehoused and also helped support greyhound rescue financially .
" sadly you still get cases like last hope , " she said .
last hope was found with its ears cut off and barely alive that case sparked national publicity last year when its owner andrew gough was jailed for six-months after the animal had its ears cut off and was left for dead by a footpath on fochriw mountain , near merthyr tydfil .
" they do n't want the dogs once they ca n't race - even if they pups that ca n't go on the track - they just want them as a money making commodity , " said ms anthony .
" we took in about 100 dogs last year but now owners will phone and ask us and if we do n't have the room will look after them until we can take them .
" it is nowhere near as bad as it was years ago .
" people have also come to come to realise greyhounds make wonderful pets .
i have three .
a pup , a greyhound who was injured and could no longer race and a lurcher who was found in a shed in gower .
" he was just fed on scraps and was very thin when we first had him .
we spent hours just talking to him because he was so nervous .
he 's a lot better although is still nervous when people make a fuss of him . "
