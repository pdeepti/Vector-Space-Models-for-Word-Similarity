" we had a very successful first flight and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it , " said claude lelaie , one of the two pilots and the head of the airbus flight division . " there are of course a lot of things to be done , but after this first experience , we now really sense the potential of this magnificent machine , " he said in a statement . the mammoth long-haul airliner , which can carry between 550 and 840 passengers , is due to enter commercial service in mid-2006 , debuting with singapore airlines . tens of thousands of spectators cheered as the a380 double-decker touched down at 2:23 pm -lrb- 1223 gmt -rrb- at toulouse-blagnac airport in southwestern after a successful flight of three hours and 54 minutes .
toulouse is the home of airbus industrie . the airbus prototype took off and landed on runway 32 , dubbed the concorde , from where the world 's only supersonic jetliner made its maiden flight in 1969 . milestone for european unity the applause rippled across europe , as political leaders hailed the achievement as a milestone that proves the might of european unity , a month ahead of a french referendum tipped to reject the proposed european union constitution . french president jacques chirac pointed to the " magnificent result of european industrial cooperation , " and in berlin , deputy economy minister ditmar staffelt called the flight " proof of europe 's high technical capabilities . " in brussels , the european commission called the debut a " success story . "
" the a380 's development shows what europe can do through cooperation and investment in skills , research and technologies , " said industry commissioner guenter verheugen , a german national . the inaugural flight represented a pivotal moment for the european group , which has punched its way to the top of the civil aircraft industry to challenge the boeing 747 's long dominance of the jumbo jet market .
airbus , owned 80 percent by eads 20 percent by bae systems of britain , is banking on the a380 to be the world 's most profitable plane , with a 15-20 percent lower operating cost per seat . security was tightened on the ground and in the air .
two huge parking areas around the airport , enough to accommodate 15,000 cars , were opened and police blocked traffic on nearby roads to allow spectators to approach on foot .
overhead , normal commercial traffic at the airport was suspended only during the 15 minutes before the a380 takeoff , while officials said that airspace was being patrolled to intercept any suspicious planes . a behemoth of the skies it is indeed an aviation giant .
the new airbus , the only twin-deck , four-aisle airliner in the world , can accommodate up to 550 passengers - exceeding the dimensions of everything that has ever landed or taken off from international airports across the globe . the behemoth of the skies came about in response to the steady increase in air passengers .
the german airline , lufthansa has ordered fifteen of the super-birds , scheduled to take to the skies from 2007 .
with his team of 100 people joachim schneider is responsible for the prestigious new fleet . “ we plan to make the a380 our flagship .
we want to be at the head of the pack and that is something that the passenger will ultimately notice , " he said . logistical nightmare however , airport managers between tokyo and los angeles are facing enormous challenges , and not only because they do n't have the runway capacity to deal with the airbus a380 .
they are faced with the logistics of de-icing a 24 meter-high aircraft tail unit , and implementing 90 second evacuation procedures . bildunterschrift : the aviation giant will pose some practical problems on the ground being able to deal with the huge jet will require airport investment to the tune of an estimated 77 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
in germany , munich airport has been technically equipped for the airbus a380 since 2004 , making it the first european airport to be set up for the plane . however , the first german airport to be used for test flights and later for scheduled airline flights will be frankfurt .
fraport services chief wilhelm bender says the airport is well equipped .
“ we were already prepared when terminal 2 came into operation in 1994 .
now we have to make a number of investments in the gate areas and the passenger bridges . ” high hopes for frankfurt along with london and paris , frankfurt hopes to become one of the top three european airports for the a380 .
but it wo n't all be easy sailing for germany ’ s largest airport . local residents who are worried about the noise have already taken legal action aimed at halting any airport extension , which means there is no certainty as to whether the construction of an additional runway planned for 2009 can go ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the skies is not quite big enough for emirates airline huge though it is , the new airbus is still too small to be able to satisfy the expansionist tendencies of the highly profitable arabian airline , emirates , which is calling for planes that can seat up to 800 passengers .
but the dubai-based company has already placed orders for 43 a380 ’ s , making it the number one customer . with an even bigger airbus , low-budget airlines could start operating long-haul flights profitably .
but that in turn is going to require bigger airports on the routes they would fly . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

" the dfb control panel and their chairman , horst hilpert , have decided not to fine robert hoyzer 50,000 euros , " said stenger . " but the panel is still demanding a life ban to ensure he never referees another football match . " berlin official hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches in the biggest scandal in german football since 1971 .
he was subsequently suspended by the dfb and arrested in february before being released on police bail after relinquishing his passport .
the disgraced former official is said to have picked up around 67,000 euros and a widescreen television after working in collaboration with croatian mafia circles in berlin .
it was reported earlier in the year that he not only fixed matches but also worked to corrupt other officials at the behest of his underworld paymasters who reaped huge benefits by betting on the matches hoyzer had been paid to rig . hoyzer is said to have been paid a " finder 's fee " by the croatian mafia , banking a reported 10,000 euros for corrupting a bundesliga referee with 5000 euros - the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . betting practices under the microscope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and dfl are meeting to discuss ways to avoid future betting scandals in the wake of the scandal and the associated concerns centered on betting practices , the dfb and german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- signed a rolling contract with security company ' betradar ' in march to monitor betting in german soccer .
" the dfl and dfb have reached an agreement with betradar and will work alongside bookmakers in the future , " wilfried straub , business leader of dfl , told german newspaper die welt last month . betradar has over a 100 betting offices under its wing and uses extensive contacts to report on strange betting patterns and german soccer authorities hope using their expertise will prevent a repeat of the hoyzer scandal . the dfb and dfl are expected to take further steps to prevent the manipulation of matches and betting scandals on wednesday at an emergency meeting in mainz .
the proposed plan includes a special operating license for bookmakers to take bets on soccer matches which the authorities hope will be in place for the 2006/07 season .
the two authorities are also likely to agree on a ban on players , club officials and match officials from betting on games . emergency federation meeting looks to prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger , vizepraesident des organisationskomitees der fussball-wm 2006 , spricht waehrend einer pressekonferenz in leipzig am dienstag , 27 .

-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- " the dfl has submitted a proposal for a license for bookmakers in germany to which the board of directors of the dfb has given its initial approval , " dfl president werner hackmann said in a statement . also on the agenda is a proposed betting network operated by both the dfb and dfl and an agreement with existing bookmakers which would see betting shops that offer odds on bundesliga games paying royalties for the privilege to the dfl . dfb and dfl look to control betting sector dfb president theo zwanziger has let it be known that he is in favor of all soccer betting coming under the protection of the dfb and dfl after the world cup is over in 2006 . # b # the betting industry in germany generates an estimated three billion euros annually , a large pie that the soccer associations want to get a bigger slice of .
ideally , zwanziger -lrb- photo -rrb- and his fellow soccer bigwigs would like to have that pie and eat it . it is becoming more apparent that both the dfb and dfl have come to some agreement already of taking the betting industry 's soccer sector under a mutual wing although it appears that until now betting monopolist oddset has yet to be consulted .
german sports broadcaster dsf are also preparing to launch its own betting service . federation plan could raise conflict of interests the german government would be glad to see one competitor challenge oddset 's monopoly and the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe is likely to address the possibility of ending the monopoly in the future but there is growing opposition for that competitor to be a combination of the dfb and dfl among established bookmakers . detlef train , head of austrian bookmaker intertops , said that a federation-owned betting service " could not be neutral " with a conflict of interest to large to ignore . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

the disgraced former official is said to have picked up around 67,000 euros and a widescreen television after working in collaboration with croatian mafia circles in berlin .
it was reported earlier in the year that he not only fixed matches but also worked to corrupt other officials at the behest of his underworld paymasters who reaped huge benefits by betting on the matches hoyzer had been paid to rig . hoyzer is said to have been paid a " finder 's fee " by the croatian mafia , banking a reported 10,000 euros for corrupting a bundesliga referee with 5000 euros - the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . betting practices under the microscope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and dfl are meeting to discuss ways to avoid future betting scandals in the wake of the scandal and the associated concerns centered on betting practices , the dfb and german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- signed a rolling contract with security company ' betradar ' in march to monitor betting in german soccer .
" the dfl and dfb have reached an agreement with betradar and will work alongside bookmakers in the future , " wilfried straub , business leader of dfl , told german newspaper die welt last month . betradar has over a 100 betting offices under its wing and uses extensive contacts to report on strange betting patterns and german soccer authorities hope using their expertise will prevent a repeat of the hoyzer scandal . the dfb and dfl are expected to take further steps to prevent the manipulation of matches and betting scandals on wednesday at an emergency meeting in mainz .
the proposed plan includes a special operating license for bookmakers to take bets on soccer matches which the authorities hope will be in place for the 2006/07 season .
the two authorities are also likely to agree on a ban on players , club officials and match officials from betting on games . emergency federation meeting looks to prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger , vizepraesident des organisationskomitees der fussball-wm 2006 , spricht waehrend einer pressekonferenz in leipzig am dienstag , 27 .

ideally , zwanziger -lrb- photo -rrb- and his fellow soccer bigwigs would like to have that pie and eat it . it is becoming more apparent that both the dfb and dfl have come to some agreement already of taking the betting industry 's soccer sector under a mutual wing although it appears that until now betting monopolist oddset has yet to be consulted .
german sports broadcaster dsf are also preparing to launch its own betting service . federation plan could raise conflict of interests the german government would be glad to see one competitor challenge oddset 's monopoly and the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe is likely to address the possibility of ending the monopoly in the future but there is growing opposition for that competitor to be a combination of the dfb and dfl among established bookmakers . detlef train , head of austrian bookmaker intertops , said that a federation-owned betting service " could not be neutral " with a conflict of interest to large to ignore . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades . " if we are having problems because of our liberal drugs policy than somebody should explain to me how these problems are going to go away if we go even further with our liberal policies , " justice minister piet hein donner said during a parliamentary debate on wednesday . during the debate , several parties including the opposition labour party called for the government to regulate cannabis production .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades .

" the dfb control panel and their chairman , horst hilpert , have decided not to fine robert hoyzer 50,000 euros , " said stenger . " but the panel is still demanding a life ban to ensure he never referees another football match . " berlin official hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches in the biggest scandal in german football since 1971 .
he was subsequently suspended by the dfb and arrested in february before being released on police bail after relinquishing his passport .
the disgraced former official is said to have picked up around 67,000 euros and a widescreen television after working in collaboration with croatian mafia circles in berlin .
it was reported earlier in the year that he not only fixed matches but also worked to corrupt other officials at the behest of his underworld paymasters who reaped huge benefits by betting on the matches hoyzer had been paid to rig . hoyzer is said to have been paid a " finder 's fee " by the croatian mafia , banking a reported 10,000 euros for corrupting a bundesliga referee with 5000 euros - the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . betting practices under the microscope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and dfl are meeting to discuss ways to avoid future betting scandals in the wake of the scandal and the associated concerns centered on betting practices , the dfb and german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- signed a rolling contract with security company ' betradar ' in march to monitor betting in german soccer .
" the dfl and dfb have reached an agreement with betradar and will work alongside bookmakers in the future , " wilfried straub , business leader of dfl , told german newspaper die welt last month . betradar has over a 100 betting offices under its wing and uses extensive contacts to report on strange betting patterns and german soccer authorities hope using their expertise will prevent a repeat of the hoyzer scandal . the dfb and dfl are expected to take further steps to prevent the manipulation of matches and betting scandals on wednesday at an emergency meeting in mainz .
the proposed plan includes a special operating license for bookmakers to take bets on soccer matches which the authorities hope will be in place for the 2006/07 season .
the two authorities are also likely to agree on a ban on players , club officials and match officials from betting on games . emergency federation meeting looks to prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger , vizepraesident des organisationskomitees der fussball-wm 2006 , spricht waehrend einer pressekonferenz in leipzig am dienstag , 27 .

ideally , zwanziger -lrb- photo -rrb- and his fellow soccer bigwigs would like to have that pie and eat it . it is becoming more apparent that both the dfb and dfl have come to some agreement already of taking the betting industry 's soccer sector under a mutual wing although it appears that until now betting monopolist oddset has yet to be consulted .
german sports broadcaster dsf are also preparing to launch its own betting service . federation plan could raise conflict of interests the german government would be glad to see one competitor challenge oddset 's monopoly and the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe is likely to address the possibility of ending the monopoly in the future but there is growing opposition for that competitor to be a combination of the dfb and dfl among established bookmakers . detlef train , head of austrian bookmaker intertops , said that a federation-owned betting service " could not be neutral " with a conflict of interest to large to ignore . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

earlier this year the government passed a law to increase both the quality and quantity of child care opportunities . a law is a law , but that 's not enough for germany 's minister for family affairs , renate schmidt . vigorously waving the flag for working mothers , she has launched an information campaign entitled " more care for kids - germany gets family friendly " , in a bid to make parents aware of both the law and the childcare opportunities on offer across the country . in many ways , her battle is against a relatively new tradition . " i think that for at least the last three , if not four decades , our priorities have been wrong .
by " our " , i mean the national , regional and local approaches , " schmidt said . " locally , community halls were three times more important than child care facilities .
regionally , everything was important except investing in children , and nationally we concentrated on material support , forgetting what else families need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , renate schmidt schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- went on to say that the time has come to change tack , and is hopeful that the new campaign is a step in the right direction . " by the year 2010 we want to create at least 230,000 new child care places for children in western germany , and of course maintain the good day care situation in the eastern part of the country .
passing a law is not enough , it has to be followed through to make sure that action is taken , and that is why we started this campaign , " the family affairs minister added . birth rates and the working woman for schmidt it is crucial to provide parents with the chance to combine a professional life with the desire to have children .
sociology professor ute gerhardt , who is also president of the evangelical action community for family issues says there is a close link between working women and birth rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are often frowned upon for putting babies in daycare she cites france and sweden as countries with high numbers of professional women but which also have high birth rates .
renate schmidt would like to encourage fathers to help prompt a shift . " here in germany , we need to finally realise that it is not necessary to have done everything one can do in a lifetime by the time one reaches the age of 40 or 45 .
in other words , that there are career opportunities at the far side of 45 .
and that means that maybe more fathers will decide to take a career break in order to take care of their children themselves .
and of course we want to provide the best possible day care , meaning that children should not only be taken care of in nurseries or kindergartens , but also by nannies , who should have the necessary qualifications , because there have to be very different forms of care . " corporate input there are some signs that the winds of change have already begun to blow , with large employers heeding the call to help their parenting staff . the cell phone company " e plus " , which has some 3,000 employees , is an example of a company committed to helping its employees .
and in this instance , that does not equate to wage increases or company cars , but to the creation of a company kindergarten . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children stand to benefit from days spent among playmates volkswagen is another top german name prepared to help its employees in childcare matters .
but instead of providing support on the premises , vw sponsors existing day car facilities in and around wolfsburg and helps its employees to find places for their children .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business study : men in germany are scared to start families germany -pipe- 27.04.2005 encouraging germans to have more kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare saddled with the lowest birth rate in europe , germany is toddling towards shifting the trend .
earlier this year the government passed a law to increase both the quality and quantity of child care opportunities . a law is a law , but that 's not enough for germany 's minister for family affairs , renate schmidt . vigorously waving the flag for working mothers , she has launched an information campaign entitled " more care for kids - germany gets family friendly " , in a bid to make parents aware of both the law and the childcare opportunities on offer across the country . in many ways , her battle is against a relatively new tradition . " i think that for at least the last three , if not four decades , our priorities have been wrong .
by " our " , i mean the national , regional and local approaches , " schmidt said . " locally , community halls were three times more important than child care facilities .
regionally , everything was important except investing in children , and nationally we concentrated on material support , forgetting what else families need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , renate schmidt schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- went on to say that the time has come to change tack , and is hopeful that the new campaign is a step in the right direction . " by the year 2010 we want to create at least 230,000 new child care places for children in western germany , and of course maintain the good day care situation in the eastern part of the country .
passing a law is not enough , it has to be followed through to make sure that action is taken , and that is why we started this campaign , " the family affairs minister added . birth rates and the working woman for schmidt it is crucial to provide parents with the chance to combine a professional life with the desire to have children .

will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .
as birgit wittermann pointed out : " adding dance classes to the curriculum would tie in perfectly with the need for whole-day schooling .

in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .

in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .
as birgit wittermann pointed out : " adding dance classes to the curriculum would tie in perfectly with the need for whole-day schooling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.04.2005 verdict in yukos trial postponed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky will have to wait until may 16 for his verdict the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow . russian officials delayed the verdict without explanation , but khodorkovsky supporters dismissed speculation of a reprieve for the man once seen as a paragon of fair business play in russia . " it is cynical , it is heartbreaking for the families and it is a clear statement from the russian authorities not only that they are above the law but they are transparently willing to flout due process , " robert amsterdam , an international legal adviser to khodorkvosky , told the afp news agency . no explanation provided the verdict in a trial watched intently worldwide by rights advocates and foreign investors alike was scheduled to be read by judges in a moscow courtroom and its postponement until may 16 was announced in a terse statement taped to the glass door at the main entrance of the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators hold up posters of khodorkovsky with several dozen protesters shouting " shame on the courts ! " outside , defense lawyers entered the courthouse and reemerged soon afterwards , reporting that they had merely been asked to sign a document acknowledging the rescheduling of the verdict hearing . " no one yet knows the reason " for the postponement , said a khodorkovsky defense attorney , igor mikheyev . the delay came two days after president vladimir putin used his annual state of the nation address to describe further development of democracy and the rule of law - including insistence on a genuinely independent judiciary - as russia 's main priority for the years ahead . putin warned khodorkovsky and other " oligarchs " soon after he was elected to his first term in 2000 to stay out of politics , and the trial of the yukos founder has been viewed widely as politically driven kremlin retribution for khodorkovsky 's funding of groups opposed to putin . presidential address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin putin 's -lrb- photo -rrb- speech monday however was characterized by local political experts as a landmark departure from his usual theme of stability and a " strong state , " prompting one top kremlin advisor to speculate tuesday that it could bear directly and favorably on the khodorkovsky verdict . " judging from the text of the address , ensuring the independence of the courts from the executive branch could produce a correct and fair verdict to free two citizens under investigation from tax terrorism , " andrei illarionov , a senior advisor to putin , told interfax news agency . amsterdam said he welcomed illarionov 's comments but did not interpret them as a serious indication that a sentence for khodorkovsky widely expected to be harsh might be diminished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin are due to meet in moscow in may instead , he said , it was a reflection of russian authorities ' efforts to prevent a large cloud from darkening celebrations in moscow on may 9 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii and due to be attended by us president george w. bush and dozens of other leaders . " pushing it past may 9 is just a further demonstration of the actual operation of a political show trial , " amsterdam said .
" they will come up with a reason , some kind of dressed-up reason " for the delay .

" judging from the text of the address , ensuring the independence of the courts from the executive branch could produce a correct and fair verdict to free two citizens under investigation from tax terrorism , " andrei illarionov , a senior advisor to putin , told interfax news agency . amsterdam said he welcomed illarionov 's comments but did not interpret them as a serious indication that a sentence for khodorkovsky widely expected to be harsh might be diminished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin are due to meet in moscow in may instead , he said , it was a reflection of russian authorities ' efforts to prevent a large cloud from darkening celebrations in moscow on may 9 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii and due to be attended by us president george w. bush and dozens of other leaders . " pushing it past may 9 is just a further demonstration of the actual operation of a political show trial , " amsterdam said .
" they will come up with a reason , some kind of dressed-up reason " for the delay .
" but there is in my view no other reason . " interfax news agency , citing an unnamed source , said the verdict was put off because judges had not had enough time in the two weeks since the trial wrapped up to finish writing it .
opposition politicians however scoffed at that explanation . " this is perhaps some kind of intrigue , " irina khakamada , leader of the our choice party , told echo moskvi radio .
" it demonstrates yet again that in our country court rulings derive not from the law but from the will of top politicians . " maximum of ten years khodorkovsky , 41 , and platon lebedev , his 46-year old co-defendant and former top deputy in yukos , have been charged with massive fraud and tax evasion and each face up to 10 years in prison if convicted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant , platon lebedev lebedev was arrested on july 2 , 2003 , followed by khodorkovsky on october 25 that year .
both have been held in prison since then and have appeared throughout their trial inside a cage with metal bars that was placed in the courtroom . speaking to reporters outside the courtroom , khodorkovsky 's father , boris khodorkovsky , said the judges had decided to delay the verdict " due to the massive interest " it had generated among international politicians , investors and journalists .
the trial itself wrapped up on april 11 with khodorkovsky defiantly rejecting the charges against him - as he had throughout the 10 months of court proceedings - as a " farce " and vowing to appeal . as the trial of khodorkovsky has unfolded in the past year , the yukos oil empire that he built has also been effectively dismantled by the russian state .

" we had a very successful first flight and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it , " said claude lelaie , one of the two pilots and the head of the airbus flight division . " there are of course a lot of things to be done , but after this first experience , we now really sense the potential of this magnificent machine , " he said in a statement . the mammoth long-haul airliner , which can carry between 550 and 840 passengers , is due to enter commercial service in mid-2006 , debuting with singapore airlines . tens of thousands of spectators cheered as the a380 double-decker touched down at 2:23 pm -lrb- 1223 gmt -rrb- at toulouse-blagnac airport in southwestern after a successful flight of three hours and 54 minutes .
toulouse is the home of airbus industrie . the airbus prototype took off and landed on runway 32 , dubbed the concorde , from where the world 's only supersonic jetliner made its maiden flight in 1969 . milestone for european unity the applause rippled across europe , as political leaders hailed the achievement as a milestone that proves the might of european unity , a month ahead of a french referendum tipped to reject the proposed european union constitution . french president jacques chirac pointed to the " magnificent result of european industrial cooperation , " and in berlin , deputy economy minister ditmar staffelt called the flight " proof of europe 's high technical capabilities . " in brussels , the european commission called the debut a " success story . "
" the a380 's development shows what europe can do through cooperation and investment in skills , research and technologies , " said industry commissioner guenter verheugen , a german national . the inaugural flight represented a pivotal moment for the european group , which has punched its way to the top of the civil aircraft industry to challenge the boeing 747 's long dominance of the jumbo jet market .

" the dfb control panel and their chairman , horst hilpert , have decided not to fine robert hoyzer 50,000 euros , " said stenger . " but the panel is still demanding a life ban to ensure he never referees another football match . " berlin official hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches in the biggest scandal in german football since 1971 .
he was subsequently suspended by the dfb and arrested in february before being released on police bail after relinquishing his passport .
the disgraced former official is said to have picked up around 67,000 euros and a widescreen television after working in collaboration with croatian mafia circles in berlin .
it was reported earlier in the year that he not only fixed matches but also worked to corrupt other officials at the behest of his underworld paymasters who reaped huge benefits by betting on the matches hoyzer had been paid to rig . hoyzer is said to have been paid a " finder 's fee " by the croatian mafia , banking a reported 10,000 euros for corrupting a bundesliga referee with 5000 euros - the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . betting practices under the microscope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and dfl are meeting to discuss ways to avoid future betting scandals in the wake of the scandal and the associated concerns centered on betting practices , the dfb and german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- signed a rolling contract with security company ' betradar ' in march to monitor betting in german soccer .
" the dfl and dfb have reached an agreement with betradar and will work alongside bookmakers in the future , " wilfried straub , business leader of dfl , told german newspaper die welt last month . betradar has over a 100 betting offices under its wing and uses extensive contacts to report on strange betting patterns and german soccer authorities hope using their expertise will prevent a repeat of the hoyzer scandal . the dfb and dfl are expected to take further steps to prevent the manipulation of matches and betting scandals on wednesday at an emergency meeting in mainz .
the proposed plan includes a special operating license for bookmakers to take bets on soccer matches which the authorities hope will be in place for the 2006/07 season .
the two authorities are also likely to agree on a ban on players , club officials and match officials from betting on games . emergency federation meeting looks to prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger , vizepraesident des organisationskomitees der fussball-wm 2006 , spricht waehrend einer pressekonferenz in leipzig am dienstag , 27 .

-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- " the dfl has submitted a proposal for a license for bookmakers in germany to which the board of directors of the dfb has given its initial approval , " dfl president werner hackmann said in a statement . also on the agenda is a proposed betting network operated by both the dfb and dfl and an agreement with existing bookmakers which would see betting shops that offer odds on bundesliga games paying royalties for the privilege to the dfl . dfb and dfl look to control betting sector dfb president theo zwanziger has let it be known that he is in favor of all soccer betting coming under the protection of the dfb and dfl after the world cup is over in 2006 . # b # the betting industry in germany generates an estimated three billion euros annually , a large pie that the soccer associations want to get a bigger slice of .
ideally , zwanziger -lrb- photo -rrb- and his fellow soccer bigwigs would like to have that pie and eat it . it is becoming more apparent that both the dfb and dfl have come to some agreement already of taking the betting industry 's soccer sector under a mutual wing although it appears that until now betting monopolist oddset has yet to be consulted .
german sports broadcaster dsf are also preparing to launch its own betting service . federation plan could raise conflict of interests the german government would be glad to see one competitor challenge oddset 's monopoly and the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe is likely to address the possibility of ending the monopoly in the future but there is growing opposition for that competitor to be a combination of the dfb and dfl among established bookmakers . detlef train , head of austrian bookmaker intertops , said that a federation-owned betting service " could not be neutral " with a conflict of interest to large to ignore . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.04.2005 boogying between math and spelling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaking a leg beats sitting in class a new project in berlin is aiming to get dance on the school curriculum .
will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .
as birgit wittermann pointed out : " adding dance classes to the curriculum would tie in perfectly with the need for whole-day schooling . " jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany music-literate again numerous studies have shown a strong correlation between music and intellectual development .
so why are german schools giving music education short shrift ?
-lrb- march 10 , 2005 -rrb- germany 's migrant children tip the scales even as health experts warn that german youngsters are getting fatter , obesity levels continue to climb among the country 's migrant children population .

in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .

royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .
as birgit wittermann pointed out : " adding dance classes to the curriculum would tie in perfectly with the need for whole-day schooling .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business study : men in germany are scared to start families germany -pipe- 27.04.2005 encouraging germans to have more kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare saddled with the lowest birth rate in europe , germany is toddling towards shifting the trend .
earlier this year the government passed a law to increase both the quality and quantity of child care opportunities . a law is a law , but that 's not enough for germany 's minister for family affairs , renate schmidt . vigorously waving the flag for working mothers , she has launched an information campaign entitled " more care for kids - germany gets family friendly " , in a bid to make parents aware of both the law and the childcare opportunities on offer across the country . in many ways , her battle is against a relatively new tradition . " i think that for at least the last three , if not four decades , our priorities have been wrong .
by " our " , i mean the national , regional and local approaches , " schmidt said . " locally , community halls were three times more important than child care facilities .
regionally , everything was important except investing in children , and nationally we concentrated on material support , forgetting what else families need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , renate schmidt schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- went on to say that the time has come to change tack , and is hopeful that the new campaign is a step in the right direction . " by the year 2010 we want to create at least 230,000 new child care places for children in western germany , and of course maintain the good day care situation in the eastern part of the country .
passing a law is not enough , it has to be followed through to make sure that action is taken , and that is why we started this campaign , " the family affairs minister added . birth rates and the working woman for schmidt it is crucial to provide parents with the chance to combine a professional life with the desire to have children .
sociology professor ute gerhardt , who is also president of the evangelical action community for family issues says there is a close link between working women and birth rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are often frowned upon for putting babies in daycare she cites france and sweden as countries with high numbers of professional women but which also have high birth rates .
renate schmidt would like to encourage fathers to help prompt a shift . " here in germany , we need to finally realise that it is not necessary to have done everything one can do in a lifetime by the time one reaches the age of 40 or 45 .
in other words , that there are career opportunities at the far side of 45 .
and that means that maybe more fathers will decide to take a career break in order to take care of their children themselves .
and of course we want to provide the best possible day care , meaning that children should not only be taken care of in nurseries or kindergartens , but also by nannies , who should have the necessary qualifications , because there have to be very different forms of care . " corporate input there are some signs that the winds of change have already begun to blow , with large employers heeding the call to help their parenting staff . the cell phone company " e plus " , which has some 3,000 employees , is an example of a company committed to helping its employees .
and in this instance , that does not equate to wage increases or company cars , but to the creation of a company kindergarten . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children stand to benefit from days spent among playmates volkswagen is another top german name prepared to help its employees in childcare matters .
but instead of providing support on the premises , vw sponsors existing day car facilities in and around wolfsburg and helps its employees to find places for their children .
such projects might be small steps , but each one takes the country that bit closer to the ultimate aim of stimulating birth rates . sabine ripperger -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .
dw-world looks at the stories around the issue of germany 's declining birth rate and what it means for the future of the nation .

toulouse is the home of airbus industrie . the airbus prototype took off and landed on runway 32 , dubbed the concorde , from where the world 's only supersonic jetliner made its maiden flight in 1969 . milestone for european unity the applause rippled across europe , as political leaders hailed the achievement as a milestone that proves the might of european unity , a month ahead of a french referendum tipped to reject the proposed european union constitution . french president jacques chirac pointed to the " magnificent result of european industrial cooperation , " and in berlin , deputy economy minister ditmar staffelt called the flight " proof of europe 's high technical capabilities .

" the a380 's development shows what europe can do through cooperation and investment in skills , research and technologies , " said industry commissioner guenter verheugen , a german national . the inaugural flight represented a pivotal moment for the european group , which has punched its way to the top of the civil aircraft industry to challenge the boeing 747 's long dominance of the jumbo jet market .
airbus , owned 80 percent by eads 20 percent by bae systems of britain , is banking on the a380 to be the world 's most profitable plane , with a 15-20 percent lower operating cost per seat . security was tightened on the ground and in the air .

today , this is difficult to assess . " net income in the company 's second fiscal quarter dropped to 781 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- from 1.2 billion euros at the same time last year , when siemens made generous profits following the sale of a stake in former chip unit infineon technologies ag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld siemens problems lie squarely with its telecommunications unit .
although it is the world 's fifth largest hand-set manufacturer , high labor and site costs make it hard for the german giant to compete with fast-expanding , flexible asian producers . reorganization plans after the fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the mobile phone unit , kleinfeld is planning to remove the thorn in siemens side by reorganizing the branch as a separate business . the company 's new helmsman made it clear there were neither plans to sell nor scrap siemens ' loss-making black sheep .
he said he was positive that there is a solution to be found , " a solution which includes a partner or a string of partners . " there is much speculation about the most likely candidates to join forces with siemens .
at the weekend , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that us cell phone manufacturer , motorola inc , is in advanced talks on a possible partnership with the german company .
it said the us company was eager to use such a deal to secure better access to the european market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorola is launching 16 new generation cell phones this year but that particular rumor has surfaced again and again over the past three years , and analysts suggest that with motorola inc 's continental sales already gathering momentum , teaming up with siemens would n't make much sense . the other big name in the rumor mill is taiwanese electronic giant , acer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.04.2005 verdict in yukos trial postponed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky will have to wait until may 16 for his verdict the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow . russian officials delayed the verdict without explanation , but khodorkovsky supporters dismissed speculation of a reprieve for the man once seen as a paragon of fair business play in russia . " it is cynical , it is heartbreaking for the families and it is a clear statement from the russian authorities not only that they are above the law but they are transparently willing to flout due process , " robert amsterdam , an international legal adviser to khodorkvosky , told the afp news agency . no explanation provided the verdict in a trial watched intently worldwide by rights advocates and foreign investors alike was scheduled to be read by judges in a moscow courtroom and its postponement until may 16 was announced in a terse statement taped to the glass door at the main entrance of the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators hold up posters of khodorkovsky with several dozen protesters shouting " shame on the courts !

" it is cynical , it is heartbreaking for the families and it is a clear statement from the russian authorities not only that they are above the law but they are transparently willing to flout due process , " robert amsterdam , an international legal adviser to khodorkvosky , told the afp news agency . no explanation provided the verdict in a trial watched intently worldwide by rights advocates and foreign investors alike was scheduled to be read by judges in a moscow courtroom and its postponement until may 16 was announced in a terse statement taped to the glass door at the main entrance of the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators hold up posters of khodorkovsky with several dozen protesters shouting " shame on the courts ! " outside , defense lawyers entered the courthouse and reemerged soon afterwards , reporting that they had merely been asked to sign a document acknowledging the rescheduling of the verdict hearing . " no one yet knows the reason " for the postponement , said a khodorkovsky defense attorney , igor mikheyev . the delay came two days after president vladimir putin used his annual state of the nation address to describe further development of democracy and the rule of law - including insistence on a genuinely independent judiciary - as russia 's main priority for the years ahead . putin warned khodorkovsky and other " oligarchs " soon after he was elected to his first term in 2000 to stay out of politics , and the trial of the yukos founder has been viewed widely as politically driven kremlin retribution for khodorkovsky 's funding of groups opposed to putin . presidential address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin putin 's -lrb- photo -rrb- speech monday however was characterized by local political experts as a landmark departure from his usual theme of stability and a " strong state , " prompting one top kremlin advisor to speculate tuesday that it could bear directly and favorably on the khodorkovsky verdict . " judging from the text of the address , ensuring the independence of the courts from the executive branch could produce a correct and fair verdict to free two citizens under investigation from tax terrorism , " andrei illarionov , a senior advisor to putin , told interfax news agency . amsterdam said he welcomed illarionov 's comments but did not interpret them as a serious indication that a sentence for khodorkovsky widely expected to be harsh might be diminished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin are due to meet in moscow in may instead , he said , it was a reflection of russian authorities ' efforts to prevent a large cloud from darkening celebrations in moscow on may 9 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii and due to be attended by us president george w. bush and dozens of other leaders . " pushing it past may 9 is just a further demonstration of the actual operation of a political show trial , " amsterdam said .
" they will come up with a reason , some kind of dressed-up reason " for the delay .
" but there is in my view no other reason . " interfax news agency , citing an unnamed source , said the verdict was put off because judges had not had enough time in the two weeks since the trial wrapped up to finish writing it .
opposition politicians however scoffed at that explanation . " this is perhaps some kind of intrigue , " irina khakamada , leader of the our choice party , told echo moskvi radio .
" it demonstrates yet again that in our country court rulings derive not from the law but from the will of top politicians . " maximum of ten years khodorkovsky , 41 , and platon lebedev , his 46-year old co-defendant and former top deputy in yukos , have been charged with massive fraud and tax evasion and each face up to 10 years in prison if convicted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant , platon lebedev lebedev was arrested on july 2 , 2003 , followed by khodorkovsky on october 25 that year .
both have been held in prison since then and have appeared throughout their trial inside a cage with metal bars that was placed in the courtroom . speaking to reporters outside the courtroom , khodorkovsky 's father , boris khodorkovsky , said the judges had decided to delay the verdict " due to the massive interest " it had generated among international politicians , investors and journalists .
the trial itself wrapped up on april 11 with khodorkovsky defiantly rejecting the charges against him - as he had throughout the 10 months of court proceedings - as a " farce " and vowing to appeal . as the trial of khodorkovsky has unfolded in the past year , the yukos oil empire that he built has also been effectively dismantled by the russian state .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades . " if we are having problems because of our liberal drugs policy than somebody should explain to me how these problems are going to go away if we go even further with our liberal policies , " justice minister piet hein donner said during a parliamentary debate on wednesday . during the debate , several parties including the opposition labour party called for the government to regulate cannabis production .
even the parliamentary faction of the governing vvd liberal party called for a legalization of cannabis production within the european union . legal production a lure for german smokers ? even raising the debate to parliamentary level is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany which continues to struggle with the amount of german citizens crossing the border for the sole purpose of getting legally stoned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily has often clashed with donner over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , has urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use .
and while there has been ground given on the subject of joint police patrols along the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking and the possible sale of cannabis to dutch nationals only , there is still conflict over the dutch attitude on its own soil and its consequences . dutch say germans should mind their own but donner argues that the dutch drug policy and the existence of coffee shops offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said at a heated summit with schily in berlin in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 1976 , the netherlands have decriminalized the sale and use of cannabis in so called coffee-shops .
a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .
it is like telling a baker that he can sell bread but is not allowed to buy flour , " maastricht mayor christian democrat gerd leers told afp recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch border towns like maastricht and heerlen receive over a million so-called drugs tourists each year .
these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .

but many are suspicious of his motives ahead of crucial state polls . chairman of germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering triggered the debate last week when he accused international investors of being " capitalist locusts " who chew up companies and spit them out again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " i am criticizing all those who think they can pick whatever they need out of any company , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" and they do it without thinking about the employees and all the people who are affected by their decisions . " public outrage deutsche bank is one example .
there was wide-spread public outrage when the company announced in february it was planning to lay off almost 2,000 employees in germany as part of a strategy to boost earnings , despite record profits last year . according to müntefering , its tactic was " immoral and irresponsible . "
but leading german businessmen argue that they have to ensure that the companies remain competitive in the global arena . dieter hundt , president of the employers ' association retaliated against müntefering 's remarks by warning that the debate was simply counter-productive . " the debate sparked by the spd about the power of business and money will harm germany 's image at home and especially abroad , " he insisted . some left-wing politicians in germany have called for a boycott of the offending companies .
and opinion polls show that they have a lot of public support .
nearly 70 percent of germans polled last week said business had become too powerful . ulterior motives ? but an equal number of people are skeptical about the real motives behind the current debate . germany ’ s most populous state of north rhine-westphalia is set to go to the polls in three weeks .
surveys suggest that the social democrats will lose their grip on power in their former stronghold for the first time in 39 years . the new anti-capitalist debate has to be seen in this context , said political analyst professor jürgen falter . " it ’ s a campaign strategy to help the sdp win the north-rhine-westphalia elections , " he stressed .
" but it 's based on a real problem , which is a social and economic one .
there 's a discrepancy between party rhetoric on one hand and the actions of the government on the other . " the spd-led government in berlin has emphasized that there are no plans to change policy and introduce fresh legislation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.04.2005 boogying between math and spelling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : shaking a leg beats sitting in class a new project in berlin is aiming to get dance on the school curriculum .
will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .

will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades . " if we are having problems because of our liberal drugs policy than somebody should explain to me how these problems are going to go away if we go even further with our liberal policies , " justice minister piet hein donner said during a parliamentary debate on wednesday . during the debate , several parties including the opposition labour party called for the government to regulate cannabis production .
even the parliamentary faction of the governing vvd liberal party called for a legalization of cannabis production within the european union . legal production a lure for german smokers ? even raising the debate to parliamentary level is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany which continues to struggle with the amount of german citizens crossing the border for the sole purpose of getting legally stoned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily has often clashed with donner over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , has urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use .
and while there has been ground given on the subject of joint police patrols along the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking and the possible sale of cannabis to dutch nationals only , there is still conflict over the dutch attitude on its own soil and its consequences . dutch say germans should mind their own but donner argues that the dutch drug policy and the existence of coffee shops offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said at a heated summit with schily in berlin in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 1976 , the netherlands have decriminalized the sale and use of cannabis in so called coffee-shops .
a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .
it is like telling a baker that he can sell bread but is not allowed to buy flour , " maastricht mayor christian democrat gerd leers told afp recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch border towns like maastricht and heerlen receive over a million so-called drugs tourists each year .
these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .
cannabis consumption among people aged 15 to 65 is lower in the netherlands than in france , britain or the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money .

and while there has been ground given on the subject of joint police patrols along the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking and the possible sale of cannabis to dutch nationals only , there is still conflict over the dutch attitude on its own soil and its consequences . dutch say germans should mind their own but donner argues that the dutch drug policy and the existence of coffee shops offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said at a heated summit with schily in berlin in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 1976 , the netherlands have decriminalized the sale and use of cannabis in so called coffee-shops .
a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .
it is like telling a baker that he can sell bread but is not allowed to buy flour , " maastricht mayor christian democrat gerd leers told afp recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch border towns like maastricht and heerlen receive over a million so-called drugs tourists each year .
these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .
cannabis consumption among people aged 15 to 65 is lower in the netherlands than in france , britain or the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money .

will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .

in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .
as birgit wittermann pointed out : " adding dance classes to the curriculum would tie in perfectly with the need for whole-day schooling . " jane paulick , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de making germany music-literate again numerous studies have shown a strong correlation between music and intellectual development .

setting a deadline ernst-rainer schudt said his court was still waiting for new files on the september 11 attacks that the us justice department had promised to provide .
" we may have to think about setting a deadline so we can get some movement on this , " he said . motassadeq is being retried on charges of membership in a terrorist organization and accessory to the murder of some 3000 people for his alleged involvement in the so-called hamburg cell that produced three of the september 11 hijackers .
he was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison on the same charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq awaits his re-trial in a courtroom in the northern german town of hamburg , tuesday aug .

motassadeq , accused of helping to plot the september 11 attacks on the united states , was the first person convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks and was sentenced to 15 years ' jail in 2003 .
but the retrial on conspiracy and terrorism charges is already threatened by disagreements with the united states over evidence from a leading al qaeda figure currently in american custody .
-lrb- ap photo / reuters / christian charisius / pool -rrb- at the time of his conviction , he was the only person to have been found guilty in connection with the attacks on the us .
but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction in march 2004 on the grounds that his trial had not been a fair one because us authorities had failed to provide potentially exculpatory intelligence from alleged members of the al-qaeda extremist network in their custody . one of them was ramzi binalshibh , a key suspect who said that the activities of the hamburg group were not known to motassadeq and that the cell consisted only of himself and three suicide hijackers .
defense lawyers argued that motassadeq could not therefore be guilty . moussaoui pleads guilty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zacarias moussaoui headshot , suspect arrested on immigration charges in minneapolis , police booking photo in a virginia court on friday , moussaoui , a 36-year-old french national of moroccan descent , pleaded guilty to six conspiracy charges linked to the september 11 attacks , including to carry out acts of terrorism , to commit aircraft piracy and to use weapons of mass destruction - all of which are capital offenses . moussaoui is the only person in the us so far charged over september 11 , and the us government has said it will seek the death penalty for him . but he has insisted that he was not to be one of the september 11 hijackers and that he was to take part in a later attack on the white house . in 2001 , he was arrested one month before the attacks in immigration charges . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to cooperate with u.s. on moussaoui trial berlin will provide washington with evidence for the trial of moussaoui , the only person charged in the u.s. for a role in the sept .

today , this is difficult to assess . " net income in the company 's second fiscal quarter dropped to 781 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- from 1.2 billion euros at the same time last year , when siemens made generous profits following the sale of a stake in former chip unit infineon technologies ag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld siemens problems lie squarely with its telecommunications unit .
although it is the world 's fifth largest hand-set manufacturer , high labor and site costs make it hard for the german giant to compete with fast-expanding , flexible asian producers . reorganization plans after the fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the mobile phone unit , kleinfeld is planning to remove the thorn in siemens side by reorganizing the branch as a separate business . the company 's new helmsman made it clear there were neither plans to sell nor scrap siemens ' loss-making black sheep .
he said he was positive that there is a solution to be found , " a solution which includes a partner or a string of partners . " there is much speculation about the most likely candidates to join forces with siemens .
at the weekend , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that us cell phone manufacturer , motorola inc , is in advanced talks on a possible partnership with the german company .
it said the us company was eager to use such a deal to secure better access to the european market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorola is launching 16 new generation cell phones this year but that particular rumor has surfaced again and again over the past three years , and analysts suggest that with motorola inc 's continental sales already gathering momentum , teaming up with siemens would n't make much sense . the other big name in the rumor mill is taiwanese electronic giant , acer .

" the dfb control panel and their chairman , horst hilpert , have decided not to fine robert hoyzer 50,000 euros , " said stenger . " but the panel is still demanding a life ban to ensure he never referees another football match . " berlin official hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches in the biggest scandal in german football since 1971 .
he was subsequently suspended by the dfb and arrested in february before being released on police bail after relinquishing his passport .
the disgraced former official is said to have picked up around 67,000 euros and a widescreen television after working in collaboration with croatian mafia circles in berlin .
it was reported earlier in the year that he not only fixed matches but also worked to corrupt other officials at the behest of his underworld paymasters who reaped huge benefits by betting on the matches hoyzer had been paid to rig . hoyzer is said to have been paid a " finder 's fee " by the croatian mafia , banking a reported 10,000 euros for corrupting a bundesliga referee with 5000 euros - the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . betting practices under the microscope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and dfl are meeting to discuss ways to avoid future betting scandals in the wake of the scandal and the associated concerns centered on betting practices , the dfb and german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- signed a rolling contract with security company ' betradar ' in march to monitor betting in german soccer .
" the dfl and dfb have reached an agreement with betradar and will work alongside bookmakers in the future , " wilfried straub , business leader of dfl , told german newspaper die welt last month . betradar has over a 100 betting offices under its wing and uses extensive contacts to report on strange betting patterns and german soccer authorities hope using their expertise will prevent a repeat of the hoyzer scandal . the dfb and dfl are expected to take further steps to prevent the manipulation of matches and betting scandals on wednesday at an emergency meeting in mainz .
the proposed plan includes a special operating license for bookmakers to take bets on soccer matches which the authorities hope will be in place for the 2006/07 season .
the two authorities are also likely to agree on a ban on players , club officials and match officials from betting on games . emergency federation meeting looks to prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger , vizepraesident des organisationskomitees der fussball-wm 2006 , spricht waehrend einer pressekonferenz in leipzig am dienstag , 27 .

-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- " the dfl has submitted a proposal for a license for bookmakers in germany to which the board of directors of the dfb has given its initial approval , " dfl president werner hackmann said in a statement . also on the agenda is a proposed betting network operated by both the dfb and dfl and an agreement with existing bookmakers which would see betting shops that offer odds on bundesliga games paying royalties for the privilege to the dfl . dfb and dfl look to control betting sector dfb president theo zwanziger has let it be known that he is in favor of all soccer betting coming under the protection of the dfb and dfl after the world cup is over in 2006 . # b # the betting industry in germany generates an estimated three billion euros annually , a large pie that the soccer associations want to get a bigger slice of .
ideally , zwanziger -lrb- photo -rrb- and his fellow soccer bigwigs would like to have that pie and eat it . it is becoming more apparent that both the dfb and dfl have come to some agreement already of taking the betting industry 's soccer sector under a mutual wing although it appears that until now betting monopolist oddset has yet to be consulted .
german sports broadcaster dsf are also preparing to launch its own betting service . federation plan could raise conflict of interests the german government would be glad to see one competitor challenge oddset 's monopoly and the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe is likely to address the possibility of ending the monopoly in the future but there is growing opposition for that competitor to be a combination of the dfb and dfl among established bookmakers . detlef train , head of austrian bookmaker intertops , said that a federation-owned betting service " could not be neutral " with a conflict of interest to large to ignore . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

" but the panel is still demanding a life ban to ensure he never referees another football match . " berlin official hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches in the biggest scandal in german football since 1971 .
he was subsequently suspended by the dfb and arrested in february before being released on police bail after relinquishing his passport .
the disgraced former official is said to have picked up around 67,000 euros and a widescreen television after working in collaboration with croatian mafia circles in berlin .
it was reported earlier in the year that he not only fixed matches but also worked to corrupt other officials at the behest of his underworld paymasters who reaped huge benefits by betting on the matches hoyzer had been paid to rig . hoyzer is said to have been paid a " finder 's fee " by the croatian mafia , banking a reported 10,000 euros for corrupting a bundesliga referee with 5000 euros - the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . betting practices under the microscope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and dfl are meeting to discuss ways to avoid future betting scandals in the wake of the scandal and the associated concerns centered on betting practices , the dfb and german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- signed a rolling contract with security company ' betradar ' in march to monitor betting in german soccer .
" the dfl and dfb have reached an agreement with betradar and will work alongside bookmakers in the future , " wilfried straub , business leader of dfl , told german newspaper die welt last month . betradar has over a 100 betting offices under its wing and uses extensive contacts to report on strange betting patterns and german soccer authorities hope using their expertise will prevent a repeat of the hoyzer scandal . the dfb and dfl are expected to take further steps to prevent the manipulation of matches and betting scandals on wednesday at an emergency meeting in mainz .
the proposed plan includes a special operating license for bookmakers to take bets on soccer matches which the authorities hope will be in place for the 2006/07 season .
the two authorities are also likely to agree on a ban on players , club officials and match officials from betting on games . emergency federation meeting looks to prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger , vizepraesident des organisationskomitees der fussball-wm 2006 , spricht waehrend einer pressekonferenz in leipzig am dienstag , 27 .

-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- " the dfl has submitted a proposal for a license for bookmakers in germany to which the board of directors of the dfb has given its initial approval , " dfl president werner hackmann said in a statement . also on the agenda is a proposed betting network operated by both the dfb and dfl and an agreement with existing bookmakers which would see betting shops that offer odds on bundesliga games paying royalties for the privilege to the dfl . dfb and dfl look to control betting sector dfb president theo zwanziger has let it be known that he is in favor of all soccer betting coming under the protection of the dfb and dfl after the world cup is over in 2006 . # b # the betting industry in germany generates an estimated three billion euros annually , a large pie that the soccer associations want to get a bigger slice of .
ideally , zwanziger -lrb- photo -rrb- and his fellow soccer bigwigs would like to have that pie and eat it . it is becoming more apparent that both the dfb and dfl have come to some agreement already of taking the betting industry 's soccer sector under a mutual wing although it appears that until now betting monopolist oddset has yet to be consulted .
german sports broadcaster dsf are also preparing to launch its own betting service . federation plan could raise conflict of interests the german government would be glad to see one competitor challenge oddset 's monopoly and the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe is likely to address the possibility of ending the monopoly in the future but there is growing opposition for that competitor to be a combination of the dfb and dfl among established bookmakers . detlef train , head of austrian bookmaker intertops , said that a federation-owned betting service " could not be neutral " with a conflict of interest to large to ignore . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

but many are suspicious of his motives ahead of crucial state polls . chairman of germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering triggered the debate last week when he accused international investors of being " capitalist locusts " who chew up companies and spit them out again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " i am criticizing all those who think they can pick whatever they need out of any company , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" and they do it without thinking about the employees and all the people who are affected by their decisions . " public outrage deutsche bank is one example .
there was wide-spread public outrage when the company announced in february it was planning to lay off almost 2,000 employees in germany as part of a strategy to boost earnings , despite record profits last year . according to müntefering , its tactic was " immoral and irresponsible . "
but leading german businessmen argue that they have to ensure that the companies remain competitive in the global arena . dieter hundt , president of the employers ' association retaliated against müntefering 's remarks by warning that the debate was simply counter-productive . " the debate sparked by the spd about the power of business and money will harm germany 's image at home and especially abroad , " he insisted . some left-wing politicians in germany have called for a boycott of the offending companies .
and opinion polls show that they have a lot of public support .
nearly 70 percent of germans polled last week said business had become too powerful . ulterior motives ? but an equal number of people are skeptical about the real motives behind the current debate . germany ’ s most populous state of north rhine-westphalia is set to go to the polls in three weeks .
surveys suggest that the social democrats will lose their grip on power in their former stronghold for the first time in 39 years . the new anti-capitalist debate has to be seen in this context , said political analyst professor jürgen falter . " it ’ s a campaign strategy to help the sdp win the north-rhine-westphalia elections , " he stressed .
" but it 's based on a real problem , which is a social and economic one .
there 's a discrepancy between party rhetoric on one hand and the actions of the government on the other . " the spd-led government in berlin has emphasized that there are no plans to change policy and introduce fresh legislation .

" there are thousands of them , " lemnos deputy prefect thodoris baveas told afp recently .
" just by driving at night you can hit a couple each time , there 's that many . " crops at risk from floppy-eared horde farmers on the island have been campaigning in vain for a solution which would help overcome the usurpers which have destroyed thousands of hectares of wheat and vines according to local officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bugs 's days are numbered landowners have claimed that over 2,000 hectares -lrb- 4,800 acres -rrb- of planted crops have been lost to the bunny scourge that is sweeping the idyllic island and want something done about it before the whole of lemnos is laid to waste by the rodent army . hunting ban prevents lethal force the trouble is , government restrictions on hunting are preventing the farmers from fighting back .
local officials have pleaded for the ban to be lifted and for night-time hunts , which are banned in greece , to be allowed .
the cull would have to take place under cover of darkness as the rabbits stay hidden during daytime .
as yet , there has been no change of law and the rabbit rabble continues to run riot . the hunting solution has also come under fire from the greek branch of the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- which reacted cautiously to the plea , arguing that lifting the ban could encourage attacks on other types of game on the island . trained weasels do n't come cheap enter the weasel squad … or at least this is where they would enter if they were n't just so expensive to hire .
" i 've heard that each one costs about 4,400 euros -lrb- $ 5706 -rrb- , " baveas sighed .
" we would need at least 10 weasels , " he dejectedly added . unconfirmed rumors of shady deals involving less well-trained but equally ruthless austrian mercenary weasels were allegedly circulating in some desperate corners of lemnos . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the great german bunny count rabbits are not normally thought of as being in danger of extinction , but according to german animal conservation experts , the country 's bunny population is seriously at risk .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business study : men in germany are scared to start families germany -pipe- 27.04.2005 encouraging germans to have more kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare saddled with the lowest birth rate in europe , germany is toddling towards shifting the trend .
earlier this year the government passed a law to increase both the quality and quantity of child care opportunities . a law is a law , but that 's not enough for germany 's minister for family affairs , renate schmidt . vigorously waving the flag for working mothers , she has launched an information campaign entitled " more care for kids - germany gets family friendly " , in a bid to make parents aware of both the law and the childcare opportunities on offer across the country . in many ways , her battle is against a relatively new tradition . " i think that for at least the last three , if not four decades , our priorities have been wrong .
by " our " , i mean the national , regional and local approaches , " schmidt said . " locally , community halls were three times more important than child care facilities .
regionally , everything was important except investing in children , and nationally we concentrated on material support , forgetting what else families need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , renate schmidt schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- went on to say that the time has come to change tack , and is hopeful that the new campaign is a step in the right direction . " by the year 2010 we want to create at least 230,000 new child care places for children in western germany , and of course maintain the good day care situation in the eastern part of the country .
passing a law is not enough , it has to be followed through to make sure that action is taken , and that is why we started this campaign , " the family affairs minister added . birth rates and the working woman for schmidt it is crucial to provide parents with the chance to combine a professional life with the desire to have children .
sociology professor ute gerhardt , who is also president of the evangelical action community for family issues says there is a close link between working women and birth rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are often frowned upon for putting babies in daycare she cites france and sweden as countries with high numbers of professional women but which also have high birth rates .
renate schmidt would like to encourage fathers to help prompt a shift . " here in germany , we need to finally realise that it is not necessary to have done everything one can do in a lifetime by the time one reaches the age of 40 or 45 .
in other words , that there are career opportunities at the far side of 45 .
and that means that maybe more fathers will decide to take a career break in order to take care of their children themselves .
and of course we want to provide the best possible day care , meaning that children should not only be taken care of in nurseries or kindergartens , but also by nannies , who should have the necessary qualifications , because there have to be very different forms of care . " corporate input there are some signs that the winds of change have already begun to blow , with large employers heeding the call to help their parenting staff . the cell phone company " e plus " , which has some 3,000 employees , is an example of a company committed to helping its employees .
and in this instance , that does not equate to wage increases or company cars , but to the creation of a company kindergarten . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children stand to benefit from days spent among playmates volkswagen is another top german name prepared to help its employees in childcare matters .
but instead of providing support on the premises , vw sponsors existing day car facilities in and around wolfsburg and helps its employees to find places for their children .
such projects might be small steps , but each one takes the country that bit closer to the ultimate aim of stimulating birth rates . sabine ripperger -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a germany without children ?
germany is waking up to the fact that a demographic revolution is underway .
not only are people living longer , but germans are having fewer babies , meaning the population is both shrinking and ageing .

" it is cynical , it is heartbreaking for the families and it is a clear statement from the russian authorities not only that they are above the law but they are transparently willing to flout due process , " robert amsterdam , an international legal adviser to khodorkvosky , told the afp news agency . no explanation provided the verdict in a trial watched intently worldwide by rights advocates and foreign investors alike was scheduled to be read by judges in a moscow courtroom and its postponement until may 16 was announced in a terse statement taped to the glass door at the main entrance of the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators hold up posters of khodorkovsky with several dozen protesters shouting " shame on the courts ! " outside , defense lawyers entered the courthouse and reemerged soon afterwards , reporting that they had merely been asked to sign a document acknowledging the rescheduling of the verdict hearing . " no one yet knows the reason " for the postponement , said a khodorkovsky defense attorney , igor mikheyev . the delay came two days after president vladimir putin used his annual state of the nation address to describe further development of democracy and the rule of law - including insistence on a genuinely independent judiciary - as russia 's main priority for the years ahead . putin warned khodorkovsky and other " oligarchs " soon after he was elected to his first term in 2000 to stay out of politics , and the trial of the yukos founder has been viewed widely as politically driven kremlin retribution for khodorkovsky 's funding of groups opposed to putin . presidential address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin putin 's -lrb- photo -rrb- speech monday however was characterized by local political experts as a landmark departure from his usual theme of stability and a " strong state , " prompting one top kremlin advisor to speculate tuesday that it could bear directly and favorably on the khodorkovsky verdict . " judging from the text of the address , ensuring the independence of the courts from the executive branch could produce a correct and fair verdict to free two citizens under investigation from tax terrorism , " andrei illarionov , a senior advisor to putin , told interfax news agency . amsterdam said he welcomed illarionov 's comments but did not interpret them as a serious indication that a sentence for khodorkovsky widely expected to be harsh might be diminished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin are due to meet in moscow in may instead , he said , it was a reflection of russian authorities ' efforts to prevent a large cloud from darkening celebrations in moscow on may 9 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii and due to be attended by us president george w. bush and dozens of other leaders . " pushing it past may 9 is just a further demonstration of the actual operation of a political show trial , " amsterdam said .
" they will come up with a reason , some kind of dressed-up reason " for the delay .
" but there is in my view no other reason . " interfax news agency , citing an unnamed source , said the verdict was put off because judges had not had enough time in the two weeks since the trial wrapped up to finish writing it .
opposition politicians however scoffed at that explanation . " this is perhaps some kind of intrigue , " irina khakamada , leader of the our choice party , told echo moskvi radio .
" it demonstrates yet again that in our country court rulings derive not from the law but from the will of top politicians . " maximum of ten years khodorkovsky , 41 , and platon lebedev , his 46-year old co-defendant and former top deputy in yukos , have been charged with massive fraud and tax evasion and each face up to 10 years in prison if convicted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant , platon lebedev lebedev was arrested on july 2 , 2003 , followed by khodorkovsky on october 25 that year .
both have been held in prison since then and have appeared throughout their trial inside a cage with metal bars that was placed in the courtroom . speaking to reporters outside the courtroom , khodorkovsky 's father , boris khodorkovsky , said the judges had decided to delay the verdict " due to the massive interest " it had generated among international politicians , investors and journalists .
the trial itself wrapped up on april 11 with khodorkovsky defiantly rejecting the charges against him - as he had throughout the 10 months of court proceedings - as a " farce " and vowing to appeal . as the trial of khodorkovsky has unfolded in the past year , the yukos oil empire that he built has also been effectively dismantled by the russian state .

" there are thousands of them , " lemnos deputy prefect thodoris baveas told afp recently .
" just by driving at night you can hit a couple each time , there 's that many . " crops at risk from floppy-eared horde farmers on the island have been campaigning in vain for a solution which would help overcome the usurpers which have destroyed thousands of hectares of wheat and vines according to local officials . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bugs 's days are numbered landowners have claimed that over 2,000 hectares -lrb- 4,800 acres -rrb- of planted crops have been lost to the bunny scourge that is sweeping the idyllic island and want something done about it before the whole of lemnos is laid to waste by the rodent army . hunting ban prevents lethal force the trouble is , government restrictions on hunting are preventing the farmers from fighting back .
local officials have pleaded for the ban to be lifted and for night-time hunts , which are banned in greece , to be allowed .
the cull would have to take place under cover of darkness as the rabbits stay hidden during daytime .
as yet , there has been no change of law and the rabbit rabble continues to run riot . the hunting solution has also come under fire from the greek branch of the world wildlife fund for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- which reacted cautiously to the plea , arguing that lifting the ban could encourage attacks on other types of game on the island . trained weasels do n't come cheap enter the weasel squad … or at least this is where they would enter if they were n't just so expensive to hire .
" i 've heard that each one costs about 4,400 euros -lrb- $ 5706 -rrb- , " baveas sighed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.04.2005 verdict in yukos trial postponed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky will have to wait until may 16 for his verdict the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow . russian officials delayed the verdict without explanation , but khodorkovsky supporters dismissed speculation of a reprieve for the man once seen as a paragon of fair business play in russia . " it is cynical , it is heartbreaking for the families and it is a clear statement from the russian authorities not only that they are above the law but they are transparently willing to flout due process , " robert amsterdam , an international legal adviser to khodorkvosky , told the afp news agency . no explanation provided the verdict in a trial watched intently worldwide by rights advocates and foreign investors alike was scheduled to be read by judges in a moscow courtroom and its postponement until may 16 was announced in a terse statement taped to the glass door at the main entrance of the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators hold up posters of khodorkovsky with several dozen protesters shouting " shame on the courts ! " outside , defense lawyers entered the courthouse and reemerged soon afterwards , reporting that they had merely been asked to sign a document acknowledging the rescheduling of the verdict hearing . " no one yet knows the reason " for the postponement , said a khodorkovsky defense attorney , igor mikheyev . the delay came two days after president vladimir putin used his annual state of the nation address to describe further development of democracy and the rule of law - including insistence on a genuinely independent judiciary - as russia 's main priority for the years ahead . putin warned khodorkovsky and other " oligarchs " soon after he was elected to his first term in 2000 to stay out of politics , and the trial of the yukos founder has been viewed widely as politically driven kremlin retribution for khodorkovsky 's funding of groups opposed to putin . presidential address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin putin 's -lrb- photo -rrb- speech monday however was characterized by local political experts as a landmark departure from his usual theme of stability and a " strong state , " prompting one top kremlin advisor to speculate tuesday that it could bear directly and favorably on the khodorkovsky verdict . " judging from the text of the address , ensuring the independence of the courts from the executive branch could produce a correct and fair verdict to free two citizens under investigation from tax terrorism , " andrei illarionov , a senior advisor to putin , told interfax news agency . amsterdam said he welcomed illarionov 's comments but did not interpret them as a serious indication that a sentence for khodorkovsky widely expected to be harsh might be diminished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin are due to meet in moscow in may instead , he said , it was a reflection of russian authorities ' efforts to prevent a large cloud from darkening celebrations in moscow on may 9 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii and due to be attended by us president george w. bush and dozens of other leaders . " pushing it past may 9 is just a further demonstration of the actual operation of a political show trial , " amsterdam said .
" they will come up with a reason , some kind of dressed-up reason " for the delay .
" but there is in my view no other reason . " interfax news agency , citing an unnamed source , said the verdict was put off because judges had not had enough time in the two weeks since the trial wrapped up to finish writing it .
opposition politicians however scoffed at that explanation . " this is perhaps some kind of intrigue , " irina khakamada , leader of the our choice party , told echo moskvi radio .
" it demonstrates yet again that in our country court rulings derive not from the law but from the will of top politicians . " maximum of ten years khodorkovsky , 41 , and platon lebedev , his 46-year old co-defendant and former top deputy in yukos , have been charged with massive fraud and tax evasion and each face up to 10 years in prison if convicted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant , platon lebedev lebedev was arrested on july 2 , 2003 , followed by khodorkovsky on october 25 that year .
both have been held in prison since then and have appeared throughout their trial inside a cage with metal bars that was placed in the courtroom . speaking to reporters outside the courtroom , khodorkovsky 's father , boris khodorkovsky , said the judges had decided to delay the verdict " due to the massive interest " it had generated among international politicians , investors and journalists .
the trial itself wrapped up on april 11 with khodorkovsky defiantly rejecting the charges against him - as he had throughout the 10 months of court proceedings - as a " farce " and vowing to appeal . as the trial of khodorkovsky has unfolded in the past year , the yukos oil empire that he built has also been effectively dismantled by the russian state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.04.2005 verdict in yukos trial postponed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky will have to wait until may 16 for his verdict the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow . russian officials delayed the verdict without explanation , but khodorkovsky supporters dismissed speculation of a reprieve for the man once seen as a paragon of fair business play in russia . " it is cynical , it is heartbreaking for the families and it is a clear statement from the russian authorities not only that they are above the law but they are transparently willing to flout due process , " robert amsterdam , an international legal adviser to khodorkvosky , told the afp news agency . no explanation provided the verdict in a trial watched intently worldwide by rights advocates and foreign investors alike was scheduled to be read by judges in a moscow courtroom and its postponement until may 16 was announced in a terse statement taped to the glass door at the main entrance of the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators hold up posters of khodorkovsky with several dozen protesters shouting " shame on the courts ! " outside , defense lawyers entered the courthouse and reemerged soon afterwards , reporting that they had merely been asked to sign a document acknowledging the rescheduling of the verdict hearing . " no one yet knows the reason " for the postponement , said a khodorkovsky defense attorney , igor mikheyev . the delay came two days after president vladimir putin used his annual state of the nation address to describe further development of democracy and the rule of law - including insistence on a genuinely independent judiciary - as russia 's main priority for the years ahead . putin warned khodorkovsky and other " oligarchs " soon after he was elected to his first term in 2000 to stay out of politics , and the trial of the yukos founder has been viewed widely as politically driven kremlin retribution for khodorkovsky 's funding of groups opposed to putin . presidential address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin putin 's -lrb- photo -rrb- speech monday however was characterized by local political experts as a landmark departure from his usual theme of stability and a " strong state , " prompting one top kremlin advisor to speculate tuesday that it could bear directly and favorably on the khodorkovsky verdict . " judging from the text of the address , ensuring the independence of the courts from the executive branch could produce a correct and fair verdict to free two citizens under investigation from tax terrorism , " andrei illarionov , a senior advisor to putin , told interfax news agency . amsterdam said he welcomed illarionov 's comments but did not interpret them as a serious indication that a sentence for khodorkovsky widely expected to be harsh might be diminished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin are due to meet in moscow in may instead , he said , it was a reflection of russian authorities ' efforts to prevent a large cloud from darkening celebrations in moscow on may 9 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii and due to be attended by us president george w. bush and dozens of other leaders . " pushing it past may 9 is just a further demonstration of the actual operation of a political show trial , " amsterdam said .
" they will come up with a reason , some kind of dressed-up reason " for the delay .
" but there is in my view no other reason . " interfax news agency , citing an unnamed source , said the verdict was put off because judges had not had enough time in the two weeks since the trial wrapped up to finish writing it .
opposition politicians however scoffed at that explanation . " this is perhaps some kind of intrigue , " irina khakamada , leader of the our choice party , told echo moskvi radio .
" it demonstrates yet again that in our country court rulings derive not from the law but from the will of top politicians . " maximum of ten years khodorkovsky , 41 , and platon lebedev , his 46-year old co-defendant and former top deputy in yukos , have been charged with massive fraud and tax evasion and each face up to 10 years in prison if convicted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky , left , and his co-defendant , platon lebedev lebedev was arrested on july 2 , 2003 , followed by khodorkovsky on october 25 that year .
both have been held in prison since then and have appeared throughout their trial inside a cage with metal bars that was placed in the courtroom . speaking to reporters outside the courtroom , khodorkovsky 's father , boris khodorkovsky , said the judges had decided to delay the verdict " due to the massive interest " it had generated among international politicians , investors and journalists .
the trial itself wrapped up on april 11 with khodorkovsky defiantly rejecting the charges against him - as he had throughout the 10 months of court proceedings - as a " farce " and vowing to appeal . as the trial of khodorkovsky has unfolded in the past year , the yukos oil empire that he built has also been effectively dismantled by the russian state .

" we had a very successful first flight and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it , " said claude lelaie , one of the two pilots and the head of the airbus flight division . " there are of course a lot of things to be done , but after this first experience , we now really sense the potential of this magnificent machine , " he said in a statement . the mammoth long-haul airliner , which can carry between 550 and 840 passengers , is due to enter commercial service in mid-2006 , debuting with singapore airlines . tens of thousands of spectators cheered as the a380 double-decker touched down at 2:23 pm -lrb- 1223 gmt -rrb- at toulouse-blagnac airport in southwestern after a successful flight of three hours and 54 minutes .
toulouse is the home of airbus industrie . the airbus prototype took off and landed on runway 32 , dubbed the concorde , from where the world 's only supersonic jetliner made its maiden flight in 1969 . milestone for european unity the applause rippled across europe , as political leaders hailed the achievement as a milestone that proves the might of european unity , a month ahead of a french referendum tipped to reject the proposed european union constitution . french president jacques chirac pointed to the " magnificent result of european industrial cooperation , " and in berlin , deputy economy minister ditmar staffelt called the flight " proof of europe 's high technical capabilities . " in brussels , the european commission called the debut a " success story . "
" the a380 's development shows what europe can do through cooperation and investment in skills , research and technologies , " said industry commissioner guenter verheugen , a german national . the inaugural flight represented a pivotal moment for the european group , which has punched its way to the top of the civil aircraft industry to challenge the boeing 747 's long dominance of the jumbo jet market .
airbus , owned 80 percent by eads 20 percent by bae systems of britain , is banking on the a380 to be the world 's most profitable plane , with a 15-20 percent lower operating cost per seat . security was tightened on the ground and in the air .
two huge parking areas around the airport , enough to accommodate 15,000 cars , were opened and police blocked traffic on nearby roads to allow spectators to approach on foot .
overhead , normal commercial traffic at the airport was suspended only during the 15 minutes before the a380 takeoff , while officials said that airspace was being patrolled to intercept any suspicious planes . a behemoth of the skies it is indeed an aviation giant .
the new airbus , the only twin-deck , four-aisle airliner in the world , can accommodate up to 550 passengers - exceeding the dimensions of everything that has ever landed or taken off from international airports across the globe . the behemoth of the skies came about in response to the steady increase in air passengers .
the german airline , lufthansa has ordered fifteen of the super-birds , scheduled to take to the skies from 2007 .
with his team of 100 people joachim schneider is responsible for the prestigious new fleet . “ we plan to make the a380 our flagship .
we want to be at the head of the pack and that is something that the passenger will ultimately notice , " he said . logistical nightmare however , airport managers between tokyo and los angeles are facing enormous challenges , and not only because they do n't have the runway capacity to deal with the airbus a380 .
they are faced with the logistics of de-icing a 24 meter-high aircraft tail unit , and implementing 90 second evacuation procedures . bildunterschrift : the aviation giant will pose some practical problems on the ground being able to deal with the huge jet will require airport investment to the tune of an estimated 77 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
in germany , munich airport has been technically equipped for the airbus a380 since 2004 , making it the first european airport to be set up for the plane . however , the first german airport to be used for test flights and later for scheduled airline flights will be frankfurt .
fraport services chief wilhelm bender says the airport is well equipped .
“ we were already prepared when terminal 2 came into operation in 1994 .
now we have to make a number of investments in the gate areas and the passenger bridges . ” high hopes for frankfurt along with london and paris , frankfurt hopes to become one of the top three european airports for the a380 .
but it wo n't all be easy sailing for germany ’ s largest airport . local residents who are worried about the noise have already taken legal action aimed at halting any airport extension , which means there is no certainty as to whether the construction of an additional runway planned for 2009 can go ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the skies is not quite big enough for emirates airline huge though it is , the new airbus is still too small to be able to satisfy the expansionist tendencies of the highly profitable arabian airline , emirates , which is calling for planes that can seat up to 800 passengers .
but the dubai-based company has already placed orders for 43 a380 ’ s , making it the number one customer . with an even bigger airbus , low-budget airlines could start operating long-haul flights profitably .
but that in turn is going to require bigger airports on the routes they would fly . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

airbus , owned 80 percent by eads 20 percent by bae systems of britain , is banking on the a380 to be the world 's most profitable plane , with a 15-20 percent lower operating cost per seat . security was tightened on the ground and in the air .
two huge parking areas around the airport , enough to accommodate 15,000 cars , were opened and police blocked traffic on nearby roads to allow spectators to approach on foot .
overhead , normal commercial traffic at the airport was suspended only during the 15 minutes before the a380 takeoff , while officials said that airspace was being patrolled to intercept any suspicious planes . a behemoth of the skies it is indeed an aviation giant .
the new airbus , the only twin-deck , four-aisle airliner in the world , can accommodate up to 550 passengers - exceeding the dimensions of everything that has ever landed or taken off from international airports across the globe . the behemoth of the skies came about in response to the steady increase in air passengers .
the german airline , lufthansa has ordered fifteen of the super-birds , scheduled to take to the skies from 2007 .
with his team of 100 people joachim schneider is responsible for the prestigious new fleet . “ we plan to make the a380 our flagship .
we want to be at the head of the pack and that is something that the passenger will ultimately notice , " he said . logistical nightmare however , airport managers between tokyo and los angeles are facing enormous challenges , and not only because they do n't have the runway capacity to deal with the airbus a380 .
they are faced with the logistics of de-icing a 24 meter-high aircraft tail unit , and implementing 90 second evacuation procedures . bildunterschrift : the aviation giant will pose some practical problems on the ground being able to deal with the huge jet will require airport investment to the tune of an estimated 77 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
in germany , munich airport has been technically equipped for the airbus a380 since 2004 , making it the first european airport to be set up for the plane . however , the first german airport to be used for test flights and later for scheduled airline flights will be frankfurt .
fraport services chief wilhelm bender says the airport is well equipped .
“ we were already prepared when terminal 2 came into operation in 1994 .
now we have to make a number of investments in the gate areas and the passenger bridges . ” high hopes for frankfurt along with london and paris , frankfurt hopes to become one of the top three european airports for the a380 .
but it wo n't all be easy sailing for germany ’ s largest airport . local residents who are worried about the noise have already taken legal action aimed at halting any airport extension , which means there is no certainty as to whether the construction of an additional runway planned for 2009 can go ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the skies is not quite big enough for emirates airline huge though it is , the new airbus is still too small to be able to satisfy the expansionist tendencies of the highly profitable arabian airline , emirates , which is calling for planes that can seat up to 800 passengers .
but the dubai-based company has already placed orders for 43 a380 ’ s , making it the number one customer . with an even bigger airbus , low-budget airlines could start operating long-haul flights profitably .
but that in turn is going to require bigger airports on the routes they would fly . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades . " if we are having problems because of our liberal drugs policy than somebody should explain to me how these problems are going to go away if we go even further with our liberal policies , " justice minister piet hein donner said during a parliamentary debate on wednesday . during the debate , several parties including the opposition labour party called for the government to regulate cannabis production .
even the parliamentary faction of the governing vvd liberal party called for a legalization of cannabis production within the european union . legal production a lure for german smokers ? even raising the debate to parliamentary level is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany which continues to struggle with the amount of german citizens crossing the border for the sole purpose of getting legally stoned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily has often clashed with donner over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , has urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use .
and while there has been ground given on the subject of joint police patrols along the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking and the possible sale of cannabis to dutch nationals only , there is still conflict over the dutch attitude on its own soil and its consequences . dutch say germans should mind their own but donner argues that the dutch drug policy and the existence of coffee shops offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said at a heated summit with schily in berlin in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 1976 , the netherlands have decriminalized the sale and use of cannabis in so called coffee-shops .
a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .
it is like telling a baker that he can sell bread but is not allowed to buy flour , " maastricht mayor christian democrat gerd leers told afp recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch border towns like maastricht and heerlen receive over a million so-called drugs tourists each year .
these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades . " if we are having problems because of our liberal drugs policy than somebody should explain to me how these problems are going to go away if we go even further with our liberal policies , " justice minister piet hein donner said during a parliamentary debate on wednesday . during the debate , several parties including the opposition labour party called for the government to regulate cannabis production .
even the parliamentary faction of the governing vvd liberal party called for a legalization of cannabis production within the european union . legal production a lure for german smokers ? even raising the debate to parliamentary level is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany which continues to struggle with the amount of german citizens crossing the border for the sole purpose of getting legally stoned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily has often clashed with donner over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , has urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use .
and while there has been ground given on the subject of joint police patrols along the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking and the possible sale of cannabis to dutch nationals only , there is still conflict over the dutch attitude on its own soil and its consequences . dutch say germans should mind their own but donner argues that the dutch drug policy and the existence of coffee shops offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said at a heated summit with schily in berlin in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 1976 , the netherlands have decriminalized the sale and use of cannabis in so called coffee-shops .
a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .
it is like telling a baker that he can sell bread but is not allowed to buy flour , " maastricht mayor christian democrat gerd leers told afp recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch border towns like maastricht and heerlen receive over a million so-called drugs tourists each year .
these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .

" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .

with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .
as birgit wittermann pointed out : " adding dance classes to the curriculum would tie in perfectly with the need for whole-day schooling .

will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades . " if we are having problems because of our liberal drugs policy than somebody should explain to me how these problems are going to go away if we go even further with our liberal policies , " justice minister piet hein donner said during a parliamentary debate on wednesday . during the debate , several parties including the opposition labour party called for the government to regulate cannabis production .
even the parliamentary faction of the governing vvd liberal party called for a legalization of cannabis production within the european union . legal production a lure for german smokers ? even raising the debate to parliamentary level is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany which continues to struggle with the amount of german citizens crossing the border for the sole purpose of getting legally stoned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily has often clashed with donner over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , has urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use .
and while there has been ground given on the subject of joint police patrols along the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking and the possible sale of cannabis to dutch nationals only , there is still conflict over the dutch attitude on its own soil and its consequences . dutch say germans should mind their own but donner argues that the dutch drug policy and the existence of coffee shops offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said at a heated summit with schily in berlin in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 1976 , the netherlands have decriminalized the sale and use of cannabis in so called coffee-shops .
a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .
it is like telling a baker that he can sell bread but is not allowed to buy flour , " maastricht mayor christian democrat gerd leers told afp recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch border towns like maastricht and heerlen receive over a million so-called drugs tourists each year .
these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .

work-life balance gets boost in germany the dumbing down of germany gerd 's family policy gets down to business study : men in germany are scared to start families germany -pipe- 27.04.2005 encouraging germans to have more kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare saddled with the lowest birth rate in europe , germany is toddling towards shifting the trend .
earlier this year the government passed a law to increase both the quality and quantity of child care opportunities . a law is a law , but that 's not enough for germany 's minister for family affairs , renate schmidt . vigorously waving the flag for working mothers , she has launched an information campaign entitled " more care for kids - germany gets family friendly " , in a bid to make parents aware of both the law and the childcare opportunities on offer across the country . in many ways , her battle is against a relatively new tradition . " i think that for at least the last three , if not four decades , our priorities have been wrong .
by " our " , i mean the national , regional and local approaches , " schmidt said . " locally , community halls were three times more important than child care facilities .
regionally , everything was important except investing in children , and nationally we concentrated on material support , forgetting what else families need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , renate schmidt schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- went on to say that the time has come to change tack , and is hopeful that the new campaign is a step in the right direction . " by the year 2010 we want to create at least 230,000 new child care places for children in western germany , and of course maintain the good day care situation in the eastern part of the country .
passing a law is not enough , it has to be followed through to make sure that action is taken , and that is why we started this campaign , " the family affairs minister added . birth rates and the working woman for schmidt it is crucial to provide parents with the chance to combine a professional life with the desire to have children .
sociology professor ute gerhardt , who is also president of the evangelical action community for family issues says there is a close link between working women and birth rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are often frowned upon for putting babies in daycare she cites france and sweden as countries with high numbers of professional women but which also have high birth rates .
renate schmidt would like to encourage fathers to help prompt a shift . " here in germany , we need to finally realise that it is not necessary to have done everything one can do in a lifetime by the time one reaches the age of 40 or 45 .
in other words , that there are career opportunities at the far side of 45 .
and that means that maybe more fathers will decide to take a career break in order to take care of their children themselves .
and of course we want to provide the best possible day care , meaning that children should not only be taken care of in nurseries or kindergartens , but also by nannies , who should have the necessary qualifications , because there have to be very different forms of care . " corporate input there are some signs that the winds of change have already begun to blow , with large employers heeding the call to help their parenting staff . the cell phone company " e plus " , which has some 3,000 employees , is an example of a company committed to helping its employees .

" we had a very successful first flight and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it , " said claude lelaie , one of the two pilots and the head of the airbus flight division . " there are of course a lot of things to be done , but after this first experience , we now really sense the potential of this magnificent machine , " he said in a statement . the mammoth long-haul airliner , which can carry between 550 and 840 passengers , is due to enter commercial service in mid-2006 , debuting with singapore airlines . tens of thousands of spectators cheered as the a380 double-decker touched down at 2:23 pm -lrb- 1223 gmt -rrb- at toulouse-blagnac airport in southwestern after a successful flight of three hours and 54 minutes .
toulouse is the home of airbus industrie . the airbus prototype took off and landed on runway 32 , dubbed the concorde , from where the world 's only supersonic jetliner made its maiden flight in 1969 . milestone for european unity the applause rippled across europe , as political leaders hailed the achievement as a milestone that proves the might of european unity , a month ahead of a french referendum tipped to reject the proposed european union constitution . french president jacques chirac pointed to the " magnificent result of european industrial cooperation , " and in berlin , deputy economy minister ditmar staffelt called the flight " proof of europe 's high technical capabilities . " in brussels , the european commission called the debut a " success story . "
" the a380 's development shows what europe can do through cooperation and investment in skills , research and technologies , " said industry commissioner guenter verheugen , a german national . the inaugural flight represented a pivotal moment for the european group , which has punched its way to the top of the civil aircraft industry to challenge the boeing 747 's long dominance of the jumbo jet market .
airbus , owned 80 percent by eads 20 percent by bae systems of britain , is banking on the a380 to be the world 's most profitable plane , with a 15-20 percent lower operating cost per seat . security was tightened on the ground and in the air .
two huge parking areas around the airport , enough to accommodate 15,000 cars , were opened and police blocked traffic on nearby roads to allow spectators to approach on foot .

setting a deadline ernst-rainer schudt said his court was still waiting for new files on the september 11 attacks that the us justice department had promised to provide .
" we may have to think about setting a deadline so we can get some movement on this , " he said . motassadeq is being retried on charges of membership in a terrorist organization and accessory to the murder of some 3000 people for his alleged involvement in the so-called hamburg cell that produced three of the september 11 hijackers .
he was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison on the same charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq awaits his re-trial in a courtroom in the northern german town of hamburg , tuesday aug .

motassadeq , accused of helping to plot the september 11 attacks on the united states , was the first person convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks and was sentenced to 15 years ' jail in 2003 .

setting a deadline ernst-rainer schudt said his court was still waiting for new files on the september 11 attacks that the us justice department had promised to provide .
" we may have to think about setting a deadline so we can get some movement on this , " he said . motassadeq is being retried on charges of membership in a terrorist organization and accessory to the murder of some 3000 people for his alleged involvement in the so-called hamburg cell that produced three of the september 11 hijackers .
he was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison on the same charges .

motassadeq , accused of helping to plot the september 11 attacks on the united states , was the first person convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks and was sentenced to 15 years ' jail in 2003 .
but the retrial on conspiracy and terrorism charges is already threatened by disagreements with the united states over evidence from a leading al qaeda figure currently in american custody .
-lrb- ap photo / reuters / christian charisius / pool -rrb- at the time of his conviction , he was the only person to have been found guilty in connection with the attacks on the us .
but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction in march 2004 on the grounds that his trial had not been a fair one because us authorities had failed to provide potentially exculpatory intelligence from alleged members of the al-qaeda extremist network in their custody . one of them was ramzi binalshibh , a key suspect who said that the activities of the hamburg group were not known to motassadeq and that the cell consisted only of himself and three suicide hijackers .
defense lawyers argued that motassadeq could not therefore be guilty . moussaoui pleads guilty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zacarias moussaoui headshot , suspect arrested on immigration charges in minneapolis , police booking photo in a virginia court on friday , moussaoui , a 36-year-old french national of moroccan descent , pleaded guilty to six conspiracy charges linked to the september 11 attacks , including to carry out acts of terrorism , to commit aircraft piracy and to use weapons of mass destruction - all of which are capital offenses . moussaoui is the only person in the us so far charged over september 11 , and the us government has said it will seek the death penalty for him . but he has insisted that he was not to be one of the september 11 hijackers and that he was to take part in a later attack on the white house . in 2001 , he was arrested one month before the attacks in immigration charges . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to cooperate with u.s. on moussaoui trial berlin will provide washington with evidence for the trial of moussaoui , the only person charged in the u.s. for a role in the sept .

but many are suspicious of his motives ahead of crucial state polls . chairman of germany 's ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , franz müntefering triggered the debate last week when he accused international investors of being " capitalist locusts " who chew up companies and spit them out again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz müntefering " i am criticizing all those who think they can pick whatever they need out of any company , " müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- said .
" and they do it without thinking about the employees and all the people who are affected by their decisions . " public outrage deutsche bank is one example .
there was wide-spread public outrage when the company announced in february it was planning to lay off almost 2,000 employees in germany as part of a strategy to boost earnings , despite record profits last year . according to müntefering , its tactic was " immoral and irresponsible . "
but leading german businessmen argue that they have to ensure that the companies remain competitive in the global arena . dieter hundt , president of the employers ' association retaliated against müntefering 's remarks by warning that the debate was simply counter-productive . " the debate sparked by the spd about the power of business and money will harm germany 's image at home and especially abroad , " he insisted . some left-wing politicians in germany have called for a boycott of the offending companies .
and opinion polls show that they have a lot of public support .
nearly 70 percent of germans polled last week said business had become too powerful . ulterior motives ? but an equal number of people are skeptical about the real motives behind the current debate . germany ’ s most populous state of north rhine-westphalia is set to go to the polls in three weeks .
surveys suggest that the social democrats will lose their grip on power in their former stronghold for the first time in 39 years . the new anti-capitalist debate has to be seen in this context , said political analyst professor jürgen falter . " it ’ s a campaign strategy to help the sdp win the north-rhine-westphalia elections , " he stressed .
" but it 's based on a real problem , which is a social and economic one .
there 's a discrepancy between party rhetoric on one hand and the actions of the government on the other . " the spd-led government in berlin has emphasized that there are no plans to change policy and introduce fresh legislation .
they have vowed to push ahead with their controversial social reforms - even though they are angering many of the most loyal voters . vera möller-holtkamp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spd loses state election , keeps power german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s ruling social democrats look set to cling on to power in the northern state of schleswig-holstein – despite sunday ‘ s drubbing at a regional election there .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades . " if we are having problems because of our liberal drugs policy than somebody should explain to me how these problems are going to go away if we go even further with our liberal policies , " justice minister piet hein donner said during a parliamentary debate on wednesday . during the debate , several parties including the opposition labour party called for the government to regulate cannabis production .
even the parliamentary faction of the governing vvd liberal party called for a legalization of cannabis production within the european union . legal production a lure for german smokers ? even raising the debate to parliamentary level is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany which continues to struggle with the amount of german citizens crossing the border for the sole purpose of getting legally stoned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily has often clashed with donner over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , has urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use .
and while there has been ground given on the subject of joint police patrols along the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking and the possible sale of cannabis to dutch nationals only , there is still conflict over the dutch attitude on its own soil and its consequences . dutch say germans should mind their own but donner argues that the dutch drug policy and the existence of coffee shops offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said at a heated summit with schily in berlin in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 1976 , the netherlands have decriminalized the sale and use of cannabis in so called coffee-shops .
a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .
it is like telling a baker that he can sell bread but is not allowed to buy flour , " maastricht mayor christian democrat gerd leers told afp recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch border towns like maastricht and heerlen receive over a million so-called drugs tourists each year .
these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .

today , this is difficult to assess . " net income in the company 's second fiscal quarter dropped to 781 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- from 1.2 billion euros at the same time last year , when siemens made generous profits following the sale of a stake in former chip unit infineon technologies ag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld siemens problems lie squarely with its telecommunications unit .
although it is the world 's fifth largest hand-set manufacturer , high labor and site costs make it hard for the german giant to compete with fast-expanding , flexible asian producers . reorganization plans after the fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the mobile phone unit , kleinfeld is planning to remove the thorn in siemens side by reorganizing the branch as a separate business . the company 's new helmsman made it clear there were neither plans to sell nor scrap siemens ' loss-making black sheep .
he said he was positive that there is a solution to be found , " a solution which includes a partner or a string of partners . " there is much speculation about the most likely candidates to join forces with siemens .
at the weekend , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that us cell phone manufacturer , motorola inc , is in advanced talks on a possible partnership with the german company .
it said the us company was eager to use such a deal to secure better access to the european market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorola is launching 16 new generation cell phones this year but that particular rumor has surfaced again and again over the past three years , and analysts suggest that with motorola inc 's continental sales already gathering momentum , teaming up with siemens would n't make much sense . the other big name in the rumor mill is taiwanese electronic giant , acer .
on sunday , the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper said that the two companies are currently in talks , but an acer spokesperson said on monday that there had not been any contact between them . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the age of cellulus interruptus for 22 percent of germans , it seems it does n't matter how hot and heavy the sex is , when the mobile phone rings , they 're answering it - even in the middle of the act .

will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .
as birgit wittermann pointed out : " adding dance classes to the curriculum would tie in perfectly with the need for whole-day schooling .

but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .

in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.04.2005 verdict in yukos trial postponed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky will have to wait until may 16 for his verdict the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow . russian officials delayed the verdict without explanation , but khodorkovsky supporters dismissed speculation of a reprieve for the man once seen as a paragon of fair business play in russia . " it is cynical , it is heartbreaking for the families and it is a clear statement from the russian authorities not only that they are above the law but they are transparently willing to flout due process , " robert amsterdam , an international legal adviser to khodorkvosky , told the afp news agency . no explanation provided the verdict in a trial watched intently worldwide by rights advocates and foreign investors alike was scheduled to be read by judges in a moscow courtroom and its postponement until may 16 was announced in a terse statement taped to the glass door at the main entrance of the building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators hold up posters of khodorkovsky with several dozen protesters shouting " shame on the courts ! " outside , defense lawyers entered the courthouse and reemerged soon afterwards , reporting that they had merely been asked to sign a document acknowledging the rescheduling of the verdict hearing . " no one yet knows the reason " for the postponement , said a khodorkovsky defense attorney , igor mikheyev . the delay came two days after president vladimir putin used his annual state of the nation address to describe further development of democracy and the rule of law - including insistence on a genuinely independent judiciary - as russia 's main priority for the years ahead . putin warned khodorkovsky and other " oligarchs " soon after he was elected to his first term in 2000 to stay out of politics , and the trial of the yukos founder has been viewed widely as politically driven kremlin retribution for khodorkovsky 's funding of groups opposed to putin . presidential address bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin putin 's -lrb- photo -rrb- speech monday however was characterized by local political experts as a landmark departure from his usual theme of stability and a " strong state , " prompting one top kremlin advisor to speculate tuesday that it could bear directly and favorably on the khodorkovsky verdict . " judging from the text of the address , ensuring the independence of the courts from the executive branch could produce a correct and fair verdict to free two citizens under investigation from tax terrorism , " andrei illarionov , a senior advisor to putin , told interfax news agency . amsterdam said he welcomed illarionov 's comments but did not interpret them as a serious indication that a sentence for khodorkovsky widely expected to be harsh might be diminished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin are due to meet in moscow in may instead , he said , it was a reflection of russian authorities ' efforts to prevent a large cloud from darkening celebrations in moscow on may 9 commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii and due to be attended by us president george w. bush and dozens of other leaders . " pushing it past may 9 is just a further demonstration of the actual operation of a political show trial , " amsterdam said .
" they will come up with a reason , some kind of dressed-up reason " for the delay .
" but there is in my view no other reason . " interfax news agency , citing an unnamed source , said the verdict was put off because judges had not had enough time in the two weeks since the trial wrapped up to finish writing it .

setting a deadline ernst-rainer schudt said his court was still waiting for new files on the september 11 attacks that the us justice department had promised to provide .
" we may have to think about setting a deadline so we can get some movement on this , " he said . motassadeq is being retried on charges of membership in a terrorist organization and accessory to the murder of some 3000 people for his alleged involvement in the so-called hamburg cell that produced three of the september 11 hijackers .
he was sentenced in february 2003 to 15 years in prison on the same charges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan mounir el motassadeq awaits his re-trial in a courtroom in the northern german town of hamburg , tuesday aug .
10 , 2004 .
motassadeq , accused of helping to plot the september 11 attacks on the united states , was the first person convicted in connection with the 2001 attacks and was sentenced to 15 years ' jail in 2003 .
but the retrial on conspiracy and terrorism charges is already threatened by disagreements with the united states over evidence from a leading al qaeda figure currently in american custody .
-lrb- ap photo / reuters / christian charisius / pool -rrb- at the time of his conviction , he was the only person to have been found guilty in connection with the attacks on the us .
but a federal tribunal overturned the conviction in march 2004 on the grounds that his trial had not been a fair one because us authorities had failed to provide potentially exculpatory intelligence from alleged members of the al-qaeda extremist network in their custody . one of them was ramzi binalshibh , a key suspect who said that the activities of the hamburg group were not known to motassadeq and that the cell consisted only of himself and three suicide hijackers .
defense lawyers argued that motassadeq could not therefore be guilty . moussaoui pleads guilty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zacarias moussaoui headshot , suspect arrested on immigration charges in minneapolis , police booking photo in a virginia court on friday , moussaoui , a 36-year-old french national of moroccan descent , pleaded guilty to six conspiracy charges linked to the september 11 attacks , including to carry out acts of terrorism , to commit aircraft piracy and to use weapons of mass destruction - all of which are capital offenses . moussaoui is the only person in the us so far charged over september 11 , and the us government has said it will seek the death penalty for him . but he has insisted that he was not to be one of the september 11 hijackers and that he was to take part in a later attack on the white house . in 2001 , he was arrested one month before the attacks in immigration charges . afp / dw-staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to cooperate with u.s. on moussaoui trial berlin will provide washington with evidence for the trial of moussaoui , the only person charged in the u.s. for a role in the sept .

will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .
" but it always comes down to one question : what gets replaced ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " moreover , " she added , " there 's never been a comprehensive scientific study showing that improved fitness really does improve academic performance . " but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .

in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring .

" do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .
" it 's just not regarded by society as important , the way cognitive learning is .
parents do n't pay it enough attention either , even though a child 's movement says a lot about the way a child feels , in a way they ca n't yet express in words . " bildunterschrift : " " not to be esoteric , " she said , " but dance gives you a greater sense of being at one with yourself . "
she 's confident it 's also an answer to poor concentration - the bane of today 's teachers .
" if kids like what they 're doing , " she stressed , " then they 're perfectly good at concentrating .
you just have to break through their lack of interest , " she said . " the whole thing about dance is that it should be fun .
but it ca n't be fun all the time .
in every learning process there is a part that 's boring and that 's hard for kids to understand , but when they understand what it 's all about and why they 're doing it , they manage to get beyond that .
discipline is necessary because it serves a specific purpose - which otherwise is n't always obvious in school . " promoting self-confidence but can dance really be as effective as she says ?
" there 's a tendency to want to boost school ratings by introducing all sorts of random new subjects , " said eva arnold , an education expert from hamburg university .

" but birgit wittermann , a primary school teacher in berlin , said she 'd welcome any opportunity to get kids on their feet , and that dance in particular has a number of advantages .
" sport can be very prescribed , " she said .
" some kids can be a bit intimidated by gym equipment and not everyone can be good at athletics . "
but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .

will taking the emphasis off traditional subjects in favor of more holistic education improve children 's learning abilities ? 10-year-old nick is a star of the soccer pitch and can throw a killer karate kick .
but ask him if he 'd like to join a dance class and he looks horrified .
" yuck , no way ! " he exclaimed .
what about if dance were made a compulsory part of his school syllabus ?
" i would n't come to school , " he said firmly .
" you 're not getting me to dance . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but if anyone can , it 's livia patrizi -lrb- photo -rrb- .
an italian-born dancer and choreographer who 's worked with pina bausch and the cullberg ballet , she teamed up with british choreographer royston maldoom to persuade berlin 's senate for education to help fund a project to establish dance as part of the standard school curriculum .
and nick better watch out . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " when you go to a school and offer a dance class , the problem tends to be that only girls come , " patrizi said .
" but you actually need to reach the ones who need it more , but who do n't realize they do .
in grade one you can still find boys who are interested , but by grade three it 's over .
but actually , when they understand what it 's all about , the boys are the most imaginative and they 're the ones who most need a physical outlet . " so thanks to patrizi and maldoom , at the start of the next school year in august , children from grade one to grade six at 12 berlin schools will be getting down and hoofing it for 90 minutes once a week , overseen by two dance professionals per class .
if the scheme proves successful - a similar project has been up and running in the state of north rhine-westphalia for the past two years - dance could become as much a part of school life as math and spelling . dance the great healer ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not hard to see why the berlin senate for education responded to the project with such enthusiasm .
in germany , as in the rest of the western world , child obesity is on the rise . with the lure of television and computer games , the fact that working parents are too busy to take their children out to the playground , and a school system fixated on academic performance , the nation 's children are an increasingly sluggish bunch . germany 's disappointing showing in the pisa -lrb- program for international student assessment -rrb- and iglu -lrb- international primary school reading survey -rrb- tables certainly confirms the suspicion that children are under-performing . one way or another , the school system appears to be in urgent need of a shake-up .
with its emphasis on a more holistic approach to education , patrizi 's project taps into a certain zeitgeist - one reflected by the success of what was perhaps one of the most memorable documentaries of 2004 . bildunterschrift : in " rhythm is it ! "
royston maldoom -lrb- photo -rrb- joined forces with british conductor sir simon rattle from the berlin philharmonic to get some 250 schoolchildren of disparate ages , ethnicities and backgrounds - with no experience either of classical music or modern dance - on stage for a performance of stravinsky 's " " rite of spring . " an inspirational exploration of how young people can be transformed by the opportunity to step outside the box of conventional education , it taught audiences that music and dance have the potential to change young lives - in more ways than one . " do n't think you 're just dancing ! " bellowed maldoom at one point .
and as the film shows , the children and teenagers who stayed with the project until its finale , learnt far more than just a few dance steps . constructive discipline " movement comes naturally to children , " said patrizi .

but with creative dance , she pointed out , you ca n't go wrong . she 's also aware that kids with learning difficulties are those who would benefit most from the chance to shake a leg .
" children who struggle academically are often the most creative , " she pointed out .
given that germany 's worrying pisa results were largely attributed to the huge disparity in student standards , a class that can narrow performance gaps seems like a promising option . patrizi agreed .
" it gives kids a chance to be validated , " she said . " especially kids who are n't very good at school can get a chance to be seen in a different light . " even so , others feel that school funds could be spent more sensibly .
" if the school is willing to fork out for new projects , i 'd rather they bought some new computers or improved the quality of school dinners , " argued karin s. , a mother of two .
" if my children want to dance , they can take classes in their free time . " but patrizi is quick to emphasize that introducing dance in schools is in fact a far more economical option that sending kids to private dance classes , not to mention the convenience factor .
and anything that makes the school day longer is a boon to germany 's working parents .
as birgit wittermann pointed out : " adding dance classes to the curriculum would tie in perfectly with the need for whole-day schooling .

" we had a very successful first flight and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it , " said claude lelaie , one of the two pilots and the head of the airbus flight division . " there are of course a lot of things to be done , but after this first experience , we now really sense the potential of this magnificent machine , " he said in a statement . the mammoth long-haul airliner , which can carry between 550 and 840 passengers , is due to enter commercial service in mid-2006 , debuting with singapore airlines . tens of thousands of spectators cheered as the a380 double-decker touched down at 2:23 pm -lrb- 1223 gmt -rrb- at toulouse-blagnac airport in southwestern after a successful flight of three hours and 54 minutes .
toulouse is the home of airbus industrie . the airbus prototype took off and landed on runway 32 , dubbed the concorde , from where the world 's only supersonic jetliner made its maiden flight in 1969 . milestone for european unity the applause rippled across europe , as political leaders hailed the achievement as a milestone that proves the might of european unity , a month ahead of a french referendum tipped to reject the proposed european union constitution . french president jacques chirac pointed to the " magnificent result of european industrial cooperation , " and in berlin , deputy economy minister ditmar staffelt called the flight " proof of europe 's high technical capabilities . " in brussels , the european commission called the debut a " success story . "
" the a380 's development shows what europe can do through cooperation and investment in skills , research and technologies , " said industry commissioner guenter verheugen , a german national . the inaugural flight represented a pivotal moment for the european group , which has punched its way to the top of the civil aircraft industry to challenge the boeing 747 's long dominance of the jumbo jet market .
airbus , owned 80 percent by eads 20 percent by bae systems of britain , is banking on the a380 to be the world 's most profitable plane , with a 15-20 percent lower operating cost per seat . security was tightened on the ground and in the air .
two huge parking areas around the airport , enough to accommodate 15,000 cars , were opened and police blocked traffic on nearby roads to allow spectators to approach on foot .
overhead , normal commercial traffic at the airport was suspended only during the 15 minutes before the a380 takeoff , while officials said that airspace was being patrolled to intercept any suspicious planes . a behemoth of the skies it is indeed an aviation giant .
the new airbus , the only twin-deck , four-aisle airliner in the world , can accommodate up to 550 passengers - exceeding the dimensions of everything that has ever landed or taken off from international airports across the globe . the behemoth of the skies came about in response to the steady increase in air passengers .
the german airline , lufthansa has ordered fifteen of the super-birds , scheduled to take to the skies from 2007 .
with his team of 100 people joachim schneider is responsible for the prestigious new fleet . “ we plan to make the a380 our flagship .
we want to be at the head of the pack and that is something that the passenger will ultimately notice , " he said . logistical nightmare however , airport managers between tokyo and los angeles are facing enormous challenges , and not only because they do n't have the runway capacity to deal with the airbus a380 .
they are faced with the logistics of de-icing a 24 meter-high aircraft tail unit , and implementing 90 second evacuation procedures . bildunterschrift : the aviation giant will pose some practical problems on the ground being able to deal with the huge jet will require airport investment to the tune of an estimated 77 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
in germany , munich airport has been technically equipped for the airbus a380 since 2004 , making it the first european airport to be set up for the plane . however , the first german airport to be used for test flights and later for scheduled airline flights will be frankfurt .
fraport services chief wilhelm bender says the airport is well equipped .
“ we were already prepared when terminal 2 came into operation in 1994 .
now we have to make a number of investments in the gate areas and the passenger bridges . ” high hopes for frankfurt along with london and paris , frankfurt hopes to become one of the top three european airports for the a380 .
but it wo n't all be easy sailing for germany ’ s largest airport . local residents who are worried about the noise have already taken legal action aimed at halting any airport extension , which means there is no certainty as to whether the construction of an additional runway planned for 2009 can go ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the skies is not quite big enough for emirates airline huge though it is , the new airbus is still too small to be able to satisfy the expansionist tendencies of the highly profitable arabian airline , emirates , which is calling for planes that can seat up to 800 passengers .
but the dubai-based company has already placed orders for 43 a380 ’ s , making it the number one customer . with an even bigger airbus , low-budget airlines could start operating long-haul flights profitably .
but that in turn is going to require bigger airports on the routes they would fly . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

today , this is difficult to assess . " net income in the company 's second fiscal quarter dropped to 781 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- from 1.2 billion euros at the same time last year , when siemens made generous profits following the sale of a stake in former chip unit infineon technologies ag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld siemens problems lie squarely with its telecommunications unit .
although it is the world 's fifth largest hand-set manufacturer , high labor and site costs make it hard for the german giant to compete with fast-expanding , flexible asian producers . reorganization plans after the fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the mobile phone unit , kleinfeld is planning to remove the thorn in siemens side by reorganizing the branch as a separate business . the company 's new helmsman made it clear there were neither plans to sell nor scrap siemens ' loss-making black sheep .
he said he was positive that there is a solution to be found , " a solution which includes a partner or a string of partners . " there is much speculation about the most likely candidates to join forces with siemens .
at the weekend , germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported that us cell phone manufacturer , motorola inc , is in advanced talks on a possible partnership with the german company .
it said the us company was eager to use such a deal to secure better access to the european market . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : motorola is launching 16 new generation cell phones this year but that particular rumor has surfaced again and again over the past three years , and analysts suggest that with motorola inc 's continental sales already gathering momentum , teaming up with siemens would n't make much sense . the other big name in the rumor mill is taiwanese electronic giant , acer .

today , this is difficult to assess . " net income in the company 's second fiscal quarter dropped to 781 million euros -lrb- $ 1 billion -rrb- from 1.2 billion euros at the same time last year , when siemens made generous profits following the sale of a stake in former chip unit infineon technologies ag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus kleinfeld siemens problems lie squarely with its telecommunications unit .
although it is the world 's fifth largest hand-set manufacturer , high labor and site costs make it hard for the german giant to compete with fast-expanding , flexible asian producers . reorganization plans after the fourth consecutive quarterly loss in the mobile phone unit , kleinfeld is planning to remove the thorn in siemens side by reorganizing the branch as a separate business . the company 's new helmsman made it clear there were neither plans to sell nor scrap siemens ' loss-making black sheep .
he said he was positive that there is a solution to be found , " a solution which includes a partner or a string of partners . " there is much speculation about the most likely candidates to join forces with siemens .

" the dfb control panel and their chairman , horst hilpert , have decided not to fine robert hoyzer 50,000 euros , " said stenger . " but the panel is still demanding a life ban to ensure he never referees another football match . " berlin official hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches in the biggest scandal in german football since 1971 .
he was subsequently suspended by the dfb and arrested in february before being released on police bail after relinquishing his passport .
the disgraced former official is said to have picked up around 67,000 euros and a widescreen television after working in collaboration with croatian mafia circles in berlin .
it was reported earlier in the year that he not only fixed matches but also worked to corrupt other officials at the behest of his underworld paymasters who reaped huge benefits by betting on the matches hoyzer had been paid to rig . hoyzer is said to have been paid a " finder 's fee " by the croatian mafia , banking a reported 10,000 euros for corrupting a bundesliga referee with 5000 euros - the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . betting practices under the microscope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and dfl are meeting to discuss ways to avoid future betting scandals in the wake of the scandal and the associated concerns centered on betting practices , the dfb and german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- signed a rolling contract with security company ' betradar ' in march to monitor betting in german soccer .
" the dfl and dfb have reached an agreement with betradar and will work alongside bookmakers in the future , " wilfried straub , business leader of dfl , told german newspaper die welt last month . betradar has over a 100 betting offices under its wing and uses extensive contacts to report on strange betting patterns and german soccer authorities hope using their expertise will prevent a repeat of the hoyzer scandal . the dfb and dfl are expected to take further steps to prevent the manipulation of matches and betting scandals on wednesday at an emergency meeting in mainz .

" the dfb control panel and their chairman , horst hilpert , have decided not to fine robert hoyzer 50,000 euros , " said stenger . " but the panel is still demanding a life ban to ensure he never referees another football match . " berlin official hoyzer , 25 , has admitted to fixing four matches in the biggest scandal in german football since 1971 .
he was subsequently suspended by the dfb and arrested in february before being released on police bail after relinquishing his passport .
the disgraced former official is said to have picked up around 67,000 euros and a widescreen television after working in collaboration with croatian mafia circles in berlin .
it was reported earlier in the year that he not only fixed matches but also worked to corrupt other officials at the behest of his underworld paymasters who reaped huge benefits by betting on the matches hoyzer had been paid to rig . hoyzer is said to have been paid a " finder 's fee " by the croatian mafia , banking a reported 10,000 euros for corrupting a bundesliga referee with 5000 euros - the purse for performing a similar task on a lower division official . betting practices under the microscope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dfb and dfl are meeting to discuss ways to avoid future betting scandals in the wake of the scandal and the associated concerns centered on betting practices , the dfb and german soccer league -lrb- dfl -rrb- signed a rolling contract with security company ' betradar ' in march to monitor betting in german soccer .
" the dfl and dfb have reached an agreement with betradar and will work alongside bookmakers in the future , " wilfried straub , business leader of dfl , told german newspaper die welt last month . betradar has over a 100 betting offices under its wing and uses extensive contacts to report on strange betting patterns and german soccer authorities hope using their expertise will prevent a repeat of the hoyzer scandal . the dfb and dfl are expected to take further steps to prevent the manipulation of matches and betting scandals on wednesday at an emergency meeting in mainz .
the proposed plan includes a special operating license for bookmakers to take bets on soccer matches which the authorities hope will be in place for the 2006/07 season .
the two authorities are also likely to agree on a ban on players , club officials and match officials from betting on games . emergency federation meeting looks to prevention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : theo zwanziger , vizepraesident des organisationskomitees der fussball-wm 2006 , spricht waehrend einer pressekonferenz in leipzig am dienstag , 27 .

-lrb- ap photo / eckehard schulz -rrb- " the dfl has submitted a proposal for a license for bookmakers in germany to which the board of directors of the dfb has given its initial approval , " dfl president werner hackmann said in a statement . also on the agenda is a proposed betting network operated by both the dfb and dfl and an agreement with existing bookmakers which would see betting shops that offer odds on bundesliga games paying royalties for the privilege to the dfl . dfb and dfl look to control betting sector dfb president theo zwanziger has let it be known that he is in favor of all soccer betting coming under the protection of the dfb and dfl after the world cup is over in 2006 . # b # the betting industry in germany generates an estimated three billion euros annually , a large pie that the soccer associations want to get a bigger slice of .
ideally , zwanziger -lrb- photo -rrb- and his fellow soccer bigwigs would like to have that pie and eat it . it is becoming more apparent that both the dfb and dfl have come to some agreement already of taking the betting industry 's soccer sector under a mutual wing although it appears that until now betting monopolist oddset has yet to be consulted .
german sports broadcaster dsf are also preparing to launch its own betting service . federation plan could raise conflict of interests the german government would be glad to see one competitor challenge oddset 's monopoly and the federal constitutional court in karlsruhe is likely to address the possibility of ending the monopoly in the future but there is growing opposition for that competitor to be a combination of the dfb and dfl among established bookmakers . detlef train , head of austrian bookmaker intertops , said that a federation-owned betting service " could not be neutral " with a conflict of interest to large to ignore . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scandal deals blow to german soccer the widening match-fixing scandal is damaging german soccer 's image in the build-up to the 2006 world cup , organizing committee president franz beckenbauer said tuesday .

such a move is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany . a telephone poll of the 30 biggest cities in the netherlands published in the trouw daily showed that a majority of the cities are in favor of legalizing , under strict conditions , the production of cannabis . despite the growing call from local authorities , the government stood firm on its stricter policy towards soft drugs , in a country where cannabis use and sale have been decriminalized for three decades . " if we are having problems because of our liberal drugs policy than somebody should explain to me how these problems are going to go away if we go even further with our liberal policies , " justice minister piet hein donner said during a parliamentary debate on wednesday . during the debate , several parties including the opposition labour party called for the government to regulate cannabis production .
even the parliamentary faction of the governing vvd liberal party called for a legalization of cannabis production within the european union . legal production a lure for german smokers ? even raising the debate to parliamentary level is likely to further frustrate neighbor germany which continues to struggle with the amount of german citizens crossing the border for the sole purpose of getting legally stoned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily german interior minister otto schily has often clashed with donner over the subject of the dutch coffee shops , establishments which legally sell cannabis and other so-called soft drugs over the counter . schily , a vehement opponent of the dutch attitude to soft drugs , has urged his counterpart to close the coffee shops , saying that the sale of any drugs advocated their use .
and while there has been ground given on the subject of joint police patrols along the two countries ’ shared border in a bid to combat drug trafficking and the possible sale of cannabis to dutch nationals only , there is still conflict over the dutch attitude on its own soil and its consequences . dutch say germans should mind their own but donner argues that the dutch drug policy and the existence of coffee shops offered dutch authorities an opportunity to keep a close check on drug use .
“ even though i understand the german opinion on the question of coffee shops , i must say that it is a question for the dutch and not a problem for our neighbors , ” he said at a heated summit with schily in berlin in 2003 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 1976 , the netherlands have decriminalized the sale and use of cannabis in so called coffee-shops .
a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .

these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .

a typically dutch invention , these special cafes are authorized to sell up to five grams -lrb- one sixth of an ounce -rrb- of cannabis to people over 18 .
production of cannabis remains illegal as do hard drugs like cocaine and heroin . any moves to decriminalize the production of cannabis in the netherlands is likely to cause further friction with schily unlikely to shift on his stance that the availability of drugs in holland promotes drug tourism among germans and , on a wider scale , encourages the illegal drug trade in europe . regulation would solve legal problems , say mayors the mayors of the major dutch cities , including maastricht and amsterdam , argue that a regulated production of cannabis would solve many of the problems connected with illegal cannabis plantations , the main source for the underworld trade . " the drugs policy is schizophrenic because although it is legal for coffee-shops to sell cannabis , the production is illegal .
it is like telling a baker that he can sell bread but is not allowed to buy flour , " maastricht mayor christian democrat gerd leers told afp recently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dutch border towns like maastricht and heerlen receive over a million so-called drugs tourists each year .
these tourists , mostly from france , belgium and germany , come to the netherlands to buy cannabis . to combat illegal cannabis plantations in people 's attics and basements , the mayors call for a regulated and controlled production of cannabis for sale in coffee-shops . legal production will not cure ills , says donner but donner dismissed the argument , saying that the legalization of cannabis production would solve neither the problems of drugs tourism or of illegal growing .
" how will we get one drugs tourist less by regulating cannabis production for sale in coffee-shops ? "
donner asked the parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amsterdam is the main attraction for european drug tourists moreover , he argued , illegal cannabis plantations in maastricht alone grow more drugs than are consumed in the city 's coffee-shops .
" regulating the cultivation for coffee-shops will barely have a noticeable effect on the existing illegal production , " donner said in a letter sent to parliament wednesday . although the government wants to uphold the dutch model that distinguishes between the soft drug , cannabis , which it says poses limited health risks and hard drugs , which pose " unacceptable risks " , it wants to curtail drugs tourism . donner is also in favor of a reduction of the number of coffee-shops which already fell from 1179 in 1997 , to 754 in 2003 .
according to the dutch justice ministry , citing scientific research , the existence of coffee-shops has not led to a rise in cannabis consumption .
cannabis consumption among people aged 15 to 65 is lower in the netherlands than in france , britain or the united states . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money .

" we had a very successful first flight and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it , " said claude lelaie , one of the two pilots and the head of the airbus flight division . " there are of course a lot of things to be done , but after this first experience , we now really sense the potential of this magnificent machine , " he said in a statement . the mammoth long-haul airliner , which can carry between 550 and 840 passengers , is due to enter commercial service in mid-2006 , debuting with singapore airlines . tens of thousands of spectators cheered as the a380 double-decker touched down at 2:23 pm -lrb- 1223 gmt -rrb- at toulouse-blagnac airport in southwestern after a successful flight of three hours and 54 minutes .
toulouse is the home of airbus industrie . the airbus prototype took off and landed on runway 32 , dubbed the concorde , from where the world 's only supersonic jetliner made its maiden flight in 1969 . milestone for european unity the applause rippled across europe , as political leaders hailed the achievement as a milestone that proves the might of european unity , a month ahead of a french referendum tipped to reject the proposed european union constitution . french president jacques chirac pointed to the " magnificent result of european industrial cooperation , " and in berlin , deputy economy minister ditmar staffelt called the flight " proof of europe 's high technical capabilities . " in brussels , the european commission called the debut a " success story . "
" the a380 's development shows what europe can do through cooperation and investment in skills , research and technologies , " said industry commissioner guenter verheugen , a german national . the inaugural flight represented a pivotal moment for the european group , which has punched its way to the top of the civil aircraft industry to challenge the boeing 747 's long dominance of the jumbo jet market .
airbus , owned 80 percent by eads 20 percent by bae systems of britain , is banking on the a380 to be the world 's most profitable plane , with a 15-20 percent lower operating cost per seat . security was tightened on the ground and in the air .
two huge parking areas around the airport , enough to accommodate 15,000 cars , were opened and police blocked traffic on nearby roads to allow spectators to approach on foot .
overhead , normal commercial traffic at the airport was suspended only during the 15 minutes before the a380 takeoff , while officials said that airspace was being patrolled to intercept any suspicious planes . a behemoth of the skies it is indeed an aviation giant .
the new airbus , the only twin-deck , four-aisle airliner in the world , can accommodate up to 550 passengers - exceeding the dimensions of everything that has ever landed or taken off from international airports across the globe . the behemoth of the skies came about in response to the steady increase in air passengers .
the german airline , lufthansa has ordered fifteen of the super-birds , scheduled to take to the skies from 2007 .
with his team of 100 people joachim schneider is responsible for the prestigious new fleet . “ we plan to make the a380 our flagship .
we want to be at the head of the pack and that is something that the passenger will ultimately notice , " he said . logistical nightmare however , airport managers between tokyo and los angeles are facing enormous challenges , and not only because they do n't have the runway capacity to deal with the airbus a380 .
they are faced with the logistics of de-icing a 24 meter-high aircraft tail unit , and implementing 90 second evacuation procedures . bildunterschrift : the aviation giant will pose some practical problems on the ground being able to deal with the huge jet will require airport investment to the tune of an estimated 77 million euros -lrb- $ 100 million -rrb- .
in germany , munich airport has been technically equipped for the airbus a380 since 2004 , making it the first european airport to be set up for the plane . however , the first german airport to be used for test flights and later for scheduled airline flights will be frankfurt .
fraport services chief wilhelm bender says the airport is well equipped .
“ we were already prepared when terminal 2 came into operation in 1994 .
now we have to make a number of investments in the gate areas and the passenger bridges . ” high hopes for frankfurt along with london and paris , frankfurt hopes to become one of the top three european airports for the a380 .
but it wo n't all be easy sailing for germany ’ s largest airport . local residents who are worried about the noise have already taken legal action aimed at halting any airport extension , which means there is no certainty as to whether the construction of an additional runway planned for 2009 can go ahead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : king of the skies is not quite big enough for emirates airline huge though it is , the new airbus is still too small to be able to satisfy the expansionist tendencies of the highly profitable arabian airline , emirates , which is calling for planes that can seat up to 800 passengers .
but the dubai-based company has already placed orders for 43 a380 ’ s , making it the number one customer . with an even bigger airbus , low-budget airlines could start operating long-haul flights profitably .
but that in turn is going to require bigger airports on the routes they would fly . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : less turbulence for airbus , boeing eu trade commissioner peter mandelson and his us counterpart , robert zoellick , have decided to allow more time for talks to settle a transatlantic row over government aid for aviation rivals boeing and airbus .

dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany dw-world : the dumbing down of germany dw-world : gerd 's family policy gets down to business dw-world : study : men in germany are scared to start families germany -pipe- 27.04.2005 encouraging germans to have more kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare saddled with the lowest birth rate in europe , germany is toddling towards shifting the trend .
earlier this year the government passed a law to increase both the quality and quantity of child care opportunities . a law is a law , but that 's not enough for germany 's minister for family affairs , renate schmidt . vigorously waving the flag for working mothers , she has launched an information campaign entitled " more care for kids - germany gets family friendly " , in a bid to make parents aware of both the law and the childcare opportunities on offer across the country . in many ways , her battle is against a relatively new tradition . " i think that for at least the last three , if not four decades , our priorities have been wrong .
by " our " , i mean the national , regional and local approaches , " schmidt said . " locally , community halls were three times more important than child care facilities .
regionally , everything was important except investing in children , and nationally we concentrated on material support , forgetting what else families need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , renate schmidt schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- went on to say that the time has come to change tack , and is hopeful that the new campaign is a step in the right direction . " by the year 2010 we want to create at least 230,000 new child care places for children in western germany , and of course maintain the good day care situation in the eastern part of the country .
passing a law is not enough , it has to be followed through to make sure that action is taken , and that is why we started this campaign , " the family affairs minister added . birth rates and the working woman for schmidt it is crucial to provide parents with the chance to combine a professional life with the desire to have children .
sociology professor ute gerhardt , who is also president of the evangelical action community for family issues says there is a close link between working women and birth rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are often frowned upon for putting babies in daycare she cites france and sweden as countries with high numbers of professional women but which also have high birth rates .
renate schmidt would like to encourage fathers to help prompt a shift . " here in germany , we need to finally realise that it is not necessary to have done everything one can do in a lifetime by the time one reaches the age of 40 or 45 .
in other words , that there are career opportunities at the far side of 45 .
and that means that maybe more fathers will decide to take a career break in order to take care of their children themselves .
and of course we want to provide the best possible day care , meaning that children should not only be taken care of in nurseries or kindergartens , but also by nannies , who should have the necessary qualifications , because there have to be very different forms of care . " corporate input there are some signs that the winds of change have already begun to blow , with large employers heeding the call to help their parenting staff . the cell phone company " e plus " , which has some 3,000 employees , is an example of a company committed to helping its employees .
and in this instance , that does not equate to wage increases or company cars , but to the creation of a company kindergarten . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children stand to benefit from days spent among playmates volkswagen is another top german name prepared to help its employees in childcare matters .
but instead of providing support on the premises , vw sponsors existing day car facilities in and around wolfsburg and helps its employees to find places for their children .

dw-world : work-life balance gets boost in germany dw-world : the dumbing down of germany dw-world : gerd 's family policy gets down to business dw-world : study : men in germany are scared to start families germany -pipe- 27.04.2005 encouraging germans to have more kids großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany needs more daycare saddled with the lowest birth rate in europe , germany is toddling towards shifting the trend .
earlier this year the government passed a law to increase both the quality and quantity of child care opportunities . a law is a law , but that 's not enough for germany 's minister for family affairs , renate schmidt . vigorously waving the flag for working mothers , she has launched an information campaign entitled " more care for kids - germany gets family friendly " , in a bid to make parents aware of both the law and the childcare opportunities on offer across the country . in many ways , her battle is against a relatively new tradition . " i think that for at least the last three , if not four decades , our priorities have been wrong .
by " our " , i mean the national , regional and local approaches , " schmidt said . " locally , community halls were three times more important than child care facilities .
regionally , everything was important except investing in children , and nationally we concentrated on material support , forgetting what else families need . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : minister for family affairs , renate schmidt schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- went on to say that the time has come to change tack , and is hopeful that the new campaign is a step in the right direction . " by the year 2010 we want to create at least 230,000 new child care places for children in western germany , and of course maintain the good day care situation in the eastern part of the country .
passing a law is not enough , it has to be followed through to make sure that action is taken , and that is why we started this campaign , " the family affairs minister added . birth rates and the working woman for schmidt it is crucial to provide parents with the chance to combine a professional life with the desire to have children .
sociology professor ute gerhardt , who is also president of the evangelical action community for family issues says there is a close link between working women and birth rates . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german women are often frowned upon for putting babies in daycare she cites france and sweden as countries with high numbers of professional women but which also have high birth rates .
renate schmidt would like to encourage fathers to help prompt a shift . " here in germany , we need to finally realise that it is not necessary to have done everything one can do in a lifetime by the time one reaches the age of 40 or 45 .
in other words , that there are career opportunities at the far side of 45 .
and that means that maybe more fathers will decide to take a career break in order to take care of their children themselves .
and of course we want to provide the best possible day care , meaning that children should not only be taken care of in nurseries or kindergartens , but also by nannies , who should have the necessary qualifications , because there have to be very different forms of care . " corporate input there are some signs that the winds of change have already begun to blow , with large employers heeding the call to help their parenting staff . the cell phone company " e plus " , which has some 3,000 employees , is an example of a company committed to helping its employees .
and in this instance , that does not equate to wage increases or company cars , but to the creation of a company kindergarten . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children stand to benefit from days spent among playmates volkswagen is another top german name prepared to help its employees in childcare matters .
but instead of providing support on the premises , vw sponsors existing day car facilities in and around wolfsburg and helps its employees to find places for their children .

by alison freeman bbc news , london violent crime is said to be on the increase as a londoner it is easy to worry about crime .
it is a bustling city where we are constantly warned to keep an eye on personal possessions , hear horror stories about attacks on women who get into unlicensed ' taxis ' and live day-to-day with the fear that our city could be the target of terrorists .
but according to crime figures released by the metropolitan police last week , crime in london is decreasing .
the tables showed that there were 45,000 less reported crimes in the capital in 2004/05 than the previous year and there were only two types of crime which increased - sexual offences and violence .
londoners have always suffered more crime compared to others living in other cities dr marian fitzgerald but marian fitzgerald , visiting professor of criminology at kent university , an expert on crime in london , says londoners are still right to be wary of crime as her research shows they do suffer higher levels than people who live elsewhere .
" even after the recent stabbing in little bookham , you are much safer living in the surrey than say southwark , " she said .
" londoners have always suffered more crime compared to others living in other cities because there has always been that extra pull on police .
" after 9/11 police were pulled out of the boroughs where they were located and patrolled the streets of central london to be a reassuring presence .
" we need to see a local presence at a local level for local people . "
the labour party says that in the past five years the number of police officers has increased in london by almost 5,000 to 30,283 and they have introduced three neighbourhood police teams in every borough .
economic and social causes the lib dems are promising a further 2,000 officers in london while the tories say they would put almost 9,000 more police onto the streets as part of their crime policies .
but dr fitzgerald says throwing more bobbies onto the streets is not going to nip the problem in the bud .
she says that years of research have shown that economic and social factors are the key cause of violent crime , with the most deprived boroughs in london suffering the most crime .
dr fitzgerald says she a three-pronged approach will cut crime in addition , while the country is not in recession and people have money to spend on alcohol in pubs and bars , dr fitzgerald says violent crime will always be prevalent .
" the main political parties claim that having more police on the beat is going to make a difference but the criminal justice system actually plays a very small part , " she said .
she says she believes a three-pronged approach to cutting crime is the way ahead , after a world health organisation study of the causes and prevention of violent crime in the world 's major cities .
the first level of this is early intervention with good anti-natal and early child care followed by a secondary level which targets teenagers who are likely to offend .
dr fitzgerald says the third level is the criminal justice system where sentences should act as a deterrent and where the cycle can be broken via education and access to services when jail terms are complete .
a labour party spokeswoman said it had made ' significant progress ' in tackling poverty , social exclusion , unemployment and low educational standards .
' discipline and respect ' it said the sure start scheme for children aimed to reduce the risk of offending and that drug use and associated crime had been successfully targeted with every £ 1 spent on rehabilitation saving 33 in criminal justice costs .
a lib dem spokesman said the party supports the idea of a holistic approach .
the party says its policies would tackle truancy , match enforcement measures with activities for young people and give offenders payback sentences to ' earn back the respect of the community ' .
a spokesman for the conservatives said the party would focus on creating more discipline and respect in society , focussing on schoolchildren who could be sent to ' turnaround ' schools if they are persistently disruptive .
they would bring an end to early release from prison , clearer sentencing with specific minimum terms and create 20,000 more prison places with more education and rehabilitation on offer .

mr lien visited the former leader 's grave as part of a historic eight-day , four-city visit to china .
mr lien is due to hold talks with chinese president hu jintao on friday .
it will be the first meeting between nationalist and communist party leaders since the nationalists fled to taiwan after losing china 's civil war in 1949 .
mr lien , who was born in china , has called his trip to the mainland a journey of peace - saying he hopes it will help the two sides work towards reconciliation after more than half a century of conflict .
critics say mr lien , who steps down this year , sees the visit as a chance to ensure his political legacy .
taiwan-china relations ruled by separate governments since end of chinese civil war in 1949 china considers the island part of its territory china has offered a " one country , two systems " solution , like hong kong most people in taiwan support status quo guide to taiwan flashpoint taiwan 's ruling democratic progressive party , which favours independence from china , says beijing is using the visit to try and split public opinion in taiwan .

closer ties after his visit mr lien addressed the crowd , expressing hope that china and taiwan would co-operate on economic development .
" we must endeavour together to make in the 21st century a truly great chinese people , " he said .
mr lien bowed three times to sun yat-sen 's statue the bbc 's caroline gluck , in taiwan , says the already strained relations between china and taiwan have worsened in the wake of china 's recently passed anti-secession law , which legalises the use of force against taiwan if the island moves towards formal independence .
mr lien is being accompanied by senior officials from the nationalist , or kuomintang , party , and by more than 100 reporters .
the government , initially strongly critical , is now cautiously backing the trip .
president chen shui-bian has said visits to china by opposition leaders would have his blessing if they acted according to the law and did not sign agreements with beijing without government authorisation .
another opposition leader , james soong , head of the pro-unification people first party , has also accepted an invitation to visit the mainland , and is expected to travel to china next month .

the electoral commission estimated 6.5m people , or 15 % of voters , would have applied for postal votes by tuesday 's deadline .
in 2001 it was 1.7m.
there have been concerns about security after post vote fraud scandals in local elections in birmingham and blackburn .
a newspaper advertising campaign warning of the dangers and giving advice has been launched .
steep rises the bbc 's own research , based on responses from 349 of the 646 constituencies , suggested at least 5m postal ballot papers would be sent out .
some marginal seats have seen steep rises in the number of applications for postal votes .
parties have been giving voters application forms and in some cases have been collecting and delivering them in bulk to the elections office .
the parties say they want to encourage voters to register , but in birmingham , election officials say it can delay the process and have asked all parties to stop the practice .
this is an area where the government seems to have put party advantage ahead of the integrity of the system itself liam fox how safe is your postal vote ?
police are also visiting homes in birmingham to check applications are " bona fide " and reassure voters , it was announced on tuesday .
and in a bbc investigation , reporter adrian addison found it easy to steal the vote of a businessman in aldeburgh , suffolk by printing out a form from the electoral commission 's website , filling in his details and posting it off .
the voter , craig mackay , said : " amazing - for this day and age with the way we live in a society where we need id for everything and you just come and take my vote like that - where does that leave me ? "
he got his postal ballot back - as well as his standard voting card through the post .
the returning officer in suffolk said staff at the polling station would notice he had already voted by post when he turned up with his card and he would not have been able to vote twice .
have your say if postal votes are proving to be such a problem , how about internet voting ?
chris peacock , basingstoke send us your comments it follows a judge 's comments earlier this month that fraud was " widespread " in the 2004 local elections in the city , where six labour councillors have been forbidden to stand .
in blackburn , a labour activist was sentenced to three and a half years ' jail after rigging votes in the 2002 local elections .
meanwhile police and election officials in the labour-held marginal seat of bradford , west yorkshire , are contacting 13 people registered to vote at the six-bedroom home of a conservative councillor .
jamshed khan has resigned the conservative whip while investigations continue , but says they are all relatives , some of whom are on holiday , and denies any wrongdoing .
the electoral commission has said it was disappointed its suggestions to make the system more secure had " not been progressed more rapidly " .
' more vigilance ' the chief executive of the electoral reform society ken ritchie said he thought the birmingham case had put a spotlight on the potential for fraud and meant officials would be more vigilant .
but he told bbc news 24 : " undoubtedly there is going to be fraud , but there 's been fraud in every election up until now .
" fraud is particularly easy with postal voting and if we have a lot more postal voting , it just follows that there will be a lot more fraud . "
and conservative party co-chairman liam fox told bbc news 24 : " this is an area where the government seems to have put party advantage ahead of the integrity of the system itself . "
home secretary charles clarke has said everything would be done to prevent fraud , and said guidelines had been sent to police and returning officers .
the liberal democrats have said any extension of postal voting should be ruled out " until the major potential sources of abuse have been eliminated " .

he is not being critical of the 500 effects shots in the film , which involved more than 120 people over a two-year period .
there is nothing wrong with the visual effects - in fact the effects are among the best things about the movie .
but mr johnson is explaining the stylistic approach his firm was asked to use by director garth jennings .
" one of the key challenges was to make sure the visual effects kept in with the style of the movie , the performances , the sets and the basic look of the film , " mr johnson says .
" we did n't want perfect effects . "
the look and feel of the film 's effects were driven by mr jennings ' vision , mr johnson adds .
i would go so far as to have the benny hill theme playing in the background while they were animating matt johnson cinesite " garth would often see early visual effects and say ' that 's fantastic but it is too perfect , " ' mr johnson says .
a classic example was the heart of gold spaceship - ludicrously modelled on a teapot , it comes across as a less than reliable craft .
" one of the things i would always say when we were animating the space ships was to make the space ships ' fly funny ' .
" so i would go so far as to have the benny hill theme playing in the background while they were animating - just to get everyone into that slightly whacky mindset of the film . "
no-one watching hitchhiker 's will feel like they are experiencing 2001 : a space odyssey - with effects that have a slightly wonky , endearing quality to them , often suffused with humour .
in an age in which digital wizardry can be so flawless that they feel cold and artificial , cinesite has worked hard to give the effects a human quality .
" there are lots of things , like re-creating natural problems such as sun glare or fogging , in the sequences to help them sit in with the visual style of the movie . "
both versions of marvin the paranoid android appear in the film some of the film 's effects appear on screen for mere seconds but involved months of work .
" the crab is a completely cgi -lsb- computer generated -rsb- character and only exists in the computer , " says mr johnson .
" garth was very specific about the way the crab jumps and how his hands move .
we spent a long time trying to get the look and the movement of the crab right .
" it 's only in the film for a short time but it is six or seven months of work . "
we see these things hundreds and hundreds of times and you would go mad if you did n't have a bit of fun matt johnson the most impressive visual effects sequence in the film is undoubtedly the tour of the planet factory taken by arthur dent and slartibartfast .
in it , the two men travel through a warehouse the size of a galaxy filled with a host of different planets under construction .
" the planet factory is nine months worth of solid work - about 15 to 20 people working on it , " mr johnson says .
" the backgrounds are a combination of very elaborate paintings to computer-generated structures and gantries . "
it is a stunning sequence and , in common with the film , is filled with humour - the eagle-eyed will spot a planet in the shape of douglas adams ' head .
the planet factory sequence was among the most complex " he had his face scanned before he passed away .
it 's one of those things for the fan boys .
" garth was very much trying to be as true to douglas ' vision as he could be . "
the director insisted on a number of fan-only treats .
some of the detail is astounding - easily picked up when pointed out in an edit suite , but rather more subtle and fleeting when watched in a cinema .
" there 's a las vegas planet with flashing neon signs , a douglas adams planet , all sorts of details in there which warrant repeat viewing , " mr johnson says .
" we do inevitably put layers and layers of stuff in that you know is there .
" we see these things hundreds and hundreds of times and you would go mad if you did n't have a bit of fun and put the odd bits and pieces in which are within the context of the film . "
such details will pass most cinemagoers by - dvd-lovers will get their chance to pore over them for hours , with plenty of hidden visual effect treats still to be discovered .

the commission has been running residential courses with young people aged between 16 and 24 to try to find out the reasons for their apathy .
a piece of artwork has been made to represent the views of those involved in the study .
it is to be unveiled at the long gallery at stormont on wednesday .
stuart mullan , outreach officer at the commission 's belfast office , said their message for young people was that if they did not vote then " in a sense you are automatically taking a step backwards rather than a step forward " .
he said that at the last general election about 35 % of 18 to 24 year olds voted .
students " our research would indicate that young people are much more likely to discuss political issues than any other section of the population , and yet they clearly are n't making the connection between the issues they are passionate about and the ballot box , " he said .
mr mullan said their research indicated that young people felt unrepresented by politicians .
he said the commission would , in particular , target students starting university and college courses because they would be moving from their usual address .
" we 've been helping students register their term-time addresses and also giving them information that helps them link up the issues with the politicians , " he said .
the research will continue throughout the summer and a final report will be published in september .

protesters gathered at addison road in west kensington at 1030 bst before driving into central london .
their route takes them via parliament square , embankment , the strand , trafalgar square , piccadilly circus and regent street .
gordon taylor , chairman of the west london residents ' association , said there is anger over the extension .
campaigners said the extension is unfair , saying only 5 % of the roads covered in the extended zone suffer congestion .
mayor 's backing they said drivers should pay for the use of congested roads only , rather than the camera system used in the existing congestion charge zone in central london .
mayor ken livingstone last year gave his backing to the zone 's extension , which would take it into the borough of kensington & chelsea .
businesses there fear falling trade if the charge comes into force .
everyone will get their opportunity to put any concerns forward to tfl and the mayor about the proposals transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- if it is passed , the extension could be in place by february 2007 at the earliest , transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- said .
a tfl spokesman said any public concerns about the extension would be taken into account .
" in the coming weeks there will be the start of full public consultation of the proposed western extension , " he said .
" everyone will get their opportunity to put any concerns forward to tfl and the mayor about the proposals . "
a spokesman for the national alliance against tolls said : " the planned extension is not the end .
the long term aim of the mayor and tfl is tolls on most london roads .
" tolls just displace traffic on longer routes down less suitable roads and can harm businesses in the charging zones .
the way to stop this threat is to scrap the charge completely . "

the airshow used to attract tens of thousands of people , and was a free spectacle supported by the council .
talks with shepway district council are understood to be at an early stage .
zak deir , managing director of the airport , said the show would still take place in folkestone , and could happen as early as next year .
the shepway airshow was axed because it was not financially viable , but mr deir said he did not think it would cost the airport 's owners as much as before .
he said : " we own an airport and we can offer facilities to the aircraft operating the airshow at a much cheaper rate , or maybe free of charge .
" we could still operate it at folkestone with aircraft taking off and coming back to land at lydd . "
a new airshow is also planned for margate later this year , with its organisers promising it will be the biggest one ever seen in kent .
