" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy . " britain supports a social europe , but it must be a social europe which is adapted to today 's world .
we have to understand why some european economies are creating jobs , and others are not , " blair said in a guest column for germany 's top selling newspaper , bild . failed alliance opinion makers have lamented the spectacular failure of the spd-greens alliance to tackle the country 's most pressing concerns and accused it of dithering , mismanagement and self-indulgence . " red-green , that alliance born in the world of visions , proved itself not to be ready for real life , " the influential newsweekly der spiegel wrote in a withering political obituary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " real reforms were promised but in the end it was again the same paper-shuffling that got the bureaucracy excited but contributed little to alleviating , let alone solving , the most urgent problems of our time . " the coalition swept to power in 1998 with a mandate for change after 16 years of conservative rule under helmut kohl , known as the chancellor of german unity . the youthful schröder , now 61 , and his vice-chancellor and foreign minister joschka fischer , now 57 and a veteran of the 1968 protest movement , pledged to set the country on a course for renewed prosperity . but even the latest reforms - including a labor market overhaul introduced in january - have failed to cut unemployment and are ripping new holes in the public purse . amid prevailing gloom in the economy , one bit of political news sparked a jump in this month 's main indicator of business sentiment : the prospect of early elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de road to early polls fraught with obstacles hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .
dw-world spoke to an expert on german constitutional law about the possible outcomes to this risky undertaking .
-lrb- june 28 , 2005 -rrb- germany takes shaky route to early polls the head of germany 's ruling social democrats has called on his party 's members of parliament to abstain from the upcoming vote of confidence , that would ensure federal elections will be brought forward by a year .
-lrb- june 28 , 2005 -rrb- early elections : strategy or slow suicide ?
the chancellor 's call to germans to seal his fate is one of his greatest political gambles yet .
public opinion is behind early elections , but does gerhard schröder really stand any chance of being re-elected ?

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .
her liver and kidneys do not function properly .
she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .
unusual amounts of body hair began to grow and she put on muscle mass and height . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening of the 10th world youth games in east berlin , 1973 boese was experiencing what an estimated 10,000 athletes in the gdr did - the effects of performance-enhancing drugs on their bodies . these " supporting means , " as the east german language of bureaucracy and obfuscation termed the drugs , were produced by the pharmaceutical company jenapharm , headquartered in the town on jena . legal action but now some of these athletes , who like boese suffer from a variety of medical ailments resulting from the doping , are demanding compensation .
several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.06.2005 germany 's great lakes take shape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from lunar to lake landscape a former coal-mining region in eastern germany is hoping to escape a depressing future by being reborn as a vacation paradise thanks to plans to flood the area , creating a whole region of new lakes . the people of the lausitz , a region southeast of berlin , were promised a flourishing future - as were all east germans - by the politicians who oversaw german reunification .
but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy . " britain supports a social europe , but it must be a social europe which is adapted to today 's world .
we have to understand why some european economies are creating jobs , and others are not , " blair said in a guest column for germany 's top selling newspaper , bild . failed alliance opinion makers have lamented the spectacular failure of the spd-greens alliance to tackle the country 's most pressing concerns and accused it of dithering , mismanagement and self-indulgence . " red-green , that alliance born in the world of visions , proved itself not to be ready for real life , " the influential newsweekly der spiegel wrote in a withering political obituary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " real reforms were promised but in the end it was again the same paper-shuffling that got the bureaucracy excited but contributed little to alleviating , let alone solving , the most urgent problems of our time . " the coalition swept to power in 1998 with a mandate for change after 16 years of conservative rule under helmut kohl , known as the chancellor of german unity . the youthful schröder , now 61 , and his vice-chancellor and foreign minister joschka fischer , now 57 and a veteran of the 1968 protest movement , pledged to set the country on a course for renewed prosperity . but even the latest reforms - including a labor market overhaul introduced in january - have failed to cut unemployment and are ripping new holes in the public purse . amid prevailing gloom in the economy , one bit of political news sparked a jump in this month 's main indicator of business sentiment : the prospect of early elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de road to early polls fraught with obstacles hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .

but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

4 , 2004 -rrb- german wetland under threat the spree forest , a remote wetland south of berlin , is a nature-lover 's paradise known for its many narrow waterways .
but researchers say the pristine region is in danger , blaming changes in climate and industry .

the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people . " we placed two aggro cds on our index at the end of may and there are several more we are processing , " petra meier , bpjm 's deputy head , told dw-world . the " index " is a list of media considered harmful or dangerous to minors .
this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .
indeed , the texts glorify sexual violence , drugs and the perverse degradation of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aggro label in berlin is home to many controversial rappers " the lyrics by certain german rappers , in particular those from the aggro label in berlin , are becoming increasingly more pornographic , racist and glorified violence , " monika griefahn , chairperson of the parliamentary committee on culture and the media , said in a statement earlier this month . this was also the case in the songs ' corresponding videos . " the misogynist and in part right-wing songs are full of violence and pornography , " griefahn said . listeners are responsible for their own actions despite official criticism , fans see aggro rappers as the german answer to us star 50 cent and his consorts .
according to the label , their bands are simply rapping about the social realities in the high-rise ghettos . " whether it 's financial problems , club nights , idol worship or anal intercourse , sido feeds from a tremendous diversity of topics , " aggro said on its web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushido 's album " carlo cokxxx nutten 2 " refers to women as " whores " bushido said he does n't feel personally responsible for the impact of his music .

" it 's up to me to decide whether it influences my way of thinking . " censorship makes the music more attractive roland seim , a sociologist specializing in censorship , said that although prohibited things may not be particularly interesting , they become so through banning them . " this is especially the case in many youth cultures , which are supposed to be shielded from all sorts of influences , " seim wrote in a study .

the boyish midfielder turned and , without hesitating , unleashed a straight shot to the upper right corner of the net which lux could not get a hold of . argentina appeared visibly shaken by brazil 's early lead .
though the gauchos had made good attempts in the brazil half of the field , they made nothing out of their chances .

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .
her liver and kidneys do not function properly .
she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .
unusual amounts of body hair began to grow and she put on muscle mass and height . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening of the 10th world youth games in east berlin , 1973 boese was experiencing what an estimated 10,000 athletes in the gdr did - the effects of performance-enhancing drugs on their bodies . these " supporting means , " as the east german language of bureaucracy and obfuscation termed the drugs , were produced by the pharmaceutical company jenapharm , headquartered in the town on jena . legal action but now some of these athletes , who like boese suffer from a variety of medical ailments resulting from the doping , are demanding compensation .
several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .
" you ca n't just go walking over bodies and abusing children to achieve your own political ends .

victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .

in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .

several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .

the selecao 's domination served notice as to who was the favorite come world cup time next year . two goals from adriano , pure magic by the brazilian midfield and solid work by the brazil defense sent the defending world champions the confederations cup glory on wednesday evening . the 4-1 victory over an unrecognizable argentina , showcased the very best in brazilian talent , with every one of their world class players notching a goal , and adriano getting two .
in mashing the opponents that had beaten them 3-1 in world cup qualifiers earlier in the month , brazil reaffirmed as favorites to win the big trophy when the world cup kicks off in germany next year . " i 'm happy and proud that everything worked out so well , " said adriano , who was voted player of the tournament .
" to win the cup ahead of the world cup was very important to us . " with stars to spare though playing without world class striker ronaldo , midfielder cafu and defender roberto carlos and stumbling -lrb- for them -rrb- through the tournament with a loss against mexico and a difficult win against japan , brazil was nothing but top form against their fiercest rivals . the selecao got going early in the match , making the most out of its few chances .
adriano showed again why he has been the most prolific goal-scorer in this tournament , unleashing a rocket in the 11th minute to give his side the lead .
as the argentine defense to contain him along the top of the penalty box , adriano powered his way laterally along the line and unleashed one of his trademark shots .

a moment later , brazil answered out of nowhere . a long ball on the left side to robinho and the young sensation played it to kaka .
the boyish midfielder turned and , without hesitating , unleashed a straight shot to the upper right corner of the net which lux could not get a hold of . argentina appeared visibly shaken by brazil 's early lead .
though the gauchos had made good attempts in the brazil half of the field , they made nothing out of their chances .
brazil , with two real ones , made two goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lucio , left , challenges argentina 's luciano figueroa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2005 censoring german rap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin rapper sido is best known for his song about anal intercourse some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people . " we placed two aggro cds on our index at the end of may and there are several more we are processing , " petra meier , bpjm 's deputy head , told dw-world . the " index " is a list of media considered harmful or dangerous to minors .
this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .
indeed , the texts glorify sexual violence , drugs and the perverse degradation of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aggro label in berlin is home to many controversial rappers " the lyrics by certain german rappers , in particular those from the aggro label in berlin , are becoming increasingly more pornographic , racist and glorified violence , " monika griefahn , chairperson of the parliamentary committee on culture and the media , said in a statement earlier this month . this was also the case in the songs ' corresponding videos . " the misogynist and in part right-wing songs are full of violence and pornography , " griefahn said . listeners are responsible for their own actions despite official criticism , fans see aggro rappers as the german answer to us star 50 cent and his consorts .
according to the label , their bands are simply rapping about the social realities in the high-rise ghettos . " whether it 's financial problems , club nights , idol worship or anal intercourse , sido feeds from a tremendous diversity of topics , " aggro said on its web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushido 's album " carlo cokxxx nutten 2 " refers to women as " whores " bushido said he does n't feel personally responsible for the impact of his music . " if i listen to rammstein or eminem , i know that it 's just music and not my life , " bushido told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" it 's up to me to decide whether it influences my way of thinking . " censorship makes the music more attractive roland seim , a sociologist specializing in censorship , said that although prohibited things may not be particularly interesting , they become so through banning them . " this is especially the case in many youth cultures , which are supposed to be shielded from all sorts of influences , " seim wrote in a study .
" forbidden areas in particular appeal to them as minors , to find out something they 're actually not supposed to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial rappers say consumers have to make up their own minds for bushido , young people should be able to listen to his songs , but know where to draw the line . " i tell these kids : if you press play and listen to my cd , you get 70 minutes of my life , " bushido said .
" when you press stop , you 're back in your lives , with your parents , your teachers and the police , who 'll arrest you if you screw up . " freedom of expression needs limits griefahn said that radio stations and music television channels like viva and mtv also had to better exercise their obligation of control . " it just ca n't be that these stations neglect this critical responsibility , " griefahn said . " breaking taboos and portraying extremes are important stylistic devices of art , which rightly belong to the freedom of expression , " she said .
however , the protection of youth and the right of personal honor required clear restrictions . and , she added , this kind of rap shed a poor light on german music . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.06.2005 confidence vote to be based on deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lonely schröder wants a new mandate for his reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder huddled with his ministers wednesday ahead of a vote this week that will set the wheels in motion for early elections expected to end his seven-year hold on power . sources said schröder told his cabinet he would justify his decision to call a no confidence vote in an address before parliament friday by saying that his government can not operate effectively , since it " lacks the ability to function " due to divisions within his party and a strong opposition . the chancellor stunned the country last month after suffering the latest in a string of state poll debacles by announcing he would seek national elections one year ahead of schedule to shore up his ailing government . his spokesman bela anda later denied the account of wednesday 's closed-door meeting , saying only that schröder made his decision based on whether " he could have constant faith in a parliamentary majority for his policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy . " britain supports a social europe , but it must be a social europe which is adapted to today 's world .
we have to understand why some european economies are creating jobs , and others are not , " blair said in a guest column for germany 's top selling newspaper , bild . failed alliance opinion makers have lamented the spectacular failure of the spd-greens alliance to tackle the country 's most pressing concerns and accused it of dithering , mismanagement and self-indulgence . " red-green , that alliance born in the world of visions , proved itself not to be ready for real life , " the influential newsweekly der spiegel wrote in a withering political obituary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " real reforms were promised but in the end it was again the same paper-shuffling that got the bureaucracy excited but contributed little to alleviating , let alone solving , the most urgent problems of our time . " the coalition swept to power in 1998 with a mandate for change after 16 years of conservative rule under helmut kohl , known as the chancellor of german unity . the youthful schröder , now 61 , and his vice-chancellor and foreign minister joschka fischer , now 57 and a veteran of the 1968 protest movement , pledged to set the country on a course for renewed prosperity . but even the latest reforms - including a labor market overhaul introduced in january - have failed to cut unemployment and are ripping new holes in the public purse . amid prevailing gloom in the economy , one bit of political news sparked a jump in this month 's main indicator of business sentiment : the prospect of early elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de road to early polls fraught with obstacles hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .

she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .

several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .

while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .

her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.06.2005 germany 's great lakes take shape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from lunar to lake landscape a former coal-mining region in eastern germany is hoping to escape a depressing future by being reborn as a vacation paradise thanks to plans to flood the area , creating a whole region of new lakes . the people of the lausitz , a region southeast of berlin , were promised a flourishing future - as were all east germans - by the politicians who oversaw german reunification .
but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2005 censoring german rap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin rapper sido is best known for his song about anal intercourse some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people . " we placed two aggro cds on our index at the end of may and there are several more we are processing , " petra meier , bpjm 's deputy head , told dw-world . the " index " is a list of media considered harmful or dangerous to minors .
this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .
indeed , the texts glorify sexual violence , drugs and the perverse degradation of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aggro label in berlin is home to many controversial rappers " the lyrics by certain german rappers , in particular those from the aggro label in berlin , are becoming increasingly more pornographic , racist and glorified violence , " monika griefahn , chairperson of the parliamentary committee on culture and the media , said in a statement earlier this month . this was also the case in the songs ' corresponding videos . " the misogynist and in part right-wing songs are full of violence and pornography , " griefahn said . listeners are responsible for their own actions despite official criticism , fans see aggro rappers as the german answer to us star 50 cent and his consorts .
according to the label , their bands are simply rapping about the social realities in the high-rise ghettos . " whether it 's financial problems , club nights , idol worship or anal intercourse , sido feeds from a tremendous diversity of topics , " aggro said on its web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushido 's album " carlo cokxxx nutten 2 " refers to women as " whores " bushido said he does n't feel personally responsible for the impact of his music . " if i listen to rammstein or eminem , i know that it 's just music and not my life , " bushido told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" it 's up to me to decide whether it influences my way of thinking . " censorship makes the music more attractive roland seim , a sociologist specializing in censorship , said that although prohibited things may not be particularly interesting , they become so through banning them . " this is especially the case in many youth cultures , which are supposed to be shielded from all sorts of influences , " seim wrote in a study .
" forbidden areas in particular appeal to them as minors , to find out something they 're actually not supposed to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial rappers say consumers have to make up their own minds for bushido , young people should be able to listen to his songs , but know where to draw the line . " i tell these kids : if you press play and listen to my cd , you get 70 minutes of my life , " bushido said .
" when you press stop , you 're back in your lives , with your parents , your teachers and the police , who 'll arrest you if you screw up . " freedom of expression needs limits griefahn said that radio stations and music television channels like viva and mtv also had to better exercise their obligation of control . " it just ca n't be that these stations neglect this critical responsibility , " griefahn said . " breaking taboos and portraying extremes are important stylistic devices of art , which rightly belong to the freedom of expression , " she said .
however , the protection of youth and the right of personal honor required clear restrictions . and , she added , this kind of rap shed a poor light on german music . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people . " we placed two aggro cds on our index at the end of may and there are several more we are processing , " petra meier , bpjm 's deputy head , told dw-world . the " index " is a list of media considered harmful or dangerous to minors .
this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .
indeed , the texts glorify sexual violence , drugs and the perverse degradation of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aggro label in berlin is home to many controversial rappers " the lyrics by certain german rappers , in particular those from the aggro label in berlin , are becoming increasingly more pornographic , racist and glorified violence , " monika griefahn , chairperson of the parliamentary committee on culture and the media , said in a statement earlier this month . this was also the case in the songs ' corresponding videos . " the misogynist and in part right-wing songs are full of violence and pornography , " griefahn said . listeners are responsible for their own actions despite official criticism , fans see aggro rappers as the german answer to us star 50 cent and his consorts .
according to the label , their bands are simply rapping about the social realities in the high-rise ghettos . " whether it 's financial problems , club nights , idol worship or anal intercourse , sido feeds from a tremendous diversity of topics , " aggro said on its web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushido 's album " carlo cokxxx nutten 2 " refers to women as " whores " bushido said he does n't feel personally responsible for the impact of his music . " if i listen to rammstein or eminem , i know that it 's just music and not my life , " bushido told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" it 's up to me to decide whether it influences my way of thinking . " censorship makes the music more attractive roland seim , a sociologist specializing in censorship , said that although prohibited things may not be particularly interesting , they become so through banning them . " this is especially the case in many youth cultures , which are supposed to be shielded from all sorts of influences , " seim wrote in a study .
" forbidden areas in particular appeal to them as minors , to find out something they 're actually not supposed to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial rappers say consumers have to make up their own minds for bushido , young people should be able to listen to his songs , but know where to draw the line . " i tell these kids : if you press play and listen to my cd , you get 70 minutes of my life , " bushido said .
" when you press stop , you 're back in your lives , with your parents , your teachers and the police , who 'll arrest you if you screw up . " freedom of expression needs limits griefahn said that radio stations and music television channels like viva and mtv also had to better exercise their obligation of control . " it just ca n't be that these stations neglect this critical responsibility , " griefahn said . " breaking taboos and portraying extremes are important stylistic devices of art , which rightly belong to the freedom of expression , " she said .
however , the protection of youth and the right of personal honor required clear restrictions . and , she added , this kind of rap shed a poor light on german music . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

brazil and argentina may have stumbled along the way but they eventually lived up to their star billing by making it through to wednesday 's confederations cup final in frankfurt . this dream match-up between the south american soccer superpowers is seen by many as a potential dress rehearsal for the world cup final back in germany next year .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira singled out juan roman riquelme and juan pablo sorin as argentina 's dangermen .
but he watched argentina 's at times strong-armed win over mexico in sunday 's semi-final and insisted brazil were up for anything the argentines threw at them .
" brazil can not be intimidated .
we must concentrate on playing football because , although argentina has a very good team , brazil are not afraid of a tough match , " parreira said .
" because of the historical rivalry there are no friendly games between brazil and argentina . "

" it 's going to be a great match , i 'm thrilled to have the chance to play in this " clasico " , said the villareal player who notched up a hat-trick against australia .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul " if turkey will not be able to -lrb- join -rrb- we must ensure that she is fully anchored in the european structures , " said rehn , who forecast that talk of a " privileged partnership " with turkey rather than full eu membership will likely feature in the debate on the issue . and the eu 's constitution crisis has clouded the issue even further .
opposition to turkey 's eu hopes was seen as a key factor behind the " no " votes , and eu leaders have pledged to react by listening more to ordinary europeans . a " hold " on enlargement ? more fuel was adding to those burning issues on monday by interior minister and presidential hopeful nicolas sarkozy who called for eu enlargement to be put on hold to give time for its internal institutions to be " renovated . " " enlargement must be suspended at least as long as the institutions have not been renovated .

on the eve of the eu proposals , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called on the bloc to show that it is a not a " christian club " by admitting his country as a member . " if you really think the eu is not a christian club , you must arrange it so that turkey joins you , " he told a seminar tuesday night .
" we hope that the eu becomes a crossing point where civilizations can find one another , " he added . eu commission head jose manuel barroso , while insisting that talks are due to start in october , has also acknowledged that the eu needed to " discuss seriously " public concerns about the country 's possible membership . " it will be a complete mistake not to look at this issue seriously , " he said last week .

brazil and argentina may have stumbled along the way but they eventually lived up to their star billing by making it through to wednesday 's confederations cup final in frankfurt . this dream match-up between the south american soccer superpowers is seen by many as a potential dress rehearsal for the world cup final back in germany next year .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira singled out juan roman riquelme and juan pablo sorin as argentina 's dangermen .
but he watched argentina 's at times strong-armed win over mexico in sunday 's semi-final and insisted brazil were up for anything the argentines threw at them .
" brazil can not be intimidated .
we must concentrate on playing football because , although argentina has a very good team , brazil are not afraid of a tough match , " parreira said .
" because of the historical rivalry there are no friendly games between brazil and argentina . "

-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- ronaldinho , who burst onto the scene at the 1999 confed cup where brazil were stunned 4-3 in the final by mexico , concurred .
" we are eternal rivals so this is a final that motivates us a lot , " barcelona 's world footballer of the year said .
wednesday 's mouth-watering final offers brazil a chance for quick revenge after the 3-1 mauling by jose pekerman 's side in this month 's world cup qualifier .
brazil 's confed cup campaign started brightly against greece but then came that shock 1-0 defeat to mexico which meant a do-or-die clash in their final group game against japan .
goals from robinho and ronaldinho put them through as group b runners-up .
argentina , in contrast , sailed through the group stages , with wins against tunisia , australia and a draw with germany .
but the two time world cup winners almost came to grief in the semi-finals against mexico when only luciano figueroa 's 110th minute equalizer set up a penalty shoot-out where they prevailed 6-5 .
" it 's going to be a great match , i 'm thrilled to have the chance to play in this " clasico " , said the villareal player who notched up a hat-trick against australia .

adriano fit brazil 's bull of an attacker adriano , scorer of two of the goals in the 3-2 semi-final win over germany , limped out of training monday but was later declared fit to take part .
with brazil having beaten germany on saturday , argentina have had one day less to prepare for the final , and they also had to endure 30 minutes of stamina-sapping extra time in sunday 's semi-final , but pekerman shrugged off fatigue as a factor .
" my team are young and ambitious , we 'll be ready for brazil , " he said .
the countries have met 92 times before , with the score changing depending on which camp you talk to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.06.2005 confidence vote to be based on deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lonely schröder wants a new mandate for his reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder huddled with his ministers wednesday ahead of a vote this week that will set the wheels in motion for early elections expected to end his seven-year hold on power . sources said schröder told his cabinet he would justify his decision to call a no confidence vote in an address before parliament friday by saying that his government can not operate effectively , since it " lacks the ability to function " due to divisions within his party and a strong opposition . the chancellor stunned the country last month after suffering the latest in a string of state poll debacles by announcing he would seek national elections one year ahead of schedule to shore up his ailing government . his spokesman bela anda later denied the account of wednesday 's closed-door meeting , saying only that schröder made his decision based on whether " he could have constant faith in a parliamentary majority for his policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy . " britain supports a social europe , but it must be a social europe which is adapted to today 's world .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy .

but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

" " because of the historical rivalry there are no friendly games between brazil and argentina , " added parreira , in his third spell as the national coach . ronaldinho , who burst onto the scene at the 1999 confed cup where brazil were stunned 4-3 in the final by mexico , concurred : " we are eternal rivals so this is a final that motivates us a lot , " barcelona 's world footballer of the year said . opportunity to avenge buenos aires defeat wednesday 's cliffhanger offers brazil a chance for quick revenge after the world champion 's 3-1 mauling by jose pekerman 's side in this month 's world cup qualifier . brazil 's confed cup campaign started brightly against greece but then came that shock 1-0 defeat to mexico which meant a do-or-die clash in their final group game against japan .
goals from robinho and ronaldinho put them narrowly through as group b runners-up . bildunterschrift : argentina in contrast sailed through the group stages , with wins against tunisia , australia and a draw with germany .
but the two time world cup winners almost came to grief in the semi-finals against mexico when only luciano figueroa 's 110th minute equalizer set up a penalty shoot-out where they prevailed 6-5 . " it 's going to be a great match , i 'm thrilled to have the chance to play in this clásico " , said the villareal player who notched up a hat-trick against australia . no saviola but adriano will play argentina face the reigning world champions without striker javier saviola , suspended after being sent off against mexico .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.06.2005 confidence vote to be based on deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lonely schröder wants a new mandate for his reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder huddled with his ministers wednesday ahead of a vote this week that will set the wheels in motion for early elections expected to end his seven-year hold on power . sources said schröder told his cabinet he would justify his decision to call a no confidence vote in an address before parliament friday by saying that his government can not operate effectively , since it " lacks the ability to function " due to divisions within his party and a strong opposition . the chancellor stunned the country last month after suffering the latest in a string of state poll debacles by announcing he would seek national elections one year ahead of schedule to shore up his ailing government . his spokesman bela anda later denied the account of wednesday 's closed-door meeting , saying only that schröder made his decision based on whether " he could have constant faith in a parliamentary majority for his policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy . " britain supports a social europe , but it must be a social europe which is adapted to today 's world .
we have to understand why some european economies are creating jobs , and others are not , " blair said in a guest column for germany 's top selling newspaper , bild . failed alliance opinion makers have lamented the spectacular failure of the spd-greens alliance to tackle the country 's most pressing concerns and accused it of dithering , mismanagement and self-indulgence . " red-green , that alliance born in the world of visions , proved itself not to be ready for real life , " the influential newsweekly der spiegel wrote in a withering political obituary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " real reforms were promised but in the end it was again the same paper-shuffling that got the bureaucracy excited but contributed little to alleviating , let alone solving , the most urgent problems of our time . " the coalition swept to power in 1998 with a mandate for change after 16 years of conservative rule under helmut kohl , known as the chancellor of german unity . the youthful schröder , now 61 , and his vice-chancellor and foreign minister joschka fischer , now 57 and a veteran of the 1968 protest movement , pledged to set the country on a course for renewed prosperity . but even the latest reforms - including a labor market overhaul introduced in january - have failed to cut unemployment and are ripping new holes in the public purse . amid prevailing gloom in the economy , one bit of political news sparked a jump in this month 's main indicator of business sentiment : the prospect of early elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de road to early polls fraught with obstacles hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy . " britain supports a social europe , but it must be a social europe which is adapted to today 's world .
we have to understand why some european economies are creating jobs , and others are not , " blair said in a guest column for germany 's top selling newspaper , bild . failed alliance opinion makers have lamented the spectacular failure of the spd-greens alliance to tackle the country 's most pressing concerns and accused it of dithering , mismanagement and self-indulgence . " red-green , that alliance born in the world of visions , proved itself not to be ready for real life , " the influential newsweekly der spiegel wrote in a withering political obituary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " real reforms were promised but in the end it was again the same paper-shuffling that got the bureaucracy excited but contributed little to alleviating , let alone solving , the most urgent problems of our time . " the coalition swept to power in 1998 with a mandate for change after 16 years of conservative rule under helmut kohl , known as the chancellor of german unity . the youthful schröder , now 61 , and his vice-chancellor and foreign minister joschka fischer , now 57 and a veteran of the 1968 protest movement , pledged to set the country on a course for renewed prosperity . but even the latest reforms - including a labor market overhaul introduced in january - have failed to cut unemployment and are ripping new holes in the public purse . amid prevailing gloom in the economy , one bit of political news sparked a jump in this month 's main indicator of business sentiment : the prospect of early elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de road to early polls fraught with obstacles hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .

in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .

several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .
" you ca n't just go walking over bodies and abusing children to achieve your own political ends .
i ca n't understand that .

she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .

several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

in mashing the opponents that had beaten them 3-1 in world cup qualifiers earlier in the month , brazil reaffirmed as favorites to win the big trophy when the world cup kicks off in germany next year . " i 'm happy and proud that everything worked out so well , " said adriano , who was voted player of the tournament .

adriano showed again why he has been the most prolific goal-scorer in this tournament , unleashing a rocket in the 11th minute to give his side the lead .
as the argentine defense to contain him along the top of the penalty box , adriano powered his way laterally along the line and unleashed one of his trademark shots .

a moment later , brazil answered out of nowhere . a long ball on the left side to robinho and the young sensation played it to kaka .
the boyish midfielder turned and , without hesitating , unleashed a straight shot to the upper right corner of the net which lux could not get a hold of . argentina appeared visibly shaken by brazil 's early lead .

her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .

" bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .
her liver and kidneys do not function properly .
she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .
unusual amounts of body hair began to grow and she put on muscle mass and height . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening of the 10th world youth games in east berlin , 1973 boese was experiencing what an estimated 10,000 athletes in the gdr did - the effects of performance-enhancing drugs on their bodies . these " supporting means , " as the east german language of bureaucracy and obfuscation termed the drugs , were produced by the pharmaceutical company jenapharm , headquartered in the town on jena . legal action but now some of these athletes , who like boese suffer from a variety of medical ailments resulting from the doping , are demanding compensation .
several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .

while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .

at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .
her liver and kidneys do not function properly .
she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .
unusual amounts of body hair began to grow and she put on muscle mass and height . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening of the 10th world youth games in east berlin , 1973 boese was experiencing what an estimated 10,000 athletes in the gdr did - the effects of performance-enhancing drugs on their bodies . these " supporting means , " as the east german language of bureaucracy and obfuscation termed the drugs , were produced by the pharmaceutical company jenapharm , headquartered in the town on jena . legal action but now some of these athletes , who like boese suffer from a variety of medical ailments resulting from the doping , are demanding compensation .
several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .

while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

he was arrested on march 25 in rotterdam and been held since then in investigative custody .
hasan huseyin k. is suspected of leading a regional chapter of the dhkp-c - which is on the terror lists of turkey , the european union and the united states - from early 1996 to mid-1997 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.06.2005 -pipe- 12:00 utc imf cuts 2006 german growth forecast the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- has revised downwards its forecast for german growth next year to 1.3 percent from 1.8 percent previously , a source close to the fund said on wednesday .
at the same time , the imf revised upwards slightly its forecast for growth of the eurozone 's biggest economy this year to 1.0 percent from an earlier forecast of 0.8 percent , the source said .
the fund 's 2006 forecast , officially scheduled to be published later on wednesday , was less optimistic than the german government , which is forecasting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.6 percent next year . but other observers are also sceptical about the strength of any german recovery .
the berlin-based think-tank diw said in its latest weekly report that it was penciling in growth of just 0.9 percent this year and only 1.5 percent next year . " no strong upturn is on the horizon , " diw said .
growth would continue to be driven primarily by exports , while domestic demand was expected to remain weak .
" so far , the spark from booming exports has not been able to jump over to domestic demand , " diw wrote . " the unexpectedly high rate of growth in the first quarter was solely attributable to buoyant foreign trade . " german gdp expanded by 1.0 percent and was expected to stand at 10.9 percent in 2005 and decline to 10.1 percent in 2006 . nevertheless , there were substantial risks to its latest forecasts , diw said .
the prognoses were made on the assumption that oil prices would decline to $ 48 -lrb- 39.83 euros -rrb- per barrel this year , that the euro exchange rate would average around $ 1.22 and that the european central bank would cut interest rates by half a percentage point in the coming months .
" the likelihood is big that some of these assumptions will not be met , " diw said . dw-world.de early elections may help german economy the proposed early general election would be good for the german economy , according to experts .
but regardless of the poll 's outcome , the effects of globalization wo n't be stemmed and any positive impact will take years .

at the same time , the imf revised upwards slightly its forecast for growth of the eurozone 's biggest economy this year to 1.0 percent from an earlier forecast of 0.8 percent , the source said .
the fund 's 2006 forecast , officially scheduled to be published later on wednesday , was less optimistic than the german government , which is forecasting gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth of 1.6 percent next year . but other observers are also sceptical about the strength of any german recovery .
the berlin-based think-tank diw said in its latest weekly report that it was penciling in growth of just 0.9 percent this year and only 1.5 percent next year . " no strong upturn is on the horizon , " diw said .
growth would continue to be driven primarily by exports , while domestic demand was expected to remain weak .
" so far , the spark from booming exports has not been able to jump over to domestic demand , " diw wrote . " the unexpectedly high rate of growth in the first quarter was solely attributable to buoyant foreign trade . " german gdp expanded by 1.0 percent and was expected to stand at 10.9 percent in 2005 and decline to 10.1 percent in 2006 . nevertheless , there were substantial risks to its latest forecasts , diw said .
the prognoses were made on the assumption that oil prices would decline to $ 48 -lrb- 39.83 euros -rrb- per barrel this year , that the euro exchange rate would average around $ 1.22 and that the european central bank would cut interest rates by half a percentage point in the coming months .

the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people . " we placed two aggro cds on our index at the end of may and there are several more we are processing , " petra meier , bpjm 's deputy head , told dw-world . the " index " is a list of media considered harmful or dangerous to minors .
this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .
indeed , the texts glorify sexual violence , drugs and the perverse degradation of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aggro label in berlin is home to many controversial rappers " the lyrics by certain german rappers , in particular those from the aggro label in berlin , are becoming increasingly more pornographic , racist and glorified violence , " monika griefahn , chairperson of the parliamentary committee on culture and the media , said in a statement earlier this month . this was also the case in the songs ' corresponding videos . " the misogynist and in part right-wing songs are full of violence and pornography , " griefahn said . listeners are responsible for their own actions despite official criticism , fans see aggro rappers as the german answer to us star 50 cent and his consorts .
according to the label , their bands are simply rapping about the social realities in the high-rise ghettos . " whether it 's financial problems , club nights , idol worship or anal intercourse , sido feeds from a tremendous diversity of topics , " aggro said on its web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushido 's album " carlo cokxxx nutten 2 " refers to women as " whores " bushido said he does n't feel personally responsible for the impact of his music . " if i listen to rammstein or eminem , i know that it 's just music and not my life , " bushido told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" it 's up to me to decide whether it influences my way of thinking . " censorship makes the music more attractive roland seim , a sociologist specializing in censorship , said that although prohibited things may not be particularly interesting , they become so through banning them . " this is especially the case in many youth cultures , which are supposed to be shielded from all sorts of influences , " seim wrote in a study .
" forbidden areas in particular appeal to them as minors , to find out something they 're actually not supposed to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial rappers say consumers have to make up their own minds for bushido , young people should be able to listen to his songs , but know where to draw the line . " i tell these kids : if you press play and listen to my cd , you get 70 minutes of my life , " bushido said .
" when you press stop , you 're back in your lives , with your parents , your teachers and the police , who 'll arrest you if you screw up . " freedom of expression needs limits griefahn said that radio stations and music television channels like viva and mtv also had to better exercise their obligation of control . " it just ca n't be that these stations neglect this critical responsibility , " griefahn said . " breaking taboos and portraying extremes are important stylistic devices of art , which rightly belong to the freedom of expression , " she said .
however , the protection of youth and the right of personal honor required clear restrictions . and , she added , this kind of rap shed a poor light on german music . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ?

the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

brazil and argentina may have stumbled along the way but they eventually lived up to their star billing by making it through to wednesday 's confederations cup final in frankfurt . this dream match-up between the south american soccer superpowers is seen by many as a potential dress rehearsal for the world cup final back in germany next year .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira singled out juan roman riquelme and juan pablo sorin as argentina 's dangermen .
but he watched argentina 's at times strong-armed win over mexico in sunday 's semi-final and insisted brazil were up for anything the argentines threw at them .
" brazil can not be intimidated .
we must concentrate on playing football because , although argentina has a very good team , brazil are not afraid of a tough match , " parreira said .
" because of the historical rivalry there are no friendly games between brazil and argentina . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's ronaldinho , right , and mexico 's zinha challenge for the ball during the confederations cup group b soccer match between brazil and mexico in hanover , northern germany , sunday , june 19 , 2005 .
-lrb- ap photo / martin meissner -rrb- ronaldinho , who burst onto the scene at the 1999 confed cup where brazil were stunned 4-3 in the final by mexico , concurred .
" we are eternal rivals so this is a final that motivates us a lot , " barcelona 's world footballer of the year said .
wednesday 's mouth-watering final offers brazil a chance for quick revenge after the 3-1 mauling by jose pekerman 's side in this month 's world cup qualifier .
brazil 's confed cup campaign started brightly against greece but then came that shock 1-0 defeat to mexico which meant a do-or-die clash in their final group game against japan .
goals from robinho and ronaldinho put them through as group b runners-up .
argentina , in contrast , sailed through the group stages , with wins against tunisia , australia and a draw with germany .
but the two time world cup winners almost came to grief in the semi-finals against mexico when only luciano figueroa 's 110th minute equalizer set up a penalty shoot-out where they prevailed 6-5 .

the selecao 's domination served notice as to who was the favorite come world cup time next year . two goals from adriano , pure magic by the brazilian midfield and solid work by the brazil defense sent the defending world champions the confederations cup glory on wednesday evening . the 4-1 victory over an unrecognizable argentina , showcased the very best in brazilian talent , with every one of their world class players notching a goal , and adriano getting two .
in mashing the opponents that had beaten them 3-1 in world cup qualifiers earlier in the month , brazil reaffirmed as favorites to win the big trophy when the world cup kicks off in germany next year . " i 'm happy and proud that everything worked out so well , " said adriano , who was voted player of the tournament .
" to win the cup ahead of the world cup was very important to us . " with stars to spare though playing without world class striker ronaldo , midfielder cafu and defender roberto carlos and stumbling -lrb- for them -rrb- through the tournament with a loss against mexico and a difficult win against japan , brazil was nothing but top form against their fiercest rivals . the selecao got going early in the match , making the most out of its few chances .
adriano showed again why he has been the most prolific goal-scorer in this tournament , unleashing a rocket in the 11th minute to give his side the lead .
as the argentine defense to contain him along the top of the penalty box , adriano powered his way laterally along the line and unleashed one of his trademark shots .
the ball not only seemed to break the sound barrier , but curled inward as well , making it impossible for a diving german lux to get a bead on . bildunterschrift : argentina 's goalkeeper german lux looks back at the ball in his net after brazil 's adriano , not in photo , scored the opening goal argentina seemed resolved to make good , charging down the field on the next possession and having a shot just knocked away by dida , who came almost to the penalty box to challenge the charging argentine striker . kaka , not argentina , next up in the 16th minute , midfielder juan roman riquelme tried a world class shot of his own and the ball curled just to the right of dida 's net .
a moment later , brazil answered out of nowhere . a long ball on the left side to robinho and the young sensation played it to kaka .
the boyish midfielder turned and , without hesitating , unleashed a straight shot to the upper right corner of the net which lux could not get a hold of . argentina appeared visibly shaken by brazil 's early lead .
though the gauchos had made good attempts in the brazil half of the field , they made nothing out of their chances .
brazil , with two real ones , made two goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's lucio , left , challenges argentina 's luciano figueroa .
brazil 's defense kept a tight lid on argentina ronaldinho puts nail in coffin the second half sprung wide open before it really began .
cicinho , who played a sensational match , crossed from the right side to ronaldinho , who took it at his middrift in traffic and directed it into lux 's net in the 46th minute . almost 15 minutes later , in the 63rd minute , adriano took another opportunity to prove why he was later voted mvp of the tournament .
cicinho was at work again , crossing beautifully from the right side .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.06.2005 confidence vote to be based on deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lonely schröder wants a new mandate for his reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder huddled with his ministers wednesday ahead of a vote this week that will set the wheels in motion for early elections expected to end his seven-year hold on power . sources said schröder told his cabinet he would justify his decision to call a no confidence vote in an address before parliament friday by saying that his government can not operate effectively , since it " lacks the ability to function " due to divisions within his party and a strong opposition . the chancellor stunned the country last month after suffering the latest in a string of state poll debacles by announcing he would seek national elections one year ahead of schedule to shore up his ailing government . his spokesman bela anda later denied the account of wednesday 's closed-door meeting , saying only that schröder made his decision based on whether " he could have constant faith in a parliamentary majority for his policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy . " britain supports a social europe , but it must be a social europe which is adapted to today 's world .
we have to understand why some european economies are creating jobs , and others are not , " blair said in a guest column for germany 's top selling newspaper , bild . failed alliance opinion makers have lamented the spectacular failure of the spd-greens alliance to tackle the country 's most pressing concerns and accused it of dithering , mismanagement and self-indulgence . " red-green , that alliance born in the world of visions , proved itself not to be ready for real life , " the influential newsweekly der spiegel wrote in a withering political obituary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " real reforms were promised but in the end it was again the same paper-shuffling that got the bureaucracy excited but contributed little to alleviating , let alone solving , the most urgent problems of our time . " the coalition swept to power in 1998 with a mandate for change after 16 years of conservative rule under helmut kohl , known as the chancellor of german unity . the youthful schröder , now 61 , and his vice-chancellor and foreign minister joschka fischer , now 57 and a veteran of the 1968 protest movement , pledged to set the country on a course for renewed prosperity . but even the latest reforms - including a labor market overhaul introduced in january - have failed to cut unemployment and are ripping new holes in the public purse . amid prevailing gloom in the economy , one bit of political news sparked a jump in this month 's main indicator of business sentiment : the prospect of early elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de road to early polls fraught with obstacles hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .

brazil coach carlos alberto parreira singled out juan roman riquelme and juan pablo sorin as argentina 's dangermen .
but he watched argentina 's at times strong-armed win over mexico in sunday 's semi-final and insisted brazil were up for anything the argentines threw at them .
" brazil can not be intimidated .
we must concentrate on playing football because , although argentina has a very good team , brazil are not afraid of a tough match , " parreira said .
" because of the historical rivalry there are no friendly games between brazil and argentina . "

wednesday 's mouth-watering final offers brazil a chance for quick revenge after the 3-1 mauling by jose pekerman 's side in this month 's world cup qualifier .
brazil 's confed cup campaign started brightly against greece but then came that shock 1-0 defeat to mexico which meant a do-or-die clash in their final group game against japan .
goals from robinho and ronaldinho put them through as group b runners-up .
argentina , in contrast , sailed through the group stages , with wins against tunisia , australia and a draw with germany .
but the two time world cup winners almost came to grief in the semi-finals against mexico when only luciano figueroa 's 110th minute equalizer set up a penalty shoot-out where they prevailed 6-5 .
" it 's going to be a great match , i 'm thrilled to have the chance to play in this " clasico " , said the villareal player who notched up a hat-trick against australia .

with brazil having beaten germany on saturday , argentina have had one day less to prepare for the final , and they also had to endure 30 minutes of stamina-sapping extra time in sunday 's semi-final , but pekerman shrugged off fatigue as a factor .
" my team are young and ambitious , we 'll be ready for brazil , " he said .
the countries have met 92 times before , with the score changing depending on which camp you talk to .

but he watched argentina 's at times strong-armed win over mexico in sunday 's semi-final and insisted brazil were up for anything the argentines threw at them .

" because of the historical rivalry there are no friendly games between brazil and argentina . "

argentina , in contrast , sailed through the group stages , with wins against tunisia , australia and a draw with germany .
but the two time world cup winners almost came to grief in the semi-finals against mexico when only luciano figueroa 's 110th minute equalizer set up a penalty shoot-out where they prevailed 6-5 .
" it 's going to be a great match , i 'm thrilled to have the chance to play in this " clasico " , said the villareal player who notched up a hat-trick against australia .

brazil and argentina may have stumbled along the way but they eventually lived up to their star billing by making it through to wednesday 's confederations cup final in frankfurt . this dream match-up between the south american soccer superpowers is seen by many as a potential dress rehearsal for the world cup final back in germany next year .
brazil coach carlos alberto parreira singled out juan roman riquelme and juan pablo sorin as argentina 's dangermen .
but he watched argentina 's at times strong-armed win over mexico in sunday 's semi-final and insisted brazil were up for anything the argentines threw at them .
" brazil can not be intimidated .
we must concentrate on playing football because , although argentina has a very good team , brazil are not afraid of a tough match , " parreira said .
" because of the historical rivalry there are no friendly games between brazil and argentina . "

" we are eternal rivals so this is a final that motivates us a lot , " barcelona 's world footballer of the year said .
wednesday 's mouth-watering final offers brazil a chance for quick revenge after the 3-1 mauling by jose pekerman 's side in this month 's world cup qualifier .
brazil 's confed cup campaign started brightly against greece but then came that shock 1-0 defeat to mexico which meant a do-or-die clash in their final group game against japan .
goals from robinho and ronaldinho put them through as group b runners-up .
argentina , in contrast , sailed through the group stages , with wins against tunisia , australia and a draw with germany .
but the two time world cup winners almost came to grief in the semi-finals against mexico when only luciano figueroa 's 110th minute equalizer set up a penalty shoot-out where they prevailed 6-5 .
" it 's going to be a great match , i 'm thrilled to have the chance to play in this " clasico " , said the villareal player who notched up a hat-trick against australia .

with brazil having beaten germany on saturday , argentina have had one day less to prepare for the final , and they also had to endure 30 minutes of stamina-sapping extra time in sunday 's semi-final , but pekerman shrugged off fatigue as a factor .
" my team are young and ambitious , we 'll be ready for brazil , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.06.2005 confidence vote to be based on deadlock großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lonely schröder wants a new mandate for his reforms german chancellor gerhard schröder huddled with his ministers wednesday ahead of a vote this week that will set the wheels in motion for early elections expected to end his seven-year hold on power . sources said schröder told his cabinet he would justify his decision to call a no confidence vote in an address before parliament friday by saying that his government can not operate effectively , since it " lacks the ability to function " due to divisions within his party and a strong opposition . the chancellor stunned the country last month after suffering the latest in a string of state poll debacles by announcing he would seek national elections one year ahead of schedule to shore up his ailing government . his spokesman bela anda later denied the account of wednesday 's closed-door meeting , saying only that schröder made his decision based on whether " he could have constant faith in a parliamentary majority for his policies . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor . " it is highly likely that red-green -lrb- the social-democrats and junior coalition partner , the greens -rrb- will lose , " said manfred güllner , head of the independent opinion research institute forsa , referring to the ruling coalition .
" if the election date had remained in 2006 , the government might have had the chance of seeing its -lrb- economic -rrb- reforms take effect so that voters could feel it .
they do n't have that chance any more . " it 's the economy , dummkopf ! germans are angry that schröder has failed to keep his seven-year-old promise to drive down unemployment and that they now in fact have more reason to fear for their jobs than at any other time since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , his reforms have not produced anything close to the robust recovery the country needs and the economy is still stagnant . british prime minister tony blair , locked in a dispute with schröder and french president jacques chirac over the eu budget , went as far last week as to offer up germany as an example of how not to manage a 21st century economy . " britain supports a social europe , but it must be a social europe which is adapted to today 's world .
we have to understand why some european economies are creating jobs , and others are not , " blair said in a guest column for germany 's top selling newspaper , bild . failed alliance opinion makers have lamented the spectacular failure of the spd-greens alliance to tackle the country 's most pressing concerns and accused it of dithering , mismanagement and self-indulgence . " red-green , that alliance born in the world of visions , proved itself not to be ready for real life , " the influential newsweekly der spiegel wrote in a withering political obituary . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " real reforms were promised but in the end it was again the same paper-shuffling that got the bureaucracy excited but contributed little to alleviating , let alone solving , the most urgent problems of our time . " the coalition swept to power in 1998 with a mandate for change after 16 years of conservative rule under helmut kohl , known as the chancellor of german unity . the youthful schröder , now 61 , and his vice-chancellor and foreign minister joschka fischer , now 57 and a veteran of the 1968 protest movement , pledged to set the country on a course for renewed prosperity . but even the latest reforms - including a labor market overhaul introduced in january - have failed to cut unemployment and are ripping new holes in the public purse . amid prevailing gloom in the economy , one bit of political news sparked a jump in this month 's main indicator of business sentiment : the prospect of early elections . afp / dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de road to early polls fraught with obstacles hungering for new elections , chancellor schröder has called for a vote of confidence this week .

with brazil and argentina in the final , this billing takes on almost prophetic proportions . brazil and argentina may have stumbled along the way but they eventually lived up to their star billing by making it through to wednesday 's confederations cup final . this dream match-up between the south american soccer superpowers is seen by many as a potential dress rehearsal for the world cup final when the biggest global soccer roadshow finally rolls into germany next year . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira , who singled out juan roman riquelme and juan pablo sorin as argentina 's danger men , acknowledged : " this final brings together the two favorites for the world cup . " brazil can not be intimidated , says coach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carlos alberto parreira he watched argentina 's at times strong-armed win over mexico in sunday 's semi-final and insisted brazil were up for anything the argentines threw at them .
" brazil can not be intimidated .
we must concentrate on playing football because , although argentina has a very good team , brazil are not afraid of a tough match . " " because of the historical rivalry there are no friendly games between brazil and argentina , " added parreira , in his third spell as the national coach . ronaldinho , who burst onto the scene at the 1999 confed cup where brazil were stunned 4-3 in the final by mexico , concurred : " we are eternal rivals so this is a final that motivates us a lot , " barcelona 's world footballer of the year said . opportunity to avenge buenos aires defeat wednesday 's cliffhanger offers brazil a chance for quick revenge after the world champion 's 3-1 mauling by jose pekerman 's side in this month 's world cup qualifier . brazil 's confed cup campaign started brightly against greece but then came that shock 1-0 defeat to mexico which meant a do-or-die clash in their final group game against japan .

but the two time world cup winners almost came to grief in the semi-finals against mexico when only luciano figueroa 's 110th minute equalizer set up a penalty shoot-out where they prevailed 6-5 . " it 's going to be a great match , i 'm thrilled to have the chance to play in this clásico " , said the villareal player who notched up a hat-trick against australia . no saviola but adriano will play argentina face the reigning world champions without striker javier saviola , suspended after being sent off against mexico .
the monaco player 's place is due to be filled by real zaragoza 's luciano galletti . brazil 's bull of an attacker adriano , scorer of two of the goals in the 3-2 semi-final win over germany , limped out of training monday but was later declared fit to take part . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : argentina 's juan roman riquelme -lrb- 8 -rrb- celebrates scoring his team 's second goal against brazil during their world cup qualifying soccer match at stadium monumental in buenos aires , argentina , wednesday , june 8 , 2005 .

" my team are young and ambitious , we 'll be ready for brazil . " the countries have met 92 times before , with the score changing depending on which camp you talk to .
brazil reckon it stands at 33 wins apiece with 26 draws , argentina disagree , claiming they hold the advantage with 37 wins against 33 defeats and 22 draws . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de argentina ready for " clásico " against brazil argentina turned in a less than flawless performance in sunday 's penalty shoot-out win over mexico but coach jose pekerman warned that the sparkle will return for the confederations cup final against brazil .

in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .

several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .

in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .

several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .

while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people .

this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.06.2005 eu sticks by plans for turkey talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take a while before turkey 's flag finds a place in brussels the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership . just as the eu 's enlargement chief , olli rehn , went before the press to talk about the intense debate over turkey 's possible eu membership , a storm broke out over brussels .
the satellite connections were cut , computer screens went dark for several minutes .
some took it as an omen .
but rehn reinforced the eu 's continuing support for negotiation talks with the vast , largely muslim country with the goal being accession , but not before 2014 . he said despite the turbulence the european bloc currently finds itself in after failed referendums on the eu constitution and financial squabbles , turkey should be given the chance to demonstrate that it can fulfil the obligations for membership , even if the road ahead is a long , meandering one , and membership is not guaranteed . presenting a roadmap-style plan for the talks , rehn also underlined that the vast mainly-muslim country faces a huge task of reform if it ever is to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " we stick to our word ... the negotiation process will encourage implementation of reforms and give a strong impulse to those who want more democracy and more human rights in this country , " he said . " it will certainly be a long and difficult journey , but the journey will be as important as the destination , " he added . differences of opinion ahead rehn was more than two hours late for the news conference announcing that the commission had adopted the draft mandate to start negotiations .
he told reporters : " we had a lengthy , argumentative and also very political debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus .
he called the negotiating framework " rigorous " and emphasized the demand that turkey improve relations with its neighbors , particularly cyprus , which has been divided since 1974 into greek and turkish cypriot communities , and armenia , with which it has no diplomatic relations and a sealed border . ankara is also under pressure to carry through on economic and political reforms as well as expand its customs union with the eu to include all ten new member states , including cyprus . cyprus , however , threatens to be a sticking point .
turkish officials are still talking about an additional declaration to the " ankara protocol " on customs union stating the document does not entail turkish recognition of cyprus . talks to start in october the 25-member bloc 's leaders agreed in december to start accession talks with ankara on october 3 provided the country meets a number of conditions , including signing an accord with the divided island of cyprus . on wednesday , the commission agreed on a proposed " framework for negotiations , " setting out its technical plans for how the talks should proceed . in any case the talks to join the eu - which underwent a " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 members last year , with a handful more waiting in line apart from turkey - are expected to last at least a decade . but the commission proposals reiterated terminology agreed by eu leaders in december , notably that the talks are " an open-ended process , the outcome of which can not be guaranteed beforehand . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul " if turkey will not be able to -lrb- join -rrb- we must ensure that she is fully anchored in the european structures , " said rehn , who forecast that talk of a " privileged partnership " with turkey rather than full eu membership will likely feature in the debate on the issue . and the eu 's constitution crisis has clouded the issue even further .
opposition to turkey 's eu hopes was seen as a key factor behind the " no " votes , and eu leaders have pledged to react by listening more to ordinary europeans . a " hold " on enlargement ? more fuel was adding to those burning issues on monday by interior minister and presidential hopeful nicolas sarkozy who called for eu enlargement to be put on hold to give time for its internal institutions to be " renovated . " " enlargement must be suspended at least as long as the institutions have not been renovated .
europe must have borders , " he said .
" not all countries have a vocation to be in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel during a visit to turkey in 2004 a growing number of center-right leaders in western europe , including the likely next german chancellor , angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , oppose turkish entry and favour the " privileged partnership " option . turkey has kept up pressure for the eu to stick by its commitments .
on the eve of the eu proposals , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called on the bloc to show that it is a not a " christian club " by admitting his country as a member . " if you really think the eu is not a christian club , you must arrange it so that turkey joins you , " he told a seminar tuesday night .

the satellite connections were cut , computer screens went dark for several minutes .
some took it as an omen .
but rehn reinforced the eu 's continuing support for negotiation talks with the vast , largely muslim country with the goal being accession , but not before 2014 . he said despite the turbulence the european bloc currently finds itself in after failed referendums on the eu constitution and financial squabbles , turkey should be given the chance to demonstrate that it can fulfil the obligations for membership , even if the road ahead is a long , meandering one , and membership is not guaranteed . presenting a roadmap-style plan for the talks , rehn also underlined that the vast mainly-muslim country faces a huge task of reform if it ever is to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " we stick to our word ... the negotiation process will encourage implementation of reforms and give a strong impulse to those who want more democracy and more human rights in this country , " he said .

he called the negotiating framework " rigorous " and emphasized the demand that turkey improve relations with its neighbors , particularly cyprus , which has been divided since 1974 into greek and turkish cypriot communities , and armenia , with which it has no diplomatic relations and a sealed border . ankara is also under pressure to carry through on economic and political reforms as well as expand its customs union with the eu to include all ten new member states , including cyprus . cyprus , however , threatens to be a sticking point .

opposition to turkey 's eu hopes was seen as a key factor behind the " no " votes , and eu leaders have pledged to react by listening more to ordinary europeans . a " hold " on enlargement ? more fuel was adding to those burning issues on monday by interior minister and presidential hopeful nicolas sarkozy who called for eu enlargement to be put on hold to give time for its internal institutions to be " renovated .

the satellite connections were cut , computer screens went dark for several minutes .
some took it as an omen .
but rehn reinforced the eu 's continuing support for negotiation talks with the vast , largely muslim country with the goal being accession , but not before 2014 . he said despite the turbulence the european bloc currently finds itself in after failed referendums on the eu constitution and financial squabbles , turkey should be given the chance to demonstrate that it can fulfil the obligations for membership , even if the road ahead is a long , meandering one , and membership is not guaranteed . presenting a roadmap-style plan for the talks , rehn also underlined that the vast mainly-muslim country faces a huge task of reform if it ever is to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " we stick to our word ... the negotiation process will encourage implementation of reforms and give a strong impulse to those who want more democracy and more human rights in this country , " he said . " it will certainly be a long and difficult journey , but the journey will be as important as the destination , " he added . differences of opinion ahead rehn was more than two hours late for the news conference announcing that the commission had adopted the draft mandate to start negotiations .
he told reporters : " we had a lengthy , argumentative and also very political debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus .
he called the negotiating framework " rigorous " and emphasized the demand that turkey improve relations with its neighbors , particularly cyprus , which has been divided since 1974 into greek and turkish cypriot communities , and armenia , with which it has no diplomatic relations and a sealed border . ankara is also under pressure to carry through on economic and political reforms as well as expand its customs union with the eu to include all ten new member states , including cyprus . cyprus , however , threatens to be a sticking point .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jürgen trittin a source told reuters that schröder himself would abstain in the vote , but he did not explicitly urge ministers to do the same .
after the meeting , environment minister jürgen trittin -lrb- photo -rrb- told der spiegel weekly that he would abstain from the vote and he assumed several other ministers would do the same . however , the leader of schröder 's social democrats , franz müntefering , has urged deputies from the spd and their junior partner , the greens , to back the measure to trigger early elections by abstaining . opposition to plan but the number of social democrat parliamentarians not willing to comply is climbing .
hans-peter kemper , regional spd chief in the state of north rhine-westphalia sees no point in pretending during the vote on friday that all of a sudden he mistrusts the chancellor . " on friday , i definitely will not abstain from voting .
i 'll give my support for chancellor schröder , although he does n't want it at this stage .
i 'm not willing to play stupid tactical games , " he said .
" our regional branch in north rhine-westphalia has always stood firmly behind the chancellor , so why should we pretend that 's different on friday ? "
another long-standing social democrat parliamentarian , rudolf bindig , says he 'd consider voting against the chancellor only if he did n't agree with his reform drive .
but the contrary is the case , he said . " we 've had our problems , but also achieved quite a lot in the interest of the country , " he said .
" we should aim to pursue this policy as long as we can , and early elections would severely jeopardize this objective . "
early vote if all goes as planned - which is still far from certain - president horst köhler will dissolve the parliament within 21 days and order new elections , probably on september 18 . schröder 's bid , which he has said is aimed at winning a fresh mandate for his reform drive after plumbing record depths for several months in the polls , is a typically bold move by a chancellor known for surprises . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , left , and cdu head angela merkel but analysts say schröder 's famous luck is running out and have widely tipped his conservative challenger , angela merkel , to trounce him and become germany 's first female chancellor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.06.2005 eu sticks by plans for turkey talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it will take a while before turkey 's flag finds a place in brussels the eu 's executive vowed wednesday to " stick to its word " to ankara and start entry talks in october despite the bloc 's current turmoil , while stressing there is no guarantee of eventual eu membership . just as the eu 's enlargement chief , olli rehn , went before the press to talk about the intense debate over turkey 's possible eu membership , a storm broke out over brussels .
the satellite connections were cut , computer screens went dark for several minutes .
some took it as an omen .
but rehn reinforced the eu 's continuing support for negotiation talks with the vast , largely muslim country with the goal being accession , but not before 2014 . he said despite the turbulence the european bloc currently finds itself in after failed referendums on the eu constitution and financial squabbles , turkey should be given the chance to demonstrate that it can fulfil the obligations for membership , even if the road ahead is a long , meandering one , and membership is not guaranteed . presenting a roadmap-style plan for the talks , rehn also underlined that the vast mainly-muslim country faces a huge task of reform if it ever is to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " we stick to our word ... the negotiation process will encourage implementation of reforms and give a strong impulse to those who want more democracy and more human rights in this country , " he said . " it will certainly be a long and difficult journey , but the journey will be as important as the destination , " he added . differences of opinion ahead rehn was more than two hours late for the news conference announcing that the commission had adopted the draft mandate to start negotiations .
he told reporters : " we had a lengthy , argumentative and also very political debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus .
he called the negotiating framework " rigorous " and emphasized the demand that turkey improve relations with its neighbors , particularly cyprus , which has been divided since 1974 into greek and turkish cypriot communities , and armenia , with which it has no diplomatic relations and a sealed border . ankara is also under pressure to carry through on economic and political reforms as well as expand its customs union with the eu to include all ten new member states , including cyprus . cyprus , however , threatens to be a sticking point .
turkish officials are still talking about an additional declaration to the " ankara protocol " on customs union stating the document does not entail turkish recognition of cyprus . talks to start in october the 25-member bloc 's leaders agreed in december to start accession talks with ankara on october 3 provided the country meets a number of conditions , including signing an accord with the divided island of cyprus . on wednesday , the commission agreed on a proposed " framework for negotiations , " setting out its technical plans for how the talks should proceed . in any case the talks to join the eu - which underwent a " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 members last year , with a handful more waiting in line apart from turkey - are expected to last at least a decade . but the commission proposals reiterated terminology agreed by eu leaders in december , notably that the talks are " an open-ended process , the outcome of which can not be guaranteed beforehand . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul " if turkey will not be able to -lrb- join -rrb- we must ensure that she is fully anchored in the european structures , " said rehn , who forecast that talk of a " privileged partnership " with turkey rather than full eu membership will likely feature in the debate on the issue . and the eu 's constitution crisis has clouded the issue even further .
opposition to turkey 's eu hopes was seen as a key factor behind the " no " votes , and eu leaders have pledged to react by listening more to ordinary europeans . a " hold " on enlargement ? more fuel was adding to those burning issues on monday by interior minister and presidential hopeful nicolas sarkozy who called for eu enlargement to be put on hold to give time for its internal institutions to be " renovated . " " enlargement must be suspended at least as long as the institutions have not been renovated .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2005 censoring german rap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin rapper sido is best known for his song about anal intercourse some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people . " we placed two aggro cds on our index at the end of may and there are several more we are processing , " petra meier , bpjm 's deputy head , told dw-world . the " index " is a list of media considered harmful or dangerous to minors .
this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .
indeed , the texts glorify sexual violence , drugs and the perverse degradation of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aggro label in berlin is home to many controversial rappers " the lyrics by certain german rappers , in particular those from the aggro label in berlin , are becoming increasingly more pornographic , racist and glorified violence , " monika griefahn , chairperson of the parliamentary committee on culture and the media , said in a statement earlier this month . this was also the case in the songs ' corresponding videos . " the misogynist and in part right-wing songs are full of violence and pornography , " griefahn said . listeners are responsible for their own actions despite official criticism , fans see aggro rappers as the german answer to us star 50 cent and his consorts .
according to the label , their bands are simply rapping about the social realities in the high-rise ghettos . " whether it 's financial problems , club nights , idol worship or anal intercourse , sido feeds from a tremendous diversity of topics , " aggro said on its web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushido 's album " carlo cokxxx nutten 2 " refers to women as " whores " bushido said he does n't feel personally responsible for the impact of his music . " if i listen to rammstein or eminem , i know that it 's just music and not my life , " bushido told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" it 's up to me to decide whether it influences my way of thinking . " censorship makes the music more attractive roland seim , a sociologist specializing in censorship , said that although prohibited things may not be particularly interesting , they become so through banning them . " this is especially the case in many youth cultures , which are supposed to be shielded from all sorts of influences , " seim wrote in a study .
" forbidden areas in particular appeal to them as minors , to find out something they 're actually not supposed to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial rappers say consumers have to make up their own minds for bushido , young people should be able to listen to his songs , but know where to draw the line . " i tell these kids : if you press play and listen to my cd , you get 70 minutes of my life , " bushido said .
" when you press stop , you 're back in your lives , with your parents , your teachers and the police , who 'll arrest you if you screw up . " freedom of expression needs limits griefahn said that radio stations and music television channels like viva and mtv also had to better exercise their obligation of control . " it just ca n't be that these stations neglect this critical responsibility , " griefahn said . " breaking taboos and portraying extremes are important stylistic devices of art , which rightly belong to the freedom of expression , " she said .
however , the protection of youth and the right of personal honor required clear restrictions . and , she added , this kind of rap shed a poor light on german music . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people . " we placed two aggro cds on our index at the end of may and there are several more we are processing , " petra meier , bpjm 's deputy head , told dw-world . the " index " is a list of media considered harmful or dangerous to minors .
this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .
indeed , the texts glorify sexual violence , drugs and the perverse degradation of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aggro label in berlin is home to many controversial rappers " the lyrics by certain german rappers , in particular those from the aggro label in berlin , are becoming increasingly more pornographic , racist and glorified violence , " monika griefahn , chairperson of the parliamentary committee on culture and the media , said in a statement earlier this month . this was also the case in the songs ' corresponding videos . " the misogynist and in part right-wing songs are full of violence and pornography , " griefahn said . listeners are responsible for their own actions despite official criticism , fans see aggro rappers as the german answer to us star 50 cent and his consorts .
according to the label , their bands are simply rapping about the social realities in the high-rise ghettos . " whether it 's financial problems , club nights , idol worship or anal intercourse , sido feeds from a tremendous diversity of topics , " aggro said on its web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushido 's album " carlo cokxxx nutten 2 " refers to women as " whores " bushido said he does n't feel personally responsible for the impact of his music .

the satellite connections were cut , computer screens went dark for several minutes .
some took it as an omen .
but rehn reinforced the eu 's continuing support for negotiation talks with the vast , largely muslim country with the goal being accession , but not before 2014 . he said despite the turbulence the european bloc currently finds itself in after failed referendums on the eu constitution and financial squabbles , turkey should be given the chance to demonstrate that it can fulfil the obligations for membership , even if the road ahead is a long , meandering one , and membership is not guaranteed . presenting a roadmap-style plan for the talks , rehn also underlined that the vast mainly-muslim country faces a huge task of reform if it ever is to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " we stick to our word ... the negotiation process will encourage implementation of reforms and give a strong impulse to those who want more democracy and more human rights in this country , " he said . " it will certainly be a long and difficult journey , but the journey will be as important as the destination , " he added . differences of opinion ahead rehn was more than two hours late for the news conference announcing that the commission had adopted the draft mandate to start negotiations .
he told reporters : " we had a lengthy , argumentative and also very political debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus .
he called the negotiating framework " rigorous " and emphasized the demand that turkey improve relations with its neighbors , particularly cyprus , which has been divided since 1974 into greek and turkish cypriot communities , and armenia , with which it has no diplomatic relations and a sealed border . ankara is also under pressure to carry through on economic and political reforms as well as expand its customs union with the eu to include all ten new member states , including cyprus . cyprus , however , threatens to be a sticking point .
turkish officials are still talking about an additional declaration to the " ankara protocol " on customs union stating the document does not entail turkish recognition of cyprus . talks to start in october the 25-member bloc 's leaders agreed in december to start accession talks with ankara on october 3 provided the country meets a number of conditions , including signing an accord with the divided island of cyprus . on wednesday , the commission agreed on a proposed " framework for negotiations , " setting out its technical plans for how the talks should proceed . in any case the talks to join the eu - which underwent a " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 members last year , with a handful more waiting in line apart from turkey - are expected to last at least a decade . but the commission proposals reiterated terminology agreed by eu leaders in december , notably that the talks are " an open-ended process , the outcome of which can not be guaranteed beforehand . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul " if turkey will not be able to -lrb- join -rrb- we must ensure that she is fully anchored in the european structures , " said rehn , who forecast that talk of a " privileged partnership " with turkey rather than full eu membership will likely feature in the debate on the issue . and the eu 's constitution crisis has clouded the issue even further .
opposition to turkey 's eu hopes was seen as a key factor behind the " no " votes , and eu leaders have pledged to react by listening more to ordinary europeans . a " hold " on enlargement ? more fuel was adding to those burning issues on monday by interior minister and presidential hopeful nicolas sarkozy who called for eu enlargement to be put on hold to give time for its internal institutions to be " renovated . " " enlargement must be suspended at least as long as the institutions have not been renovated .
europe must have borders , " he said .
" not all countries have a vocation to be in europe .

on the eve of the eu proposals , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called on the bloc to show that it is a not a " christian club " by admitting his country as a member . " if you really think the eu is not a christian club , you must arrange it so that turkey joins you , " he told a seminar tuesday night .
" we hope that the eu becomes a crossing point where civilizations can find one another , " he added . eu commission head jose manuel barroso , while insisting that talks are due to start in october , has also acknowledged that the eu needed to " discuss seriously " public concerns about the country 's possible membership . " it will be a complete mistake not to look at this issue seriously , " he said last week .

the satellite connections were cut , computer screens went dark for several minutes .
some took it as an omen .
but rehn reinforced the eu 's continuing support for negotiation talks with the vast , largely muslim country with the goal being accession , but not before 2014 . he said despite the turbulence the european bloc currently finds itself in after failed referendums on the eu constitution and financial squabbles , turkey should be given the chance to demonstrate that it can fulfil the obligations for membership , even if the road ahead is a long , meandering one , and membership is not guaranteed . presenting a roadmap-style plan for the talks , rehn also underlined that the vast mainly-muslim country faces a huge task of reform if it ever is to join the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olli rehn " we stick to our word ... the negotiation process will encourage implementation of reforms and give a strong impulse to those who want more democracy and more human rights in this country , " he said . " it will certainly be a long and difficult journey , but the journey will be as important as the destination , " he added . differences of opinion ahead rehn was more than two hours late for the news conference announcing that the commission had adopted the draft mandate to start negotiations .
he told reporters : " we had a lengthy , argumentative and also very political debate . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un soldiers , seen behind barbed wire and a eu flag , cross the ledra palace checkpoint in nicosia , cyprus .
he called the negotiating framework " rigorous " and emphasized the demand that turkey improve relations with its neighbors , particularly cyprus , which has been divided since 1974 into greek and turkish cypriot communities , and armenia , with which it has no diplomatic relations and a sealed border . ankara is also under pressure to carry through on economic and political reforms as well as expand its customs union with the eu to include all ten new member states , including cyprus . cyprus , however , threatens to be a sticking point .
turkish officials are still talking about an additional declaration to the " ankara protocol " on customs union stating the document does not entail turkish recognition of cyprus . talks to start in october the 25-member bloc 's leaders agreed in december to start accession talks with ankara on october 3 provided the country meets a number of conditions , including signing an accord with the divided island of cyprus . on wednesday , the commission agreed on a proposed " framework for negotiations , " setting out its technical plans for how the talks should proceed . in any case the talks to join the eu - which underwent a " big bang " expansion from 15 to 25 members last year , with a handful more waiting in line apart from turkey - are expected to last at least a decade . but the commission proposals reiterated terminology agreed by eu leaders in december , notably that the talks are " an open-ended process , the outcome of which can not be guaranteed beforehand . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : istanbul " if turkey will not be able to -lrb- join -rrb- we must ensure that she is fully anchored in the european structures , " said rehn , who forecast that talk of a " privileged partnership " with turkey rather than full eu membership will likely feature in the debate on the issue . and the eu 's constitution crisis has clouded the issue even further .
opposition to turkey 's eu hopes was seen as a key factor behind the " no " votes , and eu leaders have pledged to react by listening more to ordinary europeans . a " hold " on enlargement ? more fuel was adding to those burning issues on monday by interior minister and presidential hopeful nicolas sarkozy who called for eu enlargement to be put on hold to give time for its internal institutions to be " renovated . " " enlargement must be suspended at least as long as the institutions have not been renovated .
europe must have borders , " he said .
" not all countries have a vocation to be in europe . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel during a visit to turkey in 2004 a growing number of center-right leaders in western europe , including the likely next german chancellor , angela merkel -lrb- photo -rrb- , oppose turkish entry and favour the " privileged partnership " option . turkey has kept up pressure for the eu to stick by its commitments .
on the eve of the eu proposals , turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan called on the bloc to show that it is a not a " christian club " by admitting his country as a member . " if you really think the eu is not a christian club , you must arrange it so that turkey joins you , " he told a seminar tuesday night .
" we hope that the eu becomes a crossing point where civilizations can find one another , " he added . eu commission head jose manuel barroso , while insisting that talks are due to start in october , has also acknowledged that the eu needed to " discuss seriously " public concerns about the country 's possible membership .

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .
her liver and kidneys do not function properly .
she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .
unusual amounts of body hair began to grow and she put on muscle mass and height . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening of the 10th world youth games in east berlin , 1973 boese was experiencing what an estimated 10,000 athletes in the gdr did - the effects of performance-enhancing drugs on their bodies . these " supporting means , " as the east german language of bureaucracy and obfuscation termed the drugs , were produced by the pharmaceutical company jenapharm , headquartered in the town on jena . legal action but now some of these athletes , who like boese suffer from a variety of medical ailments resulting from the doping , are demanding compensation .
several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .
her liver and kidneys do not function properly .
she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .
unusual amounts of body hair began to grow and she put on muscle mass and height . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening of the 10th world youth games in east berlin , 1973 boese was experiencing what an estimated 10,000 athletes in the gdr did - the effects of performance-enhancing drugs on their bodies . these " supporting means , " as the east german language of bureaucracy and obfuscation termed the drugs , were produced by the pharmaceutical company jenapharm , headquartered in the town on jena . legal action but now some of these athletes , who like boese suffer from a variety of medical ailments resulting from the doping , are demanding compensation .
several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .

but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .
her liver and kidneys do not function properly .
she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .
unusual amounts of body hair began to grow and she put on muscle mass and height . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening of the 10th world youth games in east berlin , 1973 boese was experiencing what an estimated 10,000 athletes in the gdr did - the effects of performance-enhancing drugs on their bodies . these " supporting means , " as the east german language of bureaucracy and obfuscation termed the drugs , were produced by the pharmaceutical company jenapharm , headquartered in the town on jena . legal action but now some of these athletes , who like boese suffer from a variety of medical ailments resulting from the doping , are demanding compensation .
several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .
" you ca n't just go walking over bodies and abusing children to achieve your own political ends .
i ca n't understand that .

with brazil and argentina in the final , this billing takes on almost prophetic proportions . brazil and argentina may have stumbled along the way but they eventually lived up to their star billing by making it through to wednesday 's confederations cup final . this dream match-up between the south american soccer superpowers is seen by many as a potential dress rehearsal for the world cup final when the biggest global soccer roadshow finally rolls into germany next year . brazil coach carlos alberto parreira , who singled out juan roman riquelme and juan pablo sorin as argentina 's danger men , acknowledged : " this final brings together the two favorites for the world cup .

the drugs have scarred or even ruined their lives . sporting success in the former east germany was seen as much more than just a boost to national pride .
victory on the playing field was highly political .
medals and trophies gathered through sports were meant to demonstrate that the socialist system had better athletes , better training programs and better coaches – all in all , that it was simply better . but tell that to birgit boese -lrb- photo -rrb- , who is living proof of the terrible consequences of the german democratic republic 's -lrb- gdr -rrb- quest to achieve athletic glory at any cost .
at 43 years of age , the 6 ' 3 " -lrb- 190 cm -rrb- woman has to use a cane to get around her berlin apartment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : birgit boese she can not drive or use public transportation , since any kind of stress drives her blood pressure up to dangerous levels .
she has to take morphine two to three times daily due to chronic back pain , as well as insulin injections for her diabetes .
her liver and kidneys do not function properly .
she has asthma . " once a doctor told me , ms. boese , if you were a car and came in for inspection , i 'd write off the car as totaled and send it to the junkyard , " she said . olympian under construction but boese 's poor health is n't congenital .
in fact , at the age of ten , she began to be groomed to become an olympic champion for her country , east germany .
her sport was the shot put ; her training regimen at a special sports school , ten hours a day , six days a week .
every few days , starting when she was 11 years old , she and the other young athletes at the school were given blue pills they had to take .
at first , she and the others asked what they were . " ' do n't ask , just take it ' was the answer , " she said .
" later on , they said they were vitamins and minerals that we needed so we would n't get sick from all the hard training . " soon thereafter , however , she started noticing physical changes .
her voice got deeper and deeper , until when she answered the phone at home , relatives thought she was her brother .
unusual amounts of body hair began to grow and she put on muscle mass and height . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opening of the 10th world youth games in east berlin , 1973 boese was experiencing what an estimated 10,000 athletes in the gdr did - the effects of performance-enhancing drugs on their bodies . these " supporting means , " as the east german language of bureaucracy and obfuscation termed the drugs , were produced by the pharmaceutical company jenapharm , headquartered in the town on jena . legal action but now some of these athletes , who like boese suffer from a variety of medical ailments resulting from the doping , are demanding compensation .
several lawyers are planning lawsuits on behalf of more than 160 former athletes .
they are scheduled to begin this summer against the drug company , which is still in operation but is a subsidiary of drug giant schering . " we know at the moment that the east german government wanted to show that the gdr system was better through sports , and they thought to themselves , ' how can we have better athletes ? " ' said sven leistikow , a lawyer representing 16 former athletes .
" doping was the answer they came up with and we think jenapharm was a key player in this system . " bildunterschrift : jenapharm headquarters in jena , germany lawyer michael lehner is planning a lawsuit against jenapharm for 3.2 million euros -lrb- $ 5.83 million -rrb- on behalf of 160 doping victims .
he hopes to force the company to pay around 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 24,000 -rrb- per plaintiff and to cover their future medical costs .
former athletes often face high medical expenses to pay for medicines they need for pain relief or chronic diseases they have developed .
many have limited incomes because their medical conditions prevent them from holding down a job . who 's responsible ? the drug often given to athletes was oral-turinabol , a steroid jenapharm produced that was approved for some illness , but not meant for use on athletes for performance enhancement .
thus far , jenapharm has refused to discuss out-of-court settlements with the athletes .
the company has said it is not itself culpable , since the drug was legal in the gdr but misused by sports physicians and trainers . " i do understand the doping victims ' demand for compensation , " jenapharm general manager isabel rothe said in a statement to dw-world .
but said she added that claims against jenapharm are " not justified . " " what we consider to be most important is to identify those who were really responsible for the national gdr doping programme .
these were on the one hand the heads of the socialist party and the government … and on the other hand the sports physicians and trainers who used the doping substances on the athletes , " the statement said . but lawyers say files from the east german secret police , the stasi , show that jenapharm officials sat down on several occasions with government officials and trainers to discuss the doping program .
they also say the files show jenapharm passed on other , non-approved substances to trainers and withheld information about the side effects , which broke the law . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " if you are a drug producer , then you have to say no , " said attorney leistikow when responding to those who say the gdr was a totalitarian system and any company there was forced to do what the government decreed .
" they might have put pressure on people but i think there was no fear , no real danger for the managers of jenapharm if they did n't go along .
maybe there was a danger that they could lose their jobs , but that 's all . " this month , jenapharm announced it will provide 250,000 euros to fund a research team to investigate its own role in the gdr doping system .
critics call it another delaying tactic . cost of success while the olympic medal count for east germany was high - from 1972 to 1988 , the gdr won 384 medals - the human cost of those aspirations has turned out to be much higher .
the two million tablets given out per year during the 70s and 80s have wreaked physical and metal havoc on hundreds , if not thousands of lives . some cases have been fatal , such as that of athlete george severs , who was found at the bottom of a swimming pool having suffered heart failure .
his parents were told by gdr officials he drowned because the flu had made it weak .
two decades later it was revealed he died due to liver damage from the drugs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas krieger , formerly heidi krieger , champion gdr shot putter and doping victim heidi krieger , who was the european women 's champion shot putter in 1986 , was given oral-turinabol , which gave her masculine physical characteristics and heightened her confusion about an already uncertain sexual identity .
in 1997 , she underwent a sex-change operation , becoming andreas .
he now makes a living selling surplus us army clothing from a shop in magdeburg . many of the affected athletes feel justice has yet to be served .
while more than 300 former east german sporting officials have been convicted of doping offenses since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , those sentenced faced only fines and suspended jail sentences .
no one implicated has spent a day in jail . for birgit boese , the issue with jenapharm is not only one of justice , it 's also important to make the current lives of those impacted a little easier .
she does n't want to get rich , she said , but she wants recognition of the suffering she and others have endured .
she also wants the company to own up to its wrongs , even if it was then under pressure from a now-discredited system . " you hear the expression ‘ the ends justify the means , ' but not when you 're dealing with people , " she said .
" you ca n't just go walking over bodies and abusing children to achieve your own political ends .
i ca n't understand that .

but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

but so far , the promise has remained just that . the laustiz knew prosperity in the past , when the valuable brown coal buried beneath its sands was still a plentiful , valued commodity .
the mining industry took all it could , leaving much of the region resembling a lunar landscape of gaping , barren craters . bildunterschrift : now , the coal is gone , and the people have left .
industry stubbornly stayed away , that is , until the lausitz mining administration company -lrb- lmbv -rrb- , together with a conglomeration of investors , came up with a plan to bring the region back to life . perhaps they were inspired by the ground water .
for years , it was mercilessly pumped out of the coalminers ' way , but with the pumps stilled , it started to trickle back . now , the lmbv is literally bringing the water back in floods , turning the area into europe 's biggest artificial lake landscape , complete with yacht harbors , floating hotels , houseboats , a golf resort , speedboat recreation center and equestrian center . bildunterschrift : tourists are already enjoying the newly formed geierswalder lake over 20 lakes will result , with a canal to link up a chain of nine lakes - some of which are already taking shape - over 7,000 hectares . job creation " here you have space to moor boats , germany 's only continual seaplane landing area is here , and where else do you have a shipping canal linking up the lakes ? " ulrich stephan of the association overseeing the project told the bild newspaper . " the first investors are already committed .
over 800 jobs will be created here , " stephan added . the developers are hoping to attract a broad spectrum of visitors , including germany 's growing population segment of " young at heart " seniors interested in having an active holiday .
the wide array of water sports on offer is intended to draw a younger crowd . the new lake region is scheduled to be fully completed by 2018 , though that date has already been put in question because of the sheer quantity of water needed to flood an area that , over the years of coal-mining , became one of germany 's driest .
ground water is not enough to fill enormous craters left in the landscape - river water is also needed .
the flooding plan is already estimated to be two years behind schedule .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : flooding with ground water alone would make the lakes too acidic - experts are working on a solution . another problem - the water filling up the old mining pits is acidic , confronting scientists working on the project with the problem of how to neutralize it so that fish and vegetation can have a fighting chance . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing the tropics to germany long famous for its tasty cucumbers , the spreewald region just south of berlin is about to become well-known for rather more exotic flora : asian investors are converting a zeppelin hangar into a tropical rainforest .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 29.06.2005 censoring german rap großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin rapper sido is best known for his song about anal intercourse some german rappers have been making the headlines for their very politically incorrect lyrics .
the government 's media watchdog for youth has censored several cds , sparking a debate on just how far censorship should go . they sing about the ghettos of berlin , about drugs , sex and violence .
german rappers from the underground label aggro berlin like sido or bushido relay the realities of their neighborhoods . but while their lyrics may simply be a mirror of their lives , the german government 's federal department for media harmful to young persons -lrb- bpjm -rrb- considers these songs a threat to young people . " we placed two aggro cds on our index at the end of may and there are several more we are processing , " petra meier , bpjm 's deputy head , told dw-world . the " index " is a list of media considered harmful or dangerous to minors .
this is the case if they tend to " endanger their process of developing a socially responsible and self-reliant personality , " bpjm stated .
once a cd is on the index , it can no longer be sold to minors . " the majority of cds we are examining contain music with right wing extremist lyrics , but we are increasingly dealing with german rap music , too , " meier said . rappers more pornographic , racist and violent the bpjm ruled that the indexed songs significantly harmed women 's dignity and portrayed inhuman behavior .
indeed , the texts glorify sexual violence , drugs and the perverse degradation of women . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the aggro label in berlin is home to many controversial rappers " the lyrics by certain german rappers , in particular those from the aggro label in berlin , are becoming increasingly more pornographic , racist and glorified violence , " monika griefahn , chairperson of the parliamentary committee on culture and the media , said in a statement earlier this month . this was also the case in the songs ' corresponding videos . " the misogynist and in part right-wing songs are full of violence and pornography , " griefahn said . listeners are responsible for their own actions despite official criticism , fans see aggro rappers as the german answer to us star 50 cent and his consorts .
according to the label , their bands are simply rapping about the social realities in the high-rise ghettos . " whether it 's financial problems , club nights , idol worship or anal intercourse , sido feeds from a tremendous diversity of topics , " aggro said on its web site . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bushido 's album " carlo cokxxx nutten 2 " refers to women as " whores " bushido said he does n't feel personally responsible for the impact of his music . " if i listen to rammstein or eminem , i know that it 's just music and not my life , " bushido told the daily süddeutsche zeitung .
" it 's up to me to decide whether it influences my way of thinking . " censorship makes the music more attractive roland seim , a sociologist specializing in censorship , said that although prohibited things may not be particularly interesting , they become so through banning them . " this is especially the case in many youth cultures , which are supposed to be shielded from all sorts of influences , " seim wrote in a study .
" forbidden areas in particular appeal to them as minors , to find out something they 're actually not supposed to . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the controversial rappers say consumers have to make up their own minds for bushido , young people should be able to listen to his songs , but know where to draw the line . " i tell these kids : if you press play and listen to my cd , you get 70 minutes of my life , " bushido said .
" when you press stop , you 're back in your lives , with your parents , your teachers and the police , who 'll arrest you if you screw up . " freedom of expression needs limits griefahn said that radio stations and music television channels like viva and mtv also had to better exercise their obligation of control . " it just ca n't be that these stations neglect this critical responsibility , " griefahn said . " breaking taboos and portraying extremes are important stylistic devices of art , which rightly belong to the freedom of expression , " she said .
however , the protection of youth and the right of personal honor required clear restrictions . and , she added , this kind of rap shed a poor light on german music . sabina casagrande , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : sino-german pop walks on the wild side ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?

small shops , restaurants and ubiquitous adverts for mobile phone networks line the main street , while people bustle about making ends meet .
it all looks ordinary and typically african - until you look into the distance and realise that at the end of the main street is an enormous modern building that completely dominates the vista .
it is a south african-owned supermarket , and , the size of an aircraft hangar , it completely dwarves everything around it .
while staying in the capital lusaka i had got used to the sight of south african-owned shopping malls .
together with the cleanly-swept streets , they gave lusaka - a city that must surely be one of the cleanest capitals in africa - an impression of modernity and progress .
however , that was the capital .
i was surprised to see that south africans had begun to dominate the rural retail trade even here mazabuka .
investment it is an indication of how deep the influence of liberalisation has reached in zambia , a country that has undergone an eastern-european style transformation to free market ideals .
the reforms began in 1991 , when former president frederick chiluba swept ' father of the nation ' kenneth kaunda out of power and started turning his " humanist " - read , broadly , socialist - policies on their heads .
the impact of those reforms is still being felt , and since president chiluba was levered out of power in 2001 under a cloud of corruption charges - some relating to the mass privatisations that followed his arrival in power - zambians have been debating the pros and cons of the free market .
pre-chiluba , the zambian government owned about 300 large and smaller scale enterprises , from huge copper mines to agricultural cooperatives , and even butcher 's shops .
" these companies were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year , " an international banker in lusaka told bbc world service 's assignment programme .
" they had to go - it was either privatise or see them all collapse completely . "
all but a handful of these firms have now been privatised and , in the wave of liberalisation , many import tariffs which used to protect zambian industry from outside competition have also been swept away .
the result has been some inward investment - such as the south african supermarkets - but also complaints about widespread unemployment .
cheap imports for example , the indigenous textile industry has collapsed under the weight of cheap imports from asia and the trade in second-hand clothes from europe .
i met british-born textile entrepreneur chris glover at his factory in livingstone , southern zambia , while ancient shuttle-and-loom weaving machines created an infernal din turning out acrylic blankets .
much of zambia 's formerly state-owned industry is now privatised glover agreed , over the racket , that his was a dying industry - " unless the government can protect it from cheap imports " .
however , since many of the imports come from china - which supplies considerable aid to the zambian government in other spheres - a crackdown on the imports is difficult to imagine .
" it 's unlikely , " mr glover agreed .
" the chinese are doing good work for zambia on the roads and airports . "
zambian trade unionist joyce nonde has seen membership of her financial-sector union fall from 12,000 to just 3,000 .
she accepts that some privatisations were inevitable , but said , " there was also asset stripping and political interference by the government of the day " .
by " interference , " ms nonde explained , she meant corruption .
the international banker , who requested anonymity , agreed with ms nonde , saying that there was a " lack of transparency under chiluba " - who was replaced by levy mwanawasa .
ms nonde is now fighting against the privatisation of one of the last national banks to remain in government hands .
she argues that without government control of parts of the financial sector rural areas will end up without any access to the money markets .
unemployment everyone i spoke to in zambia said unemployment had increased as a result of liberalisation and privatisation measures introduced after 1991 .
" prospects are bleak , " said a woman student wearing a graduation gown as she headed for the lawns of the university of zambia .
" there are hardly any jobs .
it 's all those privatisations . "
but the international banker , who saw the liberalisation measures as " inevitable and unavoidable , " said zambia 's economic problems pre-dated 1991 .
former president frederick chiluba began the reform process " there was a sharp decline in average per capita income from the 1980s onwards - from $ 900 to $ 300 , " he said .
" but at least for the past few years the decline has been stopped and now economic growth is beginning to kick in , despite the current drought . "
while life is hard for the urban unemployed here , it is arguably even worse for small-scale farmers who make up the majority of zambians .
maize is the staple food of the country - it is pounded to make a tasty porridge , nshima - and until 1991 farmers were subsidised to produce it , ensuring a steady supply to the towns and cities .
those subsidies - on fertilizers and other inputs , as well as guaranteed cheap loans - made farmers relatively well off .
all that has now changed , however , and the subsidies have been cut .
when i visited a small farming community outside the town of choma there were heartfelt complaints about the lack of water caused by the current drought , but also about the lack of investment in rural areas .
the farmers i met showed me numerous deep wells they had tried to dig .
most of them had yielded nothing and the farmers were relying on little more than dirty holes in the ground from which brackish liquid occasionally seeped for drinking water and to irrigate their crops .
a full report on zambia 's liberalisation will be broadcast on bbc world service 's assignment programme on 7 july at 0805 gmt .

small shops , restaurants and ubiquitous adverts for mobile phone networks line the main street , while people bustle about making ends meet .
it all looks ordinary and typically african - until you look into the distance and realise that at the end of the main street is an enormous modern building that completely dominates the vista .
it is a south african-owned supermarket , and , the size of an aircraft hangar , it completely dwarves everything around it .
while staying in the capital lusaka i had got used to the sight of south african-owned shopping malls .
together with the cleanly-swept streets , they gave lusaka - a city that must surely be one of the cleanest capitals in africa - an impression of modernity and progress .
however , that was the capital .
i was surprised to see that south africans had begun to dominate the rural retail trade even here mazabuka .
investment it is an indication of how deep the influence of liberalisation has reached in zambia , a country that has undergone an eastern-european style transformation to free market ideals .
the reforms began in 1991 , when former president frederick chiluba swept ' father of the nation ' kenneth kaunda out of power and started turning his " humanist " - read , broadly , socialist - policies on their heads .
the impact of those reforms is still being felt , and since president chiluba was levered out of power in 2001 under a cloud of corruption charges - some relating to the mass privatisations that followed his arrival in power - zambians have been debating the pros and cons of the free market .
pre-chiluba , the zambian government owned about 300 large and smaller scale enterprises , from huge copper mines to agricultural cooperatives , and even butcher 's shops .
" these companies were losing hundreds of millions of dollars a year , " an international banker in lusaka told bbc world service 's assignment programme .
" they had to go - it was either privatise or see them all collapse completely . "
all but a handful of these firms have now been privatised and , in the wave of liberalisation , many import tariffs which used to protect zambian industry from outside competition have also been swept away .
the result has been some inward investment - such as the south african supermarkets - but also complaints about widespread unemployment .
cheap imports for example , the indigenous textile industry has collapsed under the weight of cheap imports from asia and the trade in second-hand clothes from europe .
i met british-born textile entrepreneur chris glover at his factory in livingstone , southern zambia , while ancient shuttle-and-loom weaving machines created an infernal din turning out acrylic blankets .
much of zambia 's formerly state-owned industry is now privatised glover agreed , over the racket , that his was a dying industry - " unless the government can protect it from cheap imports " .
however , since many of the imports come from china - which supplies considerable aid to the zambian government in other spheres - a crackdown on the imports is difficult to imagine .
" it 's unlikely , " mr glover agreed .
" the chinese are doing good work for zambia on the roads and airports . "
zambian trade unionist joyce nonde has seen membership of her financial-sector union fall from 12,000 to just 3,000 .
she accepts that some privatisations were inevitable , but said , " there was also asset stripping and political interference by the government of the day " .
by " interference , " ms nonde explained , she meant corruption .
the international banker , who requested anonymity , agreed with ms nonde , saying that there was a " lack of transparency under chiluba " - who was replaced by levy mwanawasa .
ms nonde is now fighting against the privatisation of one of the last national banks to remain in government hands .
she argues that without government control of parts of the financial sector rural areas will end up without any access to the money markets .
unemployment everyone i spoke to in zambia said unemployment had increased as a result of liberalisation and privatisation measures introduced after 1991 .
" prospects are bleak , " said a woman student wearing a graduation gown as she headed for the lawns of the university of zambia .
" there are hardly any jobs .
it 's all those privatisations . "
but the international banker , who saw the liberalisation measures as " inevitable and unavoidable , " said zambia 's economic problems pre-dated 1991 .
former president frederick chiluba began the reform process " there was a sharp decline in average per capita income from the 1980s onwards - from $ 900 to $ 300 , " he said .
" but at least for the past few years the decline has been stopped and now economic growth is beginning to kick in , despite the current drought . "
while life is hard for the urban unemployed here , it is arguably even worse for small-scale farmers who make up the majority of zambians .
maize is the staple food of the country - it is pounded to make a tasty porridge , nshima - and until 1991 farmers were subsidised to produce it , ensuring a steady supply to the towns and cities .
those subsidies - on fertilizers and other inputs , as well as guaranteed cheap loans - made farmers relatively well off .
all that has now changed , however , and the subsidies have been cut .
when i visited a small farming community outside the town of choma there were heartfelt complaints about the lack of water caused by the current drought , but also about the lack of investment in rural areas .
the farmers i met showed me numerous deep wells they had tried to dig .
most of them had yielded nothing and the farmers were relying on little more than dirty holes in the ground from which brackish liquid occasionally seeped for drinking water and to irrigate their crops .
a full report on zambia 's liberalisation will be broadcast on bbc world service 's assignment programme on 7 july at 0805 gmt .

dave fellows has spent the past few years on the uk 's stand-up circuit , but will return to acting for the role .
he had worn a beard for 20 years to avoid comparisons with thomas but he has shaved for an ugly , lovely , night .
it explores a relationship between an american student visiting the city and the ghost of thomas , who died in 1953 .
fellows , 45 , of briton ferry , just outside swansea , said he had been a great fan of thomas ' work in his youth .
" it is something that has stayed with me , " he said .
" i have had a beard for 20 years because who wants to look like thomas ?
great man that he was he was no male model .
" i 'm looking forward to it very much .
i 'm getting a bit old for stand-up , which is for younger men , so i 'm going back into acting and writing . "
swansea playwright binda singh adapted the screenplay from his own play about a student who travels to the city in search of answers to a family riddle .
it is being directed and produced by former disney man brian thomas .
" it 's a privately funded film which is being made for television primarily for the united states , " he said .
" it 's the story of a student whose father was born in swansea and emigrated to the united states .
" he is very much influenced by his father and his father 's love of south wales , and his almost obsessional love for dylan thomas and his work .
" we are filming on both sides of the atlantic , in texas at austin university which has the largest collections of dylan thomas ' writings in the world and then in swansea .
" the backdrop is swansea university but we will also be using the seafront and cwmdonkin -lrb- where thomas grew up -rrb- . "

this " justice by postcode " scenario has proved to be of such concern to the metropolitan police that a review has been launched to examine the factors behind such varying clear-up rates .
overall , figures show one in five reported rapes in london leads to a caution or charge , but the met is keeping quiet on which boroughs are getting good results and which are falling behind .
the review , to be published by the end of july , also comes against a backdrop of falling rape conviction rates in the city . "
it is about how we can find out what they do well so standards are consistent across london " det ch insp dave osborn det ch insp dave osborn , who is working on the inquiry , said : " this review is not about the met failing in rape -lrb- investigations -rrb- but about looking at good practice and making sure we are not complacent . "
the met 's work on rape breaks down into three strands - investigation , victim care and cold case reviews of historic cases .
the review will focus on the investigation side and a look at what has allowed some boroughs to excel , said det ch insp osborn .
" it is about how we can find out what they do well so standards are consistent across london , " he said . "
more women are reporting rape because there is more rape " sandra mcneill , truth about rape in 2001 , the met launched project sapphire , billed as the most comprehensive reform programme on rape investigation ever undertaken by the service .
the project , which ran across all london boroughs , aimed to increase the met 's professionalism in the treatment of victims and the way rape allegations were investigated .
sapphire also aimed to build public confidence in the police 's handling of such crimes .
its success , say police , has resulted in more people coming forward .
' lost evidence ' sandra mcneill , from campaign group truth about rape group , welcomed the inquiry but was less convinced about its success .
" i get fed up with police saying that the number of rapes being reported is going up but not the number of rapes .
more women are reporting rape because there is more rape . "
" they rely too heavily on dna .
police should be detectives .
if she -lsb- the victim -rsb- said she screamed , why not ask the neighbours ? " she said .
" in one case from london , officers said they had lost the evidence , which shows they just do n't take it as seriously as they should . "
" victims of rape drop out at all stages because they are not being respected , supported or believed " sandra mcneill , truth about rape but det ch insp osborn said : " we take rape very , very seriously .
it 's one of our core objectives .
" if one recognises that the vast majority of rape cases are committed by people known to each other , the issue is now over consent and how it 's defined .
" dna is , of course , important but it is used in a minority of cases . "
he said teams of detectives made door-to-door inquiries , looked at cctv and took witness statements .
safe havens ms mcneill also said she was not convinced about standards of care .
" victims of rape drop out at all stages because they are not being respected , supported or believed - it 's very hard and humiliating .
" we know very few women lie about rape .
they need to be given support so they do n't withdraw at the first possible opportunity . "
det ch insp osborn said london 's three one-stop shop facilities called havens in camberwell , paddington and whitechapel offered a high standard of victim care .
unsolved rapes the £ 1m-a-year units are recognised as world leaders in first class forensic gathering and evidence retrieval .
victims who can self-refer or be referred by the police , are allocated a chaperone to support them through medical examinations -lrb- all conducted by females -rrb- to the conclusion of an investigation .
the met 's cold-case team , meanwhile , has been revisiting unsolved rape crimes from 1987 to 1995 .
at the time , police had been unable to get forensic leads but advances in technology has now made new leads possible . "
this is not in itself going to turn around a falling conviction rate - it would contribute but it wo n't be the only answer " det ch insp dave osborn essentially what det ch insp osborn wants is for its investigation strand to match the acclaimed victim care .
but he warned : " this is not in itself going to turn around a falling conviction rate - it would contribute but it wo n't be the only answer . "
" it 's much wider than policing investigation .
" it 's about judges , juries , the crown prosecution service , interpretation of the law and what rape is - as it 's no longer the classic definition of stranger rape . "

douglas havard , from dallas , texas , made fake credit cards with stolen bank details as part of a global syndicate .
the scam relied on phishing - by which online account holders are induced to give away their personal details .
havard admitted conspiracy to defraud and conspiracy to launder money .
his co-accused lee elwood was jailed for four years for the same offences .
over £ 700,000 is known to have been stolen by leeds-based havard , but the real figure is thought to be far more .
havard , whose arrest followed an investigation involving the us secret service and the fbi , was sentenced at leeds crown court .
elwood , 25 , of royal exchange court , glasgow , pleaded guilty to the same offences on 4 june .
identity theft the case was part of an investigation by the national hi-tech crime unit -lrb- nhtcu -rrb- into eastern european crime syndicates that target uk banks and their customers .
the court heard how havard , from holbeck , near leeds , was supplied with stolen bank details by russian computer hackers .
he then encoded the details onto the magnetic strips of the counterfeit cards which were used at cashpoints in britain and the us and to buy and sell items online .
after his arrest in june 2003 , police searched havard 's flats in leeds and manchester and found false passports and driving licenses , blank cashcards and the equipment used to make the counterfeits . "
we hope that these sentences deliver a tough message to anybody either thinking about or actually using other people 's identities to steal " det supt mick deats nhtcu during sentencing , judge wolstenholme said that without the interception of the authorities he had no doubt the fraud would have continued on an enormous scale .
detective superintendent mick deats , deputy head of the nhtcu , said : " internet fraud is on the increase and we work with our colleagues in law enforcement across the globe to stamp down on those criminals using other people 's identities to steal .
" we hope that these sentences deliver a tough message to anybody either thinking about or actually using other people 's identities to steal . "
havard is wanted by the us police for separate offences and extradition proceedings are under way .
