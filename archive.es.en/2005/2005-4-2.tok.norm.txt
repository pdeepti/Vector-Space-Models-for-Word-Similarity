to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .

he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .

afterwards , he plans to appear in tv ads to explain the constitution to french voters and its importance . at the same time the energetic head of chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , nicolas sarkozy , appeared on the television talk show " 100 minutes to convince , " where he pushed the merits of the constitution in a heated discussion with one of its leading opponents . " i will engage all my energies to tell the french one thing : the rules that europe operates under have to change , " sarkozy said on tv as reported by afp .
" there is not one element in the constitution - not a single one - that will make the situation worse .
on the contrary there are many that will make things better . " left making trouble meanwhile francois bayrou , president of the ump 's coalition partner the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , held his first public meeting outside the northern city of lille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority skeptical and on the political left ps leader francois hollande , who is opposed on the constitution issue by about half of his own party 's rank-and-file , appeared at a campaign rally in the southern city of marseille . " it will be a chance to say yes to the yes and no to the no - because we are well aware that a ' no ' in france would be the end of political europe , " hollande told afp . afraid of losing jobs supporters of the eu 's constitution have watched in horror over the past two weeks as five successive opinion polls have put the " no " campaign for the may 29 referendum in the lead with between 51 and 55 percent of the vote . the growth of the " no " camp has been strongest on the political left , fed by a wave of social discontent as voters increasingly identify the eu with their most pressing concerns : 10 percent unemployment , stagnant wage packets and the flight of jobs to low-protection economies in the east . debating with sarkozy , a leading socialist opponent on the constitution , henri emmanuelli , said it was a " liberal " treaty which would bind all future european governments into following free-market economics . sarkozy retorted that it was the first european text in 50 years to contain - in the charter of fundamental rights - a " social ambition . " " all the trade unions in europe are calling for a vote in favour ...
are all europe 's trade unionists , are all the european socialist parties wrong . " the constitution is meant to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc by creating posts of president and foreign minister and adapting voting procedures .
however , it must first be approved by all 25 members , and a rejection in so large a country as france would be an unprecedented setback . chirac 's ruling center-right ump and its centrist ally the udf are both enthusiastic supporters of the text , as is ps leader hollande and other socialist heavyweights such as former ministers dominique strauss-kahn and jack lang . but the opposition now embraces a wide coalition including the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , traditionalist anti-europeans such as philippe de villier 's movement for france , the far-left trotskyites and communists and the left-wing of the ps . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french corruption erodes trust in politics the latest corruption trial of the french president 's cronies leaves the public shaking their heads , yet again .

it is not only catholics all around the world who have been praying for the pope , " the daily rzeczpospolita said , carrying photos of the faithful in new york , calcutta and across poland on its front page . the bridging of differing faiths by 84-year-old pontiff was praised by the daily le matin , of morocco , where the pope visited in 1985 .
" he spoke words of hope and friendship and gave a concrete sense to the reconciliation between islam and the -lrb- catholic -rrb- church , " the newspaper said . " the pope has taught us how to die " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john paul ii 's courage in the face of death was highlighted by the british conservative newspaper the daily telegraph .
the pope " has used the most powerful imagery - that of a dying man - to bear witness to the life and death of christ , " said the telegraph , which concluded " the pope has taught us all how to die . " this theme was also used in the german press , with the conservative daily die welt saying the pope has " provided a more profound image of man " beyond strength and good health , an " affirmation for people who are sick , weak and old . " the pontiff shows publicly that " suffering is part of life , " write the the süddeutsche zeitung daily . pope john paul ii was described as " the most important pope since saint peter " under the headline of " pope of popes " by british conservative daily the times , which also emphasized his role in taking " rome to the world .

" the british tabloid the sun noted the pope 's " pivotal role in the defeat of communism and the fall of the berlin wall . "
this aspect was also reported by russian newspapers .
" the pope played more than a small part in the collapse of the socialist system , " wrote the opposition newspaper kommersant .
" the 1981 attempt on his life , behind which , according to western experts , stands the kgb , is linked to precisely this aspect of his activities , " kommersant added . but the official government daily rossiiskaya gazeta also noted the close , personal relationship that existed between former russian president boris yeltsin and his successor vladimir putin and the pontiff . the pope 's activities had resulted in a " so far unseen opening of the catholic church towards events in the modern world , " according to the croatian newspaper novi list . italian press bid a fond farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy , home to the vatican , had the most personal tribute to the pope .
" the long adieu to the dying pope , " headlined the rome 's daily la repubblica , as corriere della sera spoke of " the embrace of the dying pope . " " the love of rome accompanies the pope , " assured the cronaca di roma .

afterwards , he plans to appear in tv ads to explain the constitution to french voters and its importance . at the same time the energetic head of chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , nicolas sarkozy , appeared on the television talk show " 100 minutes to convince , " where he pushed the merits of the constitution in a heated discussion with one of its leading opponents . " i will engage all my energies to tell the french one thing : the rules that europe operates under have to change , " sarkozy said on tv as reported by afp .
" there is not one element in the constitution - not a single one - that will make the situation worse .
on the contrary there are many that will make things better . " left making trouble meanwhile francois bayrou , president of the ump 's coalition partner the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , held his first public meeting outside the northern city of lille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority skeptical and on the political left ps leader francois hollande , who is opposed on the constitution issue by about half of his own party 's rank-and-file , appeared at a campaign rally in the southern city of marseille . " it will be a chance to say yes to the yes and no to the no - because we are well aware that a ' no ' in france would be the end of political europe , " hollande told afp . afraid of losing jobs supporters of the eu 's constitution have watched in horror over the past two weeks as five successive opinion polls have put the " no " campaign for the may 29 referendum in the lead with between 51 and 55 percent of the vote . the growth of the " no " camp has been strongest on the political left , fed by a wave of social discontent as voters increasingly identify the eu with their most pressing concerns : 10 percent unemployment , stagnant wage packets and the flight of jobs to low-protection economies in the east . debating with sarkozy , a leading socialist opponent on the constitution , henri emmanuelli , said it was a " liberal " treaty which would bind all future european governments into following free-market economics . sarkozy retorted that it was the first european text in 50 years to contain - in the charter of fundamental rights - a " social ambition . " " all the trade unions in europe are calling for a vote in favour ...
are all europe 's trade unionists , are all the european socialist parties wrong . " the constitution is meant to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc by creating posts of president and foreign minister and adapting voting procedures .
however , it must first be approved by all 25 members , and a rejection in so large a country as france would be an unprecedented setback . chirac 's ruling center-right ump and its centrist ally the udf are both enthusiastic supporters of the text , as is ps leader hollande and other socialist heavyweights such as former ministers dominique strauss-kahn and jack lang . but the opposition now embraces a wide coalition including the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , traditionalist anti-europeans such as philippe de villier 's movement for france , the far-left trotskyites and communists and the left-wing of the ps . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french corruption erodes trust in politics the latest corruption trial of the french president 's cronies leaves the public shaking their heads , yet again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.04.2005 daimlerchrysler recalls 1.3 million mercedes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimlerchrysler claims the mercedes recall is a push for quality daimerchrysler has recalled more than a million cars in its largest recall ever . the german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler is recalling 1.3 million mercedes cars built after june 2001 as part of what it says is a quality improvement offensive in its luxury cars division . in a statement issued thursday , company officials said that it wanted to update the braking systems on e-class , sl-class and cls-class cars built since that date .
the company also wants to check and possibly replace the voltage regulator in alternators in six and eight cylinder vehicles built between june 2001 and november 2004 .
company officials also want to update battery unit software in its e-class and cls-class models made from january 2002 to january this year .
it is the company 's biggest recall to date , one that is not motivated by car safety concerns . quality improvement will affect profits company officials have already said that the push to improve product quality would decrease profits .
" we are now producing the best product quality ever and our aim is to ensure that those vehicles in the hands of customers which are the cause of complaints achieve a standard of quality that reflects our highest expectations , " mercedes chief eckhard cordes said in a statement to reuters .
daimlerchrysler officials declined to tally the exact cost of the recall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of quality ? shares dip georg stuerzer , an analyst at hvb group in munich told reuters that costs could run as high as hundreds of millions of euros .
" on this kind of scale i expect the cost to run into the three-digit million-euro range , " he told the news agency .
" the quality campaign will weigh further on the company 's first quarter . " shares in daimlerchrysler dipped after news of the recall .
mercedes has traditionally been daimler 's most lucrative business , but has had a bumpy ride in recent quarters .
mercedes ' profits , which slid from 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.8 million -rrb- in the last quarter of 2004 , have been affected by strong competition , losses by its smart car brand , a strong euro as a result of the drop of the us dollar , the cost of launching new models and increased spending to fix quality problems . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors probe daimlerchrysler prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .

afterwards , he plans to appear in tv ads to explain the constitution to french voters and its importance . at the same time the energetic head of chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , nicolas sarkozy , appeared on the television talk show " 100 minutes to convince , " where he pushed the merits of the constitution in a heated discussion with one of its leading opponents . " i will engage all my energies to tell the french one thing : the rules that europe operates under have to change , " sarkozy said on tv as reported by afp .
" there is not one element in the constitution - not a single one - that will make the situation worse .
on the contrary there are many that will make things better . " left making trouble meanwhile francois bayrou , president of the ump 's coalition partner the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , held his first public meeting outside the northern city of lille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority skeptical and on the political left ps leader francois hollande , who is opposed on the constitution issue by about half of his own party 's rank-and-file , appeared at a campaign rally in the southern city of marseille . " it will be a chance to say yes to the yes and no to the no - because we are well aware that a ' no ' in france would be the end of political europe , " hollande told afp . afraid of losing jobs supporters of the eu 's constitution have watched in horror over the past two weeks as five successive opinion polls have put the " no " campaign for the may 29 referendum in the lead with between 51 and 55 percent of the vote . the growth of the " no " camp has been strongest on the political left , fed by a wave of social discontent as voters increasingly identify the eu with their most pressing concerns : 10 percent unemployment , stagnant wage packets and the flight of jobs to low-protection economies in the east . debating with sarkozy , a leading socialist opponent on the constitution , henri emmanuelli , said it was a " liberal " treaty which would bind all future european governments into following free-market economics . sarkozy retorted that it was the first european text in 50 years to contain - in the charter of fundamental rights - a " social ambition . " " all the trade unions in europe are calling for a vote in favour ...
are all europe 's trade unionists , are all the european socialist parties wrong . " the constitution is meant to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc by creating posts of president and foreign minister and adapting voting procedures .
however , it must first be approved by all 25 members , and a rejection in so large a country as france would be an unprecedented setback . chirac 's ruling center-right ump and its centrist ally the udf are both enthusiastic supporters of the text , as is ps leader hollande and other socialist heavyweights such as former ministers dominique strauss-kahn and jack lang . but the opposition now embraces a wide coalition including the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , traditionalist anti-europeans such as philippe de villier 's movement for france , the far-left trotskyites and communists and the left-wing of the ps . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french corruption erodes trust in politics the latest corruption trial of the french president 's cronies leaves the public shaking their heads , yet again .

in europe , his name will be inextricably tied to the fall of communism in eastern europe . for europe 's smallest state , vatican city , oct.16 , 1978 was an important day .
on st. peter 's square , a new pope was proclaimed , karol wojtyla , the archbishop of cracow .
it was the first time in more than 400 years that a non-italian had taken over the leadership of the catholic church . " have no fear , open the doors for christ , yes , tear them open for him ! "
john paul ii said in his first sermon as the bishop of rome . the catholic church in poland had given impetus to the election of karol wojtyla as pope , but the community party central committee in warsaw was worried .
at his first mass as pope on victory square in warsaw in july 1979 , john paul ii delivered a political message , which he cleverly disguised . " do not be afraid .
the holy ghost will descend and renew the countenance of this earth .
this polish earth , " he said . stimulus for change it was a masked call to revolt against repression and inhumanity and the papal trip developed into a political demonstration .
just a year later , the fruits of that trip were evident - in 1980 , the solidarity movement was founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young polish girl prepares her poster of pope john paul ii as she waits for him at the kalwaria zebrzydowska sanctuary , 27 miles outside krakow , poland on aug .
19 , 2002 .
the pope is said to have met with the movement 's leader , lech walesa , several times in secret during the 1980s .
according to walesa , the role of john paul ii in the fight against communism should not be underestimated . " he helps us get organized to overthrow communism , " he said .
" thanks to the fact that god gave us a pope from poland , we were able to triumph over communism . " dialog between churches like hardly any other pope in history , john paul ii promoted ecumenical dialog and worked towards a unity of the christian churches .
for example , in romania , he lobbied for the normalization of relations between the greek orthodox and catholic churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims and tourists walk by the virgin mary shrine cave associated with miraculous cures at lourdes , southwest france , thursday aug 12 , 2004 .
pope john paul ii made a trip to lourdes , near the pyrenees mountains .
john paul ii was often critical of the increasing materialism in today 's society and exhorted people to remember the poor and the weak .
his own health problems underlined his own engagement for sick and fragile people .
his last visit to the french pilgrimage site of lourdes -lrb- photo -rrb- received special attention , large due to his obviously declining health . " the head of the church does n't have to be like california governor arnold schwarzenegger , some kind of superman , in order to lead the church , " said cardinal jean-marie lustiger , former archbishop of paris . spoke to conservative anglicans in great britain , the catholic church plays a somewhat subordinate role to the state-supported church of england , of which 57 percent of britons are members .
but several million irish also live in great britain , and they are almost without exception catholics .
not least because of them , john paul ii decided to visit england , scotland and wales in 1982 , the first pope in the history of the church to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think his greatest conviction lay in the dignity of man , " said vincent nichols , archbishop of birmingham .
" he respected life in its every stage , from conception to death . " it was evidently his strong beliefs on the matters of female priests and birth control that enabled the catholic church to win converts from the anglicans .
the anglican church has been in crisis since controversies flared over homosexuality and women priests .
for conservative anglicans , the catholic church represents a christian world still the way it should be , and many decided to convert to catholicism . world figure according to eamonn duffy , a professor of christian history at cambridge university , the pope 's personality made john paul ii into a significant figure on the world stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think , he will be seen as one of the few really great popes , partly because of his unusual life experience that influenced his time in office , " he said .
" there has n't been another pope since the middle ages who has had the kind of direct effect of world politics or who has contributed to the political liberation of so many people . " the slovaks belong to that group .
the head of the catholic church visited slovakia three times .
it is a small country , with a big catholic tradition ; 60 percent of the population is catholic .
the pope visited all the large cities of the country and took the opportunity to speak with the people directly - particularly the young . " when i met the holy father , i knew that we are not alone in this world , " said 22-year-old juraj .
" he is a symbol , proof of our faith . " petra kohnen -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?

in europe , his name will be inextricably tied to the fall of communism in eastern europe . for europe 's smallest state , vatican city , oct.16 , 1978 was an important day .
on st. peter 's square , a new pope was proclaimed , karol wojtyla , the archbishop of cracow .
it was the first time in more than 400 years that a non-italian had taken over the leadership of the catholic church . " have no fear , open the doors for christ , yes , tear them open for him ! "
john paul ii said in his first sermon as the bishop of rome . the catholic church in poland had given impetus to the election of karol wojtyla as pope , but the community party central committee in warsaw was worried .
at his first mass as pope on victory square in warsaw in july 1979 , john paul ii delivered a political message , which he cleverly disguised . " do not be afraid .
the holy ghost will descend and renew the countenance of this earth .
this polish earth , " he said . stimulus for change it was a masked call to revolt against repression and inhumanity and the papal trip developed into a political demonstration .
just a year later , the fruits of that trip were evident - in 1980 , the solidarity movement was founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young polish girl prepares her poster of pope john paul ii as she waits for him at the kalwaria zebrzydowska sanctuary , 27 miles outside krakow , poland on aug .
19 , 2002 .
the pope is said to have met with the movement 's leader , lech walesa , several times in secret during the 1980s .
according to walesa , the role of john paul ii in the fight against communism should not be underestimated . " he helps us get organized to overthrow communism , " he said .
" thanks to the fact that god gave us a pope from poland , we were able to triumph over communism . " dialog between churches like hardly any other pope in history , john paul ii promoted ecumenical dialog and worked towards a unity of the christian churches .
for example , in romania , he lobbied for the normalization of relations between the greek orthodox and catholic churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims and tourists walk by the virgin mary shrine cave associated with miraculous cures at lourdes , southwest france , thursday aug 12 , 2004 .
pope john paul ii made a trip to lourdes , near the pyrenees mountains .
john paul ii was often critical of the increasing materialism in today 's society and exhorted people to remember the poor and the weak .
his own health problems underlined his own engagement for sick and fragile people .
his last visit to the french pilgrimage site of lourdes -lrb- photo -rrb- received special attention , large due to his obviously declining health . " the head of the church does n't have to be like california governor arnold schwarzenegger , some kind of superman , in order to lead the church , " said cardinal jean-marie lustiger , former archbishop of paris . spoke to conservative anglicans in great britain , the catholic church plays a somewhat subordinate role to the state-supported church of england , of which 57 percent of britons are members .
but several million irish also live in great britain , and they are almost without exception catholics .
not least because of them , john paul ii decided to visit england , scotland and wales in 1982 , the first pope in the history of the church to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think his greatest conviction lay in the dignity of man , " said vincent nichols , archbishop of birmingham .
" he respected life in its every stage , from conception to death . " it was evidently his strong beliefs on the matters of female priests and birth control that enabled the catholic church to win converts from the anglicans .
the anglican church has been in crisis since controversies flared over homosexuality and women priests .
for conservative anglicans , the catholic church represents a christian world still the way it should be , and many decided to convert to catholicism . world figure according to eamonn duffy , a professor of christian history at cambridge university , the pope 's personality made john paul ii into a significant figure on the world stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think , he will be seen as one of the few really great popes , partly because of his unusual life experience that influenced his time in office , " he said .
" there has n't been another pope since the middle ages who has had the kind of direct effect of world politics or who has contributed to the political liberation of so many people . " the slovaks belong to that group .
the head of the catholic church visited slovakia three times .
it is a small country , with a big catholic tradition ; 60 percent of the population is catholic .
the pope visited all the large cities of the country and took the opportunity to speak with the people directly - particularly the young . " when i met the holy father , i knew that we are not alone in this world , " said 22-year-old juraj .
" he is a symbol , proof of our faith . " petra kohnen -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de could a bavarian become pope ?
while some priests say talk of a papal resignation is in bad taste , others are looking for the man who will come after john paul ii , and there 's a chance it might be german cardinal joseph ratzinger .

afterwards , he plans to appear in tv ads to explain the constitution to french voters and its importance . at the same time the energetic head of chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , nicolas sarkozy , appeared on the television talk show " 100 minutes to convince , " where he pushed the merits of the constitution in a heated discussion with one of its leading opponents . " i will engage all my energies to tell the french one thing : the rules that europe operates under have to change , " sarkozy said on tv as reported by afp .
" there is not one element in the constitution - not a single one - that will make the situation worse .
on the contrary there are many that will make things better . " left making trouble meanwhile francois bayrou , president of the ump 's coalition partner the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , held his first public meeting outside the northern city of lille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority skeptical and on the political left ps leader francois hollande , who is opposed on the constitution issue by about half of his own party 's rank-and-file , appeared at a campaign rally in the southern city of marseille . " it will be a chance to say yes to the yes and no to the no - because we are well aware that a ' no ' in france would be the end of political europe , " hollande told afp . afraid of losing jobs supporters of the eu 's constitution have watched in horror over the past two weeks as five successive opinion polls have put the " no " campaign for the may 29 referendum in the lead with between 51 and 55 percent of the vote . the growth of the " no " camp has been strongest on the political left , fed by a wave of social discontent as voters increasingly identify the eu with their most pressing concerns : 10 percent unemployment , stagnant wage packets and the flight of jobs to low-protection economies in the east . debating with sarkozy , a leading socialist opponent on the constitution , henri emmanuelli , said it was a " liberal " treaty which would bind all future european governments into following free-market economics . sarkozy retorted that it was the first european text in 50 years to contain - in the charter of fundamental rights - a " social ambition . " " all the trade unions in europe are calling for a vote in favour ...
are all europe 's trade unionists , are all the european socialist parties wrong . " the constitution is meant to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc by creating posts of president and foreign minister and adapting voting procedures .
however , it must first be approved by all 25 members , and a rejection in so large a country as france would be an unprecedented setback . chirac 's ruling center-right ump and its centrist ally the udf are both enthusiastic supporters of the text , as is ps leader hollande and other socialist heavyweights such as former ministers dominique strauss-kahn and jack lang . but the opposition now embraces a wide coalition including the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , traditionalist anti-europeans such as philippe de villier 's movement for france , the far-left trotskyites and communists and the left-wing of the ps . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french corruption erodes trust in politics the latest corruption trial of the french president 's cronies leaves the public shaking their heads , yet again .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .

matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .

tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .

in europe , his name will be inextricably tied to the fall of communism in eastern europe . for europe 's smallest state , vatican city , oct.16 , 1978 was an important day .
on st. peter 's square , a new pope was proclaimed , karol wojtyla , the archbishop of cracow .
it was the first time in more than 400 years that a non-italian had taken over the leadership of the catholic church . " have no fear , open the doors for christ , yes , tear them open for him ! "
john paul ii said in his first sermon as the bishop of rome . the catholic church in poland had given impetus to the election of karol wojtyla as pope , but the community party central committee in warsaw was worried .
at his first mass as pope on victory square in warsaw in july 1979 , john paul ii delivered a political message , which he cleverly disguised . " do not be afraid .
the holy ghost will descend and renew the countenance of this earth .
this polish earth , " he said . stimulus for change it was a masked call to revolt against repression and inhumanity and the papal trip developed into a political demonstration .
just a year later , the fruits of that trip were evident - in 1980 , the solidarity movement was founded . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young polish girl prepares her poster of pope john paul ii as she waits for him at the kalwaria zebrzydowska sanctuary , 27 miles outside krakow , poland on aug .
19 , 2002 .
the pope is said to have met with the movement 's leader , lech walesa , several times in secret during the 1980s .
according to walesa , the role of john paul ii in the fight against communism should not be underestimated . " he helps us get organized to overthrow communism , " he said .
" thanks to the fact that god gave us a pope from poland , we were able to triumph over communism . " dialog between churches like hardly any other pope in history , john paul ii promoted ecumenical dialog and worked towards a unity of the christian churches .
for example , in romania , he lobbied for the normalization of relations between the greek orthodox and catholic churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims and tourists walk by the virgin mary shrine cave associated with miraculous cures at lourdes , southwest france , thursday aug 12 , 2004 .
pope john paul ii made a trip to lourdes , near the pyrenees mountains .
john paul ii was often critical of the increasing materialism in today 's society and exhorted people to remember the poor and the weak .
his own health problems underlined his own engagement for sick and fragile people .
his last visit to the french pilgrimage site of lourdes -lrb- photo -rrb- received special attention , large due to his obviously declining health . " the head of the church does n't have to be like california governor arnold schwarzenegger , some kind of superman , in order to lead the church , " said cardinal jean-marie lustiger , former archbishop of paris . spoke to conservative anglicans in great britain , the catholic church plays a somewhat subordinate role to the state-supported church of england , of which 57 percent of britons are members .
but several million irish also live in great britain , and they are almost without exception catholics .
not least because of them , john paul ii decided to visit england , scotland and wales in 1982 , the first pope in the history of the church to do so . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think his greatest conviction lay in the dignity of man , " said vincent nichols , archbishop of birmingham .
" he respected life in its every stage , from conception to death . " it was evidently his strong beliefs on the matters of female priests and birth control that enabled the catholic church to win converts from the anglicans .
the anglican church has been in crisis since controversies flared over homosexuality and women priests .
for conservative anglicans , the catholic church represents a christian world still the way it should be , and many decided to convert to catholicism . world figure according to eamonn duffy , a professor of christian history at cambridge university , the pope 's personality made john paul ii into a significant figure on the world stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think , he will be seen as one of the few really great popes , partly because of his unusual life experience that influenced his time in office , " he said .
" there has n't been another pope since the middle ages who has had the kind of direct effect of world politics or who has contributed to the political liberation of so many people . " the slovaks belong to that group .
the head of the catholic church visited slovakia three times .
it is a small country , with a big catholic tradition ; 60 percent of the population is catholic .
the pope visited all the large cities of the country and took the opportunity to speak with the people directly - particularly the young . " when i met the holy father , i knew that we are not alone in this world , " said 22-year-old juraj .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : france and the eu 's future chirac 's final ' yes ' pitch for eu constitution french " yes " campaign tries to turn tide expected french ' non ' hits euro courting the constitution europe -pipe- 02.04.2005 french ' yes ' referendum camp fights back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he wants a " oui " french president jacques chirac is leading an offensive to convince reluctant french voters of the merits of the eu constitution . badly rattled by opinion polls showing that enemies of the eu 's new constitution will win france 's referendum in may , supporters of a " yes " vote inside both the government and the socialist party -lrb- ps -rrb- opposition launched a long-awaited offensive thursday to regain lost ground . to the delight of political allies who say he has not done enough to mobilize opinion , president jacques chirac announced that he will make his first public contribution to the campaign in a televised debate with young people on april 7 .
afterwards , he plans to appear in tv ads to explain the constitution to french voters and its importance . at the same time the energetic head of chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , nicolas sarkozy , appeared on the television talk show " 100 minutes to convince , " where he pushed the merits of the constitution in a heated discussion with one of its leading opponents . " i will engage all my energies to tell the french one thing : the rules that europe operates under have to change , " sarkozy said on tv as reported by afp .
" there is not one element in the constitution - not a single one - that will make the situation worse .
on the contrary there are many that will make things better . " left making trouble meanwhile francois bayrou , president of the ump 's coalition partner the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , held his first public meeting outside the northern city of lille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority skeptical and on the political left ps leader francois hollande , who is opposed on the constitution issue by about half of his own party 's rank-and-file , appeared at a campaign rally in the southern city of marseille . " it will be a chance to say yes to the yes and no to the no - because we are well aware that a ' no ' in france would be the end of political europe , " hollande told afp . afraid of losing jobs supporters of the eu 's constitution have watched in horror over the past two weeks as five successive opinion polls have put the " no " campaign for the may 29 referendum in the lead with between 51 and 55 percent of the vote . the growth of the " no " camp has been strongest on the political left , fed by a wave of social discontent as voters increasingly identify the eu with their most pressing concerns : 10 percent unemployment , stagnant wage packets and the flight of jobs to low-protection economies in the east . debating with sarkozy , a leading socialist opponent on the constitution , henri emmanuelli , said it was a " liberal " treaty which would bind all future european governments into following free-market economics . sarkozy retorted that it was the first european text in 50 years to contain - in the charter of fundamental rights - a " social ambition . " " all the trade unions in europe are calling for a vote in favour ...
are all europe 's trade unionists , are all the european socialist parties wrong . " the constitution is meant to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc by creating posts of president and foreign minister and adapting voting procedures .
however , it must first be approved by all 25 members , and a rejection in so large a country as france would be an unprecedented setback . chirac 's ruling center-right ump and its centrist ally the udf are both enthusiastic supporters of the text , as is ps leader hollande and other socialist heavyweights such as former ministers dominique strauss-kahn and jack lang . but the opposition now embraces a wide coalition including the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , traditionalist anti-europeans such as philippe de villier 's movement for france , the far-left trotskyites and communists and the left-wing of the ps . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french corruption erodes trust in politics the latest corruption trial of the french president 's cronies leaves the public shaking their heads , yet again .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .

afterwards , he plans to appear in tv ads to explain the constitution to french voters and its importance . at the same time the energetic head of chirac 's union for a popular movement -lrb- ump -rrb- party , nicolas sarkozy , appeared on the television talk show " 100 minutes to convince , " where he pushed the merits of the constitution in a heated discussion with one of its leading opponents . " i will engage all my energies to tell the french one thing : the rules that europe operates under have to change , " sarkozy said on tv as reported by afp .
" there is not one element in the constitution - not a single one - that will make the situation worse .
on the contrary there are many that will make things better . " left making trouble meanwhile francois bayrou , president of the ump 's coalition partner the union for french democracy -lrb- udf -rrb- , held his first public meeting outside the northern city of lille . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a majority skeptical and on the political left ps leader francois hollande , who is opposed on the constitution issue by about half of his own party 's rank-and-file , appeared at a campaign rally in the southern city of marseille . " it will be a chance to say yes to the yes and no to the no - because we are well aware that a ' no ' in france would be the end of political europe , " hollande told afp . afraid of losing jobs supporters of the eu 's constitution have watched in horror over the past two weeks as five successive opinion polls have put the " no " campaign for the may 29 referendum in the lead with between 51 and 55 percent of the vote . the growth of the " no " camp has been strongest on the political left , fed by a wave of social discontent as voters increasingly identify the eu with their most pressing concerns : 10 percent unemployment , stagnant wage packets and the flight of jobs to low-protection economies in the east . debating with sarkozy , a leading socialist opponent on the constitution , henri emmanuelli , said it was a " liberal " treaty which would bind all future european governments into following free-market economics . sarkozy retorted that it was the first european text in 50 years to contain - in the charter of fundamental rights - a " social ambition . " " all the trade unions in europe are calling for a vote in favour ...
are all europe 's trade unionists , are all the european socialist parties wrong . " the constitution is meant to streamline decision-making in the expanding bloc by creating posts of president and foreign minister and adapting voting procedures .
however , it must first be approved by all 25 members , and a rejection in so large a country as france would be an unprecedented setback . chirac 's ruling center-right ump and its centrist ally the udf are both enthusiastic supporters of the text , as is ps leader hollande and other socialist heavyweights such as former ministers dominique strauss-kahn and jack lang . but the opposition now embraces a wide coalition including the far-right national front of jean-marie le pen , traditionalist anti-europeans such as philippe de villier 's movement for france , the far-left trotskyites and communists and the left-wing of the ps . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de french corruption erodes trust in politics the latest corruption trial of the french president 's cronies leaves the public shaking their heads , yet again .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.04.2005 bank accounts open to tax officials großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a piggy bank is the only place to hide money from tax officials now a law that reveals germans ' bank account information to tax offices went into effect friday and the end of an associated tax amnesty resulted in some people transferring funds to the open arms of austrian banks . even though the new german " law for tax honesty " would not reveal an account 's balance , deposit or withdrawal information , investigators can find out account owners names and addresses along with an account 's opening and closing dates , provided they have good reason to do so .
" it is good news for all honest taxpayers , " barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , said in a statement last week .
though germans are typically thought to fill out every form in minute detail , tax offices estimate evasion through misleading filings cost the government millions of euros every year .
the government has not announced how much tax revenue it hopes to recoup using the new law .
law trades amnesty for prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evasion is estimated to cost germany millions in lost revenue a 15-month tax amnesty law , aimed at bringing money in foreign banks back to germany , brought 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- into the treasury 's coffers , much less than the 5 billion euros german finance minister hans eichel had hoped .
the new law for tax honesty , which began as a way of combating money laundering for terrorism after sept .
11 attacks in the united states , developed a central processing system that allowed government investigators a look at account data in the country 's 2,400 banks .
as quick as google ?
tax investigators as well as social and welfare officials now will be able to use the system to determine what types of accounts a person has .
" now it 's like google , " said thomas schluter , a spokesman for the federal association of german banks .
" they put in a name and date of birth , and out comes the information . "
government officials say the process is much more arduous and is closely monitored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker was sentenced to two years ' probation for tax evasion and fined for 300,000 euros in 2002 when an account sparks investigators interest , the first step is to confront the owners with their suspicions , allowing them to answer the inquiries .
if investigators remain apprehensive , the next step is to fill out the required form , either by hand or with a typewriter , get a supervisor 's signature and post the form to a central agency in berlin " a clerk who does this much work , only does it when he has a good reason for it , " nikolaus gross of munich 's main tax office told the süddeutsche zeitung friday .
german funds deposited abroad competitive pressure from other international banks is leaving some german institutions wondering if they 'll lose customers to switzerland , luxembourg and austria . " it 's a clear weakening of germany 's status as a financial center , " hermann burbaum , head of the volksbank raesfeld , who challenged the law in germany 's highest court last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's ubs bank wo n't be a safe haven for german funds when eu rules go into effect austrian newspapers estimate that germans have deposited between 50 billion euros and 70 billion euros in the southern neighbor , where they are more than welcome .
" we all profit from this , " austrian-state bank association head josef kassler .
" and we do n't even have to advertise much for it . "
still , austria and other european countries will only be a temporary solution for wealthy germans looking to avoid the 42-percent top tax bracket .
starting july 1 , the european union plans to force member states , and associated countries like switzerland , to share bank details about nonresident customers to their home countries . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law allows officials to access bank details a decision by germany 's highest court wednesday allowed tax and welfare offices to peek into citizens ' bank accounts if they suspect fraud or tax evasion .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .
matthias sammer 's boys can stir things up in the title chase next week .
they face schalke .
bremen for their part have to look behind them some .

" it is good news for all honest taxpayers , " barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , said in a statement last week .
though germans are typically thought to fill out every form in minute detail , tax offices estimate evasion through misleading filings cost the government millions of euros every year .
the government has not announced how much tax revenue it hopes to recoup using the new law .

the new law for tax honesty , which began as a way of combating money laundering for terrorism after sept .
11 attacks in the united states , developed a central processing system that allowed government investigators a look at account data in the country 's 2,400 banks .
as quick as google ?
tax investigators as well as social and welfare officials now will be able to use the system to determine what types of accounts a person has .
" now it 's like google , " said thomas schluter , a spokesman for the federal association of german banks .
" they put in a name and date of birth , and out comes the information . "
government officials say the process is much more arduous and is closely monitored .

" poland 's press on saturday prepared poles for the imminent death of their countryman with headlines such as " christ opens the door to the pope . " " there is no more hope , according to the news from the vatican .
it is not only catholics all around the world who have been praying for the pope , " the daily rzeczpospolita said , carrying photos of the faithful in new york , calcutta and across poland on its front page . the bridging of differing faiths by 84-year-old pontiff was praised by the daily le matin , of morocco , where the pope visited in 1985 .
" he spoke words of hope and friendship and gave a concrete sense to the reconciliation between islam and the -lrb- catholic -rrb- church , " the newspaper said . " the pope has taught us how to die " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john paul ii 's courage in the face of death was highlighted by the british conservative newspaper the daily telegraph .
the pope " has used the most powerful imagery - that of a dying man - to bear witness to the life and death of christ , " said the telegraph , which concluded " the pope has taught us all how to die . " this theme was also used in the german press , with the conservative daily die welt saying the pope has " provided a more profound image of man " beyond strength and good health , an " affirmation for people who are sick , weak and old . " the pontiff shows publicly that " suffering is part of life , " write the the süddeutsche zeitung daily . pope john paul ii was described as " the most important pope since saint peter " under the headline of " pope of popes " by british conservative daily the times , which also emphasized his role in taking " rome to the world .

" the british tabloid the sun noted the pope 's " pivotal role in the defeat of communism and the fall of the berlin wall . "
this aspect was also reported by russian newspapers .
" the pope played more than a small part in the collapse of the socialist system , " wrote the opposition newspaper kommersant .
" the 1981 attempt on his life , behind which , according to western experts , stands the kgb , is linked to precisely this aspect of his activities , " kommersant added . but the official government daily rossiiskaya gazeta also noted the close , personal relationship that existed between former russian president boris yeltsin and his successor vladimir putin and the pontiff . the pope 's activities had resulted in a " so far unseen opening of the catholic church towards events in the modern world , " according to the croatian newspaper novi list . italian press bid a fond farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy , home to the vatican , had the most personal tribute to the pope .

" thank you , wojtyla , " said secolo d 'italia , using the pontiff 's polish family name at birth , while il tempo wrote " ciao , karol , " using his original given name . in majority catholic spain , the press gave blanket coverage to the dying pope .
" the pope in his final hours , " headlined the conservative , catholic newspaper abc .
" the pope 's death throes , " headlined the center-left el periodico , which carried front-page photographs of crowds of the faithful holding vigils in st peter 's square . even adversaries pay tribute even the secular , left-leaning el pais , which has clashed with spain 's powerful catholic church over such issues as gay marriage and contraception , devoted an 11-page spread to the pope following the sharp deterioration of his health on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his critical condition was the front page in the press of largely catholic nigeria , with the national interest headline : " end of an era as pope john paul ii battles death . " in predominantly non-catholic countries such as greece , where the orthodox church was strongly opposed to the pope , the right-wing daily eleftheros typos remarked : " both his enemies and his friends recognize that he has left his mark on the world .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .
matthias sammer 's boys can stir things up in the title chase next week .
they face schalke .
bremen for their part have to look behind them some .
they lie in fourth place on 47 points but two of their pursuers , hamburg and leverkusen stumbled with a draw and a loss respectively .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .
when addressed by members of his household , he responds correctly . "
earlier saturday , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said the 84-year-old pope 's overall heart and breathing conditions had not changed and remained " very serious . " tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .
in an indication of the pontiff 's worsening health , a mass was celebrated saturday morning in the pope 's presence , but significantly he did not take an active role in the ceremony as he had the day before . bildunterschrift : thousands of people pray in on st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday navarro-valls said in a statement : " the general , cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions of the holy father are substantially unchanged and therefore are very serious . "
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "
the next vatican 's statement on the pope 's condition is n't expected until sunday morning .
saying goodbye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims pray for during a mass on saturday in lourdes , france , where roman catholic tradition says st. bernadette saw visions of mary in a grotto in 1858 .

" i saw him very relaxed , " he said , adding he had prayed beside the pope and kissed his hand . the pontiff also appointed two new archbishops and papal ambassadors and accepted the resignations of three other prelates , approved last month , the vatican said saturday .
the previous day , he had appointed 17 new bishops and accepted the resignation of six others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls from spain in a communique issued shortly before 1900 cet on friday , navarro-valls -lrb- photo -rrb- said the pontiff 's condition was worsening , his breathing had become shallow and his blood pressure was falling . doctors surprised " the pope has an extraordinary physique , and at the moment even his doctors are surprised " at his will to live , said corrado manni , an anaesthetist who has been present at several of the pope 's 10 surgical operations .
" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .
" i was captured by the beauty of this smiling look .
he clearly wanted me to understand that he recognized me , " pompedda told the daily la repubblica . obituary appears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faithful pray in cologne cathedral on friday many newspapers , however , already spoke of the pontiff in the past tense .
the turin daily la stampa even published a full obituary on its front page , entitled " john paul ii 1978-2005 . " the pontiff , who has parkinson 's disease , severe lung and throat problems and has long been confined to a wheelchair , suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse late thursday , when he was given the last rites . the crowd in st peter 's square swelled to nearly 70,000 at one point after midnight friday , but as the hours passed the numbers dwindled to several hundred gazing up at the pope 's windows . a revolutionary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two girls protect a candle flame as faithful gather for prayers in st. peter 's square at the vatican on friday across the world , from his native poland to indonesia , from the americas to the middle east , millions of others also prayed for a pontiff who has led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter of a century . born karol wojtyla in a small town near cracow , southern poland , he is the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries and the 263rd successor to saint peter - one of the disciples of jesus - as bishop of rome .
elected pontiff in 1978 at the age of 58 , he revolutionized the papacy and contributed to the collapse of communism in eastern europe . but he also alienated many catholics with his conservative social views , especially dealing with sex in a world struggling with aids . in poland , the press prepared for the death of their countryman .

that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 02.04.2005 title hopes for bremen now zero großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's ernst , white , looks sharp but his side was clumsy in 2-1 loss reigning champs werder bremen had lost to schalke and bayern munich in the second leg .
to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .
matthias sammer 's boys can stir things up in the title chase next week .
they face schalke .
bremen for their part have to look behind them some .
they lie in fourth place on 47 points but two of their pursuers , hamburg and leverkusen stumbled with a draw and a loss respectively .
next week , hamburg and bremen meet in a northern derby . john kluempers send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga finally focuses on rising east years after teams from england , italy and spain , the german bundesliga is finally beginning to discover the potential of the asian market .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .
matthias sammer 's boys can stir things up in the title chase next week .
they face schalke .
bremen for their part have to look behind them some .
they lie in fourth place on 47 points but two of their pursuers , hamburg and leverkusen stumbled with a draw and a loss respectively .

the company also wants to check and possibly replace the voltage regulator in alternators in six and eight cylinder vehicles built between june 2001 and november 2004 .
company officials also want to update battery unit software in its e-class and cls-class models made from january 2002 to january this year .
it is the company 's biggest recall to date , one that is not motivated by car safety concerns . quality improvement will affect profits company officials have already said that the push to improve product quality would decrease profits .
" we are now producing the best product quality ever and our aim is to ensure that those vehicles in the hands of customers which are the cause of complaints achieve a standard of quality that reflects our highest expectations , " mercedes chief eckhard cordes said in a statement to reuters .
daimlerchrysler officials declined to tally the exact cost of the recall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of quality ? shares dip georg stuerzer , an analyst at hvb group in munich told reuters that costs could run as high as hundreds of millions of euros .
" on this kind of scale i expect the cost to run into the three-digit million-euro range , " he told the news agency .
" the quality campaign will weigh further on the company 's first quarter . " shares in daimlerchrysler dipped after news of the recall .
mercedes has traditionally been daimler 's most lucrative business , but has had a bumpy ride in recent quarters .

as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "

" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .
when addressed by members of his household , he responds correctly . "
earlier saturday , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said the 84-year-old pope 's overall heart and breathing conditions had not changed and remained " very serious . " tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .
in an indication of the pontiff 's worsening health , a mass was celebrated saturday morning in the pope 's presence , but significantly he did not take an active role in the ceremony as he had the day before . bildunterschrift : thousands of people pray in on st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday navarro-valls said in a statement : " the general , cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions of the holy father are substantially unchanged and therefore are very serious . "
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "
the next vatican 's statement on the pope 's condition is n't expected until sunday morning .

" i saw him very relaxed , " he said , adding he had prayed beside the pope and kissed his hand . the pontiff also appointed two new archbishops and papal ambassadors and accepted the resignations of three other prelates , approved last month , the vatican said saturday .

" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .

but is there enough room for them ? on a recent trip to china , rainer kübler was stunned at the amount of soccer the billion-strong country watches . highlights from the english , spanish and italian leagues were broadcast almost around the clock .
only one of europe 's major leagues was conspicuous in its infrequency : the bundesliga . " we are far behind the others , " said kübler , who two years ago became the asia point man for the berlin soccer club hertha bsc . unlike the continent 's other big leagues , germany 's top division has only recently begun taking a serious look at the rapidly expanding chinese market and its massive pool of young talent .
two years ago , 1860 munich signed the first chinese player in the bundesliga .
last year , their cross-town rivals , fc bayern munich planned a tour of chinese cities that they only cancelled because of the sars scare .
they plan to try the tour again this year , and will be shadowed by hamburg sv , one of the league 's most asia ambitious clubs . new sources of income " teams are permanently looking for new sources of financing and with the domestic market exploited , they need to look across borders for other possibilities , " says manfred schubert , lecturer at the cologne sports academy . with a market in east asia estimated at 3.5 billion people , an increasing number of them massive soccer fans , one wonders why they did n't move earlier .

's every move and teenagers and fans crushed against police barriers surrounding their practice facilities . with no beckham at their disposal and no aggressive marketing campaign by individual teams , the bundesliga has had a very difficult time abroad .
recent figures by the hamburg marketing firm sport five show that the bundesliga is far behind the three major european soccer leagues in terms of video footage sold .

the company also wants to check and possibly replace the voltage regulator in alternators in six and eight cylinder vehicles built between june 2001 and november 2004 .
company officials also want to update battery unit software in its e-class and cls-class models made from january 2002 to january this year .
it is the company 's biggest recall to date , one that is not motivated by car safety concerns . quality improvement will affect profits company officials have already said that the push to improve product quality would decrease profits .
" we are now producing the best product quality ever and our aim is to ensure that those vehicles in the hands of customers which are the cause of complaints achieve a standard of quality that reflects our highest expectations , " mercedes chief eckhard cordes said in a statement to reuters .
daimlerchrysler officials declined to tally the exact cost of the recall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : symbol of quality ? shares dip georg stuerzer , an analyst at hvb group in munich told reuters that costs could run as high as hundreds of millions of euros .
" on this kind of scale i expect the cost to run into the three-digit million-euro range , " he told the news agency .
" the quality campaign will weigh further on the company 's first quarter . " shares in daimlerchrysler dipped after news of the recall .
mercedes has traditionally been daimler 's most lucrative business , but has had a bumpy ride in recent quarters .
mercedes ' profits , which slid from 20 million euros -lrb- $ 25.8 million -rrb- in the last quarter of 2004 , have been affected by strong competition , losses by its smart car brand , a strong euro as a result of the drop of the us dollar , the cost of launching new models and increased spending to fix quality problems . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de prosecutors probe daimlerchrysler prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .
when addressed by members of his household , he responds correctly . "
earlier saturday , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said the 84-year-old pope 's overall heart and breathing conditions had not changed and remained " very serious . " tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .
in an indication of the pontiff 's worsening health , a mass was celebrated saturday morning in the pope 's presence , but significantly he did not take an active role in the ceremony as he had the day before . bildunterschrift : thousands of people pray in on st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday navarro-valls said in a statement : " the general , cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions of the holy father are substantially unchanged and therefore are very serious . "
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "
the next vatican 's statement on the pope 's condition is n't expected until sunday morning .
saying goodbye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims pray for during a mass on saturday in lourdes , france , where roman catholic tradition says st. bernadette saw visions of mary in a grotto in 1858 .
cardinal joseph ratzinger said after visiting the pontiff early saturday that he " knows he is dying and said his last goodbye " to the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , according to sky italia television . another visitor , italian cardinal achille silvestrini , said the pope " gave signs of recognizing people .
" i saw him very relaxed , " he said , adding he had prayed beside the pope and kissed his hand . the pontiff also appointed two new archbishops and papal ambassadors and accepted the resignations of three other prelates , approved last month , the vatican said saturday .
the previous day , he had appointed 17 new bishops and accepted the resignation of six others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls from spain in a communique issued shortly before 1900 cet on friday , navarro-valls -lrb- photo -rrb- said the pontiff 's condition was worsening , his breathing had become shallow and his blood pressure was falling . doctors surprised " the pope has an extraordinary physique , and at the moment even his doctors are surprised " at his will to live , said corrado manni , an anaesthetist who has been present at several of the pope 's 10 surgical operations .
" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .
" i was captured by the beauty of this smiling look .
he clearly wanted me to understand that he recognized me , " pompedda told the daily la repubblica . obituary appears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faithful pray in cologne cathedral on friday many newspapers , however , already spoke of the pontiff in the past tense .
the turin daily la stampa even published a full obituary on its front page , entitled " john paul ii 1978-2005 . " the pontiff , who has parkinson 's disease , severe lung and throat problems and has long been confined to a wheelchair , suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse late thursday , when he was given the last rites . the crowd in st peter 's square swelled to nearly 70,000 at one point after midnight friday , but as the hours passed the numbers dwindled to several hundred gazing up at the pope 's windows . a revolutionary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two girls protect a candle flame as faithful gather for prayers in st. peter 's square at the vatican on friday across the world , from his native poland to indonesia , from the americas to the middle east , millions of others also prayed for a pontiff who has led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter of a century . born karol wojtyla in a small town near cracow , southern poland , he is the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries and the 263rd successor to saint peter - one of the disciples of jesus - as bishop of rome .
elected pontiff in 1978 at the age of 58 , he revolutionized the papacy and contributed to the collapse of communism in eastern europe . but he also alienated many catholics with his conservative social views , especially dealing with sex in a world struggling with aids . in poland , the press prepared for the death of their countryman .

" it is good news for all honest taxpayers , " barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , said in a statement last week .
though germans are typically thought to fill out every form in minute detail , tax offices estimate evasion through misleading filings cost the government millions of euros every year .
the government has not announced how much tax revenue it hopes to recoup using the new law .
law trades amnesty for prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evasion is estimated to cost germany millions in lost revenue a 15-month tax amnesty law , aimed at bringing money in foreign banks back to germany , brought 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- into the treasury 's coffers , much less than the 5 billion euros german finance minister hans eichel had hoped .
the new law for tax honesty , which began as a way of combating money laundering for terrorism after sept .
11 attacks in the united states , developed a central processing system that allowed government investigators a look at account data in the country 's 2,400 banks .
as quick as google ?
tax investigators as well as social and welfare officials now will be able to use the system to determine what types of accounts a person has .
" now it 's like google , " said thomas schluter , a spokesman for the federal association of german banks .
" they put in a name and date of birth , and out comes the information . "
government officials say the process is much more arduous and is closely monitored .

if investigators remain apprehensive , the next step is to fill out the required form , either by hand or with a typewriter , get a supervisor 's signature and post the form to a central agency in berlin " a clerk who does this much work , only does it when he has a good reason for it , " nikolaus gross of munich 's main tax office told the süddeutsche zeitung friday .
german funds deposited abroad competitive pressure from other international banks is leaving some german institutions wondering if they 'll lose customers to switzerland , luxembourg and austria . " it 's a clear weakening of germany 's status as a financial center , " hermann burbaum , head of the volksbank raesfeld , who challenged the law in germany 's highest court last week .

" we all profit from this , " austrian-state bank association head josef kassler .
" and we do n't even have to advertise much for it . "
still , austria and other european countries will only be a temporary solution for wealthy germans looking to avoid the 42-percent top tax bracket .

but is there enough room for them ? on a recent trip to china , rainer kübler was stunned at the amount of soccer the billion-strong country watches . highlights from the english , spanish and italian leagues were broadcast almost around the clock .
only one of europe 's major leagues was conspicuous in its infrequency : the bundesliga . " we are far behind the others , " said kübler , who two years ago became the asia point man for the berlin soccer club hertha bsc . unlike the continent 's other big leagues , germany 's top division has only recently begun taking a serious look at the rapidly expanding chinese market and its massive pool of young talent .
two years ago , 1860 munich signed the first chinese player in the bundesliga .
last year , their cross-town rivals , fc bayern munich planned a tour of chinese cities that they only cancelled because of the sars scare .
they plan to try the tour again this year , and will be shadowed by hamburg sv , one of the league 's most asia ambitious clubs . new sources of income " teams are permanently looking for new sources of financing and with the domestic market exploited , they need to look across borders for other possibilities , " says manfred schubert , lecturer at the cologne sports academy . with a market in east asia estimated at 3.5 billion people , an increasing number of them massive soccer fans , one wonders why they did n't move earlier .
the premiere league estimates that 500 million people in asia follow the matches on english soil every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of real madrid holding up a poster of real madrid 's david beckham cheer as they watch the team training in hong kong 's stadium . teams like manchester united and newcastle united regularly make trips to the middle kingdom and other asian countries .
when spain 's superstar team , real madrid , toured there in the summer of 2003 , television cameras followed david beckham and co . 's every move and teenagers and fans crushed against police barriers surrounding their practice facilities . with no beckham at their disposal and no aggressive marketing campaign by individual teams , the bundesliga has had a very difficult time abroad .
recent figures by the hamburg marketing firm sport five show that the bundesliga is far behind the three major european soccer leagues in terms of video footage sold .
last season , the premiership earned 150 million euros -lrb- $ 193 million -rrb- for their game footage abroad .
italy 's serie a followed with 65 million euros and spain 's primera division with 35 million euros . hertha 's xu addition the bundesliga earned 12 million euros . " we have been sleeping , " on the job , said kübler . two years ago , hertha began getting serious about recruiting an asian player and appointed kübler to head its newly-created asia department .
together with other team officials , kübler made several trips to china in the past year , observing teenage talent across the country and running clinics . the hard work has already paid dividends .
beginning next week , xu zhan , a 17-year-old striker talent from peking will begin training with hertha 's amateur team . the club signed him to a three-year contract after bringing him in for a one month trial last november .
" we wanted to get an asian player , " said kübler .
" we are convinced that the asian soccer market is the future , especially with regard to players . " winning over asian fans , one player at a time such players also give german clubs instant name recognition and offer a relatively inexpensive way to market themselves abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with japan already under their belts , thanks to takahara , hamburg is concentrating on china . " hsv did that by signing -lrb- striker naohiro -rrb- takahara , and the japanese market opened up for them , " said schubert .
" i assume other teams will use that method more often in the future . " the interest is n't one-sided .
in preparation for hosting the 2008 olympics in beijing , china , which missed out on qualifying for the world cup in germany next year , wants its young soccer talent in top shape .
when the chinese soccer federation began casting about for locations in europe to set up a soccer academy to train their teen talents a year ago , they settled on bad kissingen , a small town in bavaria mostly known for its spas , which beat out locations france and spain . china 's germany fascination " there is already strong partnerships between germany and china , and bavaria and china , " said bad kissinger mayor heinz laudenbach .
" and when they wanted to do this , they wanted someone they could depend on . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer players relax at the academy in bad kissingen last december , chinese and german officials officially opened the german-chinese soccer academy .
for the first few months , 25 promising chinese players , between the ages of 15 and 20 , trained there . beginning in mid-april there will be 50 players , including professionals from the chinese soccer leagues .
laudenbach says he 's convinced there is still enough time for german soccer to make a good impression . " some were there earlier than others .
but there is great potential , " said laudenbach .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .
when addressed by members of his household , he responds correctly . "
earlier saturday , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said the 84-year-old pope 's overall heart and breathing conditions had not changed and remained " very serious . " tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .
in an indication of the pontiff 's worsening health , a mass was celebrated saturday morning in the pope 's presence , but significantly he did not take an active role in the ceremony as he had the day before . bildunterschrift : thousands of people pray in on st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday navarro-valls said in a statement : " the general , cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions of the holy father are substantially unchanged and therefore are very serious . "
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "
the next vatican 's statement on the pope 's condition is n't expected until sunday morning .
saying goodbye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims pray for during a mass on saturday in lourdes , france , where roman catholic tradition says st. bernadette saw visions of mary in a grotto in 1858 .
cardinal joseph ratzinger said after visiting the pontiff early saturday that he " knows he is dying and said his last goodbye " to the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , according to sky italia television . another visitor , italian cardinal achille silvestrini , said the pope " gave signs of recognizing people .
" i saw him very relaxed , " he said , adding he had prayed beside the pope and kissed his hand . the pontiff also appointed two new archbishops and papal ambassadors and accepted the resignations of three other prelates , approved last month , the vatican said saturday .
the previous day , he had appointed 17 new bishops and accepted the resignation of six others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls from spain in a communique issued shortly before 1900 cet on friday , navarro-valls -lrb- photo -rrb- said the pontiff 's condition was worsening , his breathing had become shallow and his blood pressure was falling . doctors surprised " the pope has an extraordinary physique , and at the moment even his doctors are surprised " at his will to live , said corrado manni , an anaesthetist who has been present at several of the pope 's 10 surgical operations .
" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .
" i was captured by the beauty of this smiling look .
he clearly wanted me to understand that he recognized me , " pompedda told the daily la repubblica . obituary appears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faithful pray in cologne cathedral on friday many newspapers , however , already spoke of the pontiff in the past tense .
the turin daily la stampa even published a full obituary on its front page , entitled " john paul ii 1978-2005 .

the company also wants to check and possibly replace the voltage regulator in alternators in six and eight cylinder vehicles built between june 2001 and november 2004 .
company officials also want to update battery unit software in its e-class and cls-class models made from january 2002 to january this year .
it is the company 's biggest recall to date , one that is not motivated by car safety concerns . quality improvement will affect profits company officials have already said that the push to improve product quality would decrease profits .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .
when addressed by members of his household , he responds correctly . "
earlier saturday , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said the 84-year-old pope 's overall heart and breathing conditions had not changed and remained " very serious . " tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .
in an indication of the pontiff 's worsening health , a mass was celebrated saturday morning in the pope 's presence , but significantly he did not take an active role in the ceremony as he had the day before . bildunterschrift : thousands of people pray in on st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday navarro-valls said in a statement : " the general , cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions of the holy father are substantially unchanged and therefore are very serious . "
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "
the next vatican 's statement on the pope 's condition is n't expected until sunday morning .

" i saw him very relaxed , " he said , adding he had prayed beside the pope and kissed his hand . the pontiff also appointed two new archbishops and papal ambassadors and accepted the resignations of three other prelates , approved last month , the vatican said saturday .
the previous day , he had appointed 17 new bishops and accepted the resignation of six others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls from spain in a communique issued shortly before 1900 cet on friday , navarro-valls -lrb- photo -rrb- said the pontiff 's condition was worsening , his breathing had become shallow and his blood pressure was falling . doctors surprised " the pope has an extraordinary physique , and at the moment even his doctors are surprised " at his will to live , said corrado manni , an anaesthetist who has been present at several of the pope 's 10 surgical operations .
" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .
" i was captured by the beauty of this smiling look .
he clearly wanted me to understand that he recognized me , " pompedda told the daily la repubblica . obituary appears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faithful pray in cologne cathedral on friday many newspapers , however , already spoke of the pontiff in the past tense .
the turin daily la stampa even published a full obituary on its front page , entitled " john paul ii 1978-2005 . " the pontiff , who has parkinson 's disease , severe lung and throat problems and has long been confined to a wheelchair , suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse late thursday , when he was given the last rites . the crowd in st peter 's square swelled to nearly 70,000 at one point after midnight friday , but as the hours passed the numbers dwindled to several hundred gazing up at the pope 's windows . a revolutionary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two girls protect a candle flame as faithful gather for prayers in st. peter 's square at the vatican on friday across the world , from his native poland to indonesia , from the americas to the middle east , millions of others also prayed for a pontiff who has led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter of a century . born karol wojtyla in a small town near cracow , southern poland , he is the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries and the 263rd successor to saint peter - one of the disciples of jesus - as bishop of rome .

" it is good news for all honest taxpayers , " barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , said in a statement last week .
though germans are typically thought to fill out every form in minute detail , tax offices estimate evasion through misleading filings cost the government millions of euros every year .
the government has not announced how much tax revenue it hopes to recoup using the new law .
law trades amnesty for prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evasion is estimated to cost germany millions in lost revenue a 15-month tax amnesty law , aimed at bringing money in foreign banks back to germany , brought 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- into the treasury 's coffers , much less than the 5 billion euros german finance minister hans eichel had hoped .
the new law for tax honesty , which began as a way of combating money laundering for terrorism after sept .
11 attacks in the united states , developed a central processing system that allowed government investigators a look at account data in the country 's 2,400 banks .
as quick as google ?
tax investigators as well as social and welfare officials now will be able to use the system to determine what types of accounts a person has .
" now it 's like google , " said thomas schluter , a spokesman for the federal association of german banks .
" they put in a name and date of birth , and out comes the information . "
government officials say the process is much more arduous and is closely monitored .

if investigators remain apprehensive , the next step is to fill out the required form , either by hand or with a typewriter , get a supervisor 's signature and post the form to a central agency in berlin " a clerk who does this much work , only does it when he has a good reason for it , " nikolaus gross of munich 's main tax office told the süddeutsche zeitung friday .
german funds deposited abroad competitive pressure from other international banks is leaving some german institutions wondering if they 'll lose customers to switzerland , luxembourg and austria . " it 's a clear weakening of germany 's status as a financial center , " hermann burbaum , head of the volksbank raesfeld , who challenged the law in germany 's highest court last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's ubs bank wo n't be a safe haven for german funds when eu rules go into effect austrian newspapers estimate that germans have deposited between 50 billion euros and 70 billion euros in the southern neighbor , where they are more than welcome .
" we all profit from this , " austrian-state bank association head josef kassler .
" and we do n't even have to advertise much for it . "
still , austria and other european countries will only be a temporary solution for wealthy germans looking to avoid the 42-percent top tax bracket .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .
when addressed by members of his household , he responds correctly . "
earlier saturday , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said the 84-year-old pope 's overall heart and breathing conditions had not changed and remained " very serious . " tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .
in an indication of the pontiff 's worsening health , a mass was celebrated saturday morning in the pope 's presence , but significantly he did not take an active role in the ceremony as he had the day before . bildunterschrift : thousands of people pray in on st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday navarro-valls said in a statement : " the general , cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions of the holy father are substantially unchanged and therefore are very serious . "
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "
the next vatican 's statement on the pope 's condition is n't expected until sunday morning .
saying goodbye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims pray for during a mass on saturday in lourdes , france , where roman catholic tradition says st. bernadette saw visions of mary in a grotto in 1858 .
cardinal joseph ratzinger said after visiting the pontiff early saturday that he " knows he is dying and said his last goodbye " to the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , according to sky italia television . another visitor , italian cardinal achille silvestrini , said the pope " gave signs of recognizing people .
" i saw him very relaxed , " he said , adding he had prayed beside the pope and kissed his hand . the pontiff also appointed two new archbishops and papal ambassadors and accepted the resignations of three other prelates , approved last month , the vatican said saturday .
the previous day , he had appointed 17 new bishops and accepted the resignation of six others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls from spain in a communique issued shortly before 1900 cet on friday , navarro-valls -lrb- photo -rrb- said the pontiff 's condition was worsening , his breathing had become shallow and his blood pressure was falling . doctors surprised " the pope has an extraordinary physique , and at the moment even his doctors are surprised " at his will to live , said corrado manni , an anaesthetist who has been present at several of the pope 's 10 surgical operations .
" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .
" i was captured by the beauty of this smiling look .
he clearly wanted me to understand that he recognized me , " pompedda told the daily la repubblica . obituary appears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faithful pray in cologne cathedral on friday many newspapers , however , already spoke of the pontiff in the past tense .
the turin daily la stampa even published a full obituary on its front page , entitled " john paul ii 1978-2005 . " the pontiff , who has parkinson 's disease , severe lung and throat problems and has long been confined to a wheelchair , suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse late thursday , when he was given the last rites . the crowd in st peter 's square swelled to nearly 70,000 at one point after midnight friday , but as the hours passed the numbers dwindled to several hundred gazing up at the pope 's windows . a revolutionary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two girls protect a candle flame as faithful gather for prayers in st. peter 's square at the vatican on friday across the world , from his native poland to indonesia , from the americas to the middle east , millions of others also prayed for a pontiff who has led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter of a century . born karol wojtyla in a small town near cracow , southern poland , he is the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries and the 263rd successor to saint peter - one of the disciples of jesus - as bishop of rome .
elected pontiff in 1978 at the age of 58 , he revolutionized the papacy and contributed to the collapse of communism in eastern europe . but he also alienated many catholics with his conservative social views , especially dealing with sex in a world struggling with aids . in poland , the press prepared for the death of their countryman .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .
when addressed by members of his household , he responds correctly . "
earlier saturday , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said the 84-year-old pope 's overall heart and breathing conditions had not changed and remained " very serious . " tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .
in an indication of the pontiff 's worsening health , a mass was celebrated saturday morning in the pope 's presence , but significantly he did not take an active role in the ceremony as he had the day before . bildunterschrift : thousands of people pray in on st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday navarro-valls said in a statement : " the general , cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions of the holy father are substantially unchanged and therefore are very serious . "
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "
the next vatican 's statement on the pope 's condition is n't expected until sunday morning .
saying goodbye bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims pray for during a mass on saturday in lourdes , france , where roman catholic tradition says st. bernadette saw visions of mary in a grotto in 1858 .
cardinal joseph ratzinger said after visiting the pontiff early saturday that he " knows he is dying and said his last goodbye " to the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , according to sky italia television . another visitor , italian cardinal achille silvestrini , said the pope " gave signs of recognizing people .
" i saw him very relaxed , " he said , adding he had prayed beside the pope and kissed his hand . the pontiff also appointed two new archbishops and papal ambassadors and accepted the resignations of three other prelates , approved last month , the vatican said saturday .
the previous day , he had appointed 17 new bishops and accepted the resignation of six others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls from spain in a communique issued shortly before 1900 cet on friday , navarro-valls -lrb- photo -rrb- said the pontiff 's condition was worsening , his breathing had become shallow and his blood pressure was falling . doctors surprised " the pope has an extraordinary physique , and at the moment even his doctors are surprised " at his will to live , said corrado manni , an anaesthetist who has been present at several of the pope 's 10 surgical operations .
" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .
" i was captured by the beauty of this smiling look .
he clearly wanted me to understand that he recognized me , " pompedda told the daily la repubblica . obituary appears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faithful pray in cologne cathedral on friday many newspapers , however , already spoke of the pontiff in the past tense .

" poland 's press on saturday prepared poles for the imminent death of their countryman with headlines such as " christ opens the door to the pope . " " there is no more hope , according to the news from the vatican .
it is not only catholics all around the world who have been praying for the pope , " the daily rzeczpospolita said , carrying photos of the faithful in new york , calcutta and across poland on its front page . the bridging of differing faiths by 84-year-old pontiff was praised by the daily le matin , of morocco , where the pope visited in 1985 .
" he spoke words of hope and friendship and gave a concrete sense to the reconciliation between islam and the -lrb- catholic -rrb- church , " the newspaper said . " the pope has taught us how to die " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john paul ii 's courage in the face of death was highlighted by the british conservative newspaper the daily telegraph .
the pope " has used the most powerful imagery - that of a dying man - to bear witness to the life and death of christ , " said the telegraph , which concluded " the pope has taught us all how to die . " this theme was also used in the german press , with the conservative daily die welt saying the pope has " provided a more profound image of man " beyond strength and good health , an " affirmation for people who are sick , weak and old . " the pontiff shows publicly that " suffering is part of life , " write the the süddeutsche zeitung daily . pope john paul ii was described as " the most important pope since saint peter " under the headline of " pope of popes " by british conservative daily the times , which also emphasized his role in taking " rome to the world . " however , the left-leaning british daily the guardian asserted that the " pope 's authoritarian inclinations have reasserted rome 's control but millions of catholics have turned away from the church . " pope 's reformation of the church noted by some bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope 's conservative legacy was also noted by belgian newspaper le soir , which said the pope brought the catholic church " towards a corseted traditionalism " and made it " a force of stagnation and not a factor of progress .

this aspect was also reported by russian newspapers .
" the pope played more than a small part in the collapse of the socialist system , " wrote the opposition newspaper kommersant .
" the 1981 attempt on his life , behind which , according to western experts , stands the kgb , is linked to precisely this aspect of his activities , " kommersant added . but the official government daily rossiiskaya gazeta also noted the close , personal relationship that existed between former russian president boris yeltsin and his successor vladimir putin and the pontiff . the pope 's activities had resulted in a " so far unseen opening of the catholic church towards events in the modern world , " according to the croatian newspaper novi list . italian press bid a fond farewell bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy , home to the vatican , had the most personal tribute to the pope .

" " the love of rome accompanies the pope , " assured the cronaca di roma . " thank you , wojtyla , " said secolo d 'italia , using the pontiff 's polish family name at birth , while il tempo wrote " ciao , karol , " using his original given name . in majority catholic spain , the press gave blanket coverage to the dying pope .
" the pope in his final hours , " headlined the conservative , catholic newspaper abc .
" the pope 's death throes , " headlined the center-left el periodico , which carried front-page photographs of crowds of the faithful holding vigils in st peter 's square . even adversaries pay tribute even the secular , left-leaning el pais , which has clashed with spain 's powerful catholic church over such issues as gay marriage and contraception , devoted an 11-page spread to the pope following the sharp deterioration of his health on thursday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his critical condition was the front page in the press of largely catholic nigeria , with the national interest headline : " end of an era as pope john paul ii battles death . " in predominantly non-catholic countries such as greece , where the orthodox church was strongly opposed to the pope , the right-wing daily eleftheros typos remarked : " both his enemies and his friends recognize that he has left his mark on the world . " however , one newspaper had the misfortune , due to an early deadline , not to mention the pope 's condition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 02.04.2005 title hopes for bremen now zero großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's ernst , white , looks sharp but his side was clumsy in 2-1 loss reigning champs werder bremen had lost to schalke and bayern munich in the second leg .
to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .

but is there enough room for them ? on a recent trip to china , rainer kübler was stunned at the amount of soccer the billion-strong country watches . highlights from the english , spanish and italian leagues were broadcast almost around the clock .
only one of europe 's major leagues was conspicuous in its infrequency : the bundesliga . " we are far behind the others , " said kübler , who two years ago became the asia point man for the berlin soccer club hertha bsc . unlike the continent 's other big leagues , germany 's top division has only recently begun taking a serious look at the rapidly expanding chinese market and its massive pool of young talent .
two years ago , 1860 munich signed the first chinese player in the bundesliga .
last year , their cross-town rivals , fc bayern munich planned a tour of chinese cities that they only cancelled because of the sars scare .
they plan to try the tour again this year , and will be shadowed by hamburg sv , one of the league 's most asia ambitious clubs . new sources of income " teams are permanently looking for new sources of financing and with the domestic market exploited , they need to look across borders for other possibilities , " says manfred schubert , lecturer at the cologne sports academy . with a market in east asia estimated at 3.5 billion people , an increasing number of them massive soccer fans , one wonders why they did n't move earlier .
the premiere league estimates that 500 million people in asia follow the matches on english soil every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of real madrid holding up a poster of real madrid 's david beckham cheer as they watch the team training in hong kong 's stadium . teams like manchester united and newcastle united regularly make trips to the middle kingdom and other asian countries .
when spain 's superstar team , real madrid , toured there in the summer of 2003 , television cameras followed david beckham and co . 's every move and teenagers and fans crushed against police barriers surrounding their practice facilities . with no beckham at their disposal and no aggressive marketing campaign by individual teams , the bundesliga has had a very difficult time abroad .
recent figures by the hamburg marketing firm sport five show that the bundesliga is far behind the three major european soccer leagues in terms of video footage sold .
last season , the premiership earned 150 million euros -lrb- $ 193 million -rrb- for their game footage abroad .
italy 's serie a followed with 65 million euros and spain 's primera division with 35 million euros . hertha 's xu addition the bundesliga earned 12 million euros . " we have been sleeping , " on the job , said kübler . two years ago , hertha began getting serious about recruiting an asian player and appointed kübler to head its newly-created asia department .
together with other team officials , kübler made several trips to china in the past year , observing teenage talent across the country and running clinics . the hard work has already paid dividends .
beginning next week , xu zhan , a 17-year-old striker talent from peking will begin training with hertha 's amateur team . the club signed him to a three-year contract after bringing him in for a one month trial last november .
" we wanted to get an asian player , " said kübler .
" we are convinced that the asian soccer market is the future , especially with regard to players . " winning over asian fans , one player at a time such players also give german clubs instant name recognition and offer a relatively inexpensive way to market themselves abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with japan already under their belts , thanks to takahara , hamburg is concentrating on china . " hsv did that by signing -lrb- striker naohiro -rrb- takahara , and the japanese market opened up for them , " said schubert .
" i assume other teams will use that method more often in the future . " the interest is n't one-sided .
in preparation for hosting the 2008 olympics in beijing , china , which missed out on qualifying for the world cup in germany next year , wants its young soccer talent in top shape .
when the chinese soccer federation began casting about for locations in europe to set up a soccer academy to train their teen talents a year ago , they settled on bad kissingen , a small town in bavaria mostly known for its spas , which beat out locations france and spain . china 's germany fascination " there is already strong partnerships between germany and china , and bavaria and china , " said bad kissinger mayor heinz laudenbach .
" and when they wanted to do this , they wanted someone they could depend on . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chinese soccer players relax at the academy in bad kissingen last december , chinese and german officials officially opened the german-chinese soccer academy .
for the first few months , 25 promising chinese players , between the ages of 15 and 20 , trained there . beginning in mid-april there will be 50 players , including professionals from the chinese soccer leagues .
laudenbach says he 's convinced there is still enough time for german soccer to make a good impression . " some were there earlier than others .

the pope is said to have met with the movement 's leader , lech walesa , several times in secret during the 1980s .
according to walesa , the role of john paul ii in the fight against communism should not be underestimated . " he helps us get organized to overthrow communism , " he said .
" thanks to the fact that god gave us a pope from poland , we were able to triumph over communism . " dialog between churches like hardly any other pope in history , john paul ii promoted ecumenical dialog and worked towards a unity of the christian churches .
for example , in romania , he lobbied for the normalization of relations between the greek orthodox and catholic churches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pilgrims and tourists walk by the virgin mary shrine cave associated with miraculous cures at lourdes , southwest france , thursday aug 12 , 2004 .

the anglican church has been in crisis since controversies flared over homosexuality and women priests .
for conservative anglicans , the catholic church represents a christian world still the way it should be , and many decided to convert to catholicism . world figure according to eamonn duffy , a professor of christian history at cambridge university , the pope 's personality made john paul ii into a significant figure on the world stage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " i think , he will be seen as one of the few really great popes , partly because of his unusual life experience that influenced his time in office , " he said .
" there has n't been another pope since the middle ages who has had the kind of direct effect of world politics or who has contributed to the political liberation of so many people . " the slovaks belong to that group .
the head of the catholic church visited slovakia three times .
it is a small country , with a big catholic tradition ; 60 percent of the population is catholic .
the pope visited all the large cities of the country and took the opportunity to speak with the people directly - particularly the young . " when i met the holy father , i knew that we are not alone in this world , " said 22-year-old juraj .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 02.04.2005 title hopes for bremen now zero großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's ernst , white , looks sharp but his side was clumsy in 2-1 loss reigning champs werder bremen had lost to schalke and bayern munich in the second leg .
to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .
matthias sammer 's boys can stir things up in the title chase next week .
they face schalke .
bremen for their part have to look behind them some .
they lie in fourth place on 47 points but two of their pursuers , hamburg and leverkusen stumbled with a draw and a loss respectively .

" it is good news for all honest taxpayers , " barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , said in a statement last week .
though germans are typically thought to fill out every form in minute detail , tax offices estimate evasion through misleading filings cost the government millions of euros every year .
the government has not announced how much tax revenue it hopes to recoup using the new law .
law trades amnesty for prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evasion is estimated to cost germany millions in lost revenue a 15-month tax amnesty law , aimed at bringing money in foreign banks back to germany , brought 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- into the treasury 's coffers , much less than the 5 billion euros german finance minister hans eichel had hoped .
the new law for tax honesty , which began as a way of combating money laundering for terrorism after sept .
11 attacks in the united states , developed a central processing system that allowed government investigators a look at account data in the country 's 2,400 banks .
as quick as google ?
tax investigators as well as social and welfare officials now will be able to use the system to determine what types of accounts a person has .
" now it 's like google , " said thomas schluter , a spokesman for the federal association of german banks .
" they put in a name and date of birth , and out comes the information . "
government officials say the process is much more arduous and is closely monitored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker was sentenced to two years ' probation for tax evasion and fined for 300,000 euros in 2002 when an account sparks investigators interest , the first step is to confront the owners with their suspicions , allowing them to answer the inquiries .
if investigators remain apprehensive , the next step is to fill out the required form , either by hand or with a typewriter , get a supervisor 's signature and post the form to a central agency in berlin " a clerk who does this much work , only does it when he has a good reason for it , " nikolaus gross of munich 's main tax office told the süddeutsche zeitung friday .
german funds deposited abroad competitive pressure from other international banks is leaving some german institutions wondering if they 'll lose customers to switzerland , luxembourg and austria . " it 's a clear weakening of germany 's status as a financial center , " hermann burbaum , head of the volksbank raesfeld , who challenged the law in germany 's highest court last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's ubs bank wo n't be a safe haven for german funds when eu rules go into effect austrian newspapers estimate that germans have deposited between 50 billion euros and 70 billion euros in the southern neighbor , where they are more than welcome .
" we all profit from this , " austrian-state bank association head josef kassler .
" and we do n't even have to advertise much for it . "
still , austria and other european countries will only be a temporary solution for wealthy germans looking to avoid the 42-percent top tax bracket .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 02.04.2005 bundesliga finally focuses on rising east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : takahara : hamburg 's ticket to the japanese market years after teams from england , italy and spain , the german bundesliga is finally beginning to discover the potential of the asian market .
but is there enough room for them ? on a recent trip to china , rainer kübler was stunned at the amount of soccer the billion-strong country watches . highlights from the english , spanish and italian leagues were broadcast almost around the clock .
only one of europe 's major leagues was conspicuous in its infrequency : the bundesliga . " we are far behind the others , " said kübler , who two years ago became the asia point man for the berlin soccer club hertha bsc . unlike the continent 's other big leagues , germany 's top division has only recently begun taking a serious look at the rapidly expanding chinese market and its massive pool of young talent .
two years ago , 1860 munich signed the first chinese player in the bundesliga .
last year , their cross-town rivals , fc bayern munich planned a tour of chinese cities that they only cancelled because of the sars scare .
they plan to try the tour again this year , and will be shadowed by hamburg sv , one of the league 's most asia ambitious clubs . new sources of income " teams are permanently looking for new sources of financing and with the domestic market exploited , they need to look across borders for other possibilities , " says manfred schubert , lecturer at the cologne sports academy . with a market in east asia estimated at 3.5 billion people , an increasing number of them massive soccer fans , one wonders why they did n't move earlier .
the premiere league estimates that 500 million people in asia follow the matches on english soil every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of real madrid holding up a poster of real madrid 's david beckham cheer as they watch the team training in hong kong 's stadium . teams like manchester united and newcastle united regularly make trips to the middle kingdom and other asian countries .
when spain 's superstar team , real madrid , toured there in the summer of 2003 , television cameras followed david beckham and co . 's every move and teenagers and fans crushed against police barriers surrounding their practice facilities . with no beckham at their disposal and no aggressive marketing campaign by individual teams , the bundesliga has had a very difficult time abroad .
recent figures by the hamburg marketing firm sport five show that the bundesliga is far behind the three major european soccer leagues in terms of video footage sold .
last season , the premiership earned 150 million euros -lrb- $ 193 million -rrb- for their game footage abroad .
italy 's serie a followed with 65 million euros and spain 's primera division with 35 million euros . hertha 's xu addition the bundesliga earned 12 million euros . " we have been sleeping , " on the job , said kübler . two years ago , hertha began getting serious about recruiting an asian player and appointed kübler to head its newly-created asia department .
together with other team officials , kübler made several trips to china in the past year , observing teenage talent across the country and running clinics . the hard work has already paid dividends .
beginning next week , xu zhan , a 17-year-old striker talent from peking will begin training with hertha 's amateur team . the club signed him to a three-year contract after bringing him in for a one month trial last november .
" we wanted to get an asian player , " said kübler .
" we are convinced that the asian soccer market is the future , especially with regard to players . " winning over asian fans , one player at a time such players also give german clubs instant name recognition and offer a relatively inexpensive way to market themselves abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with japan already under their belts , thanks to takahara , hamburg is concentrating on china . " hsv did that by signing -lrb- striker naohiro -rrb- takahara , and the japanese market opened up for them , " said schubert .
" i assume other teams will use that method more often in the future . " the interest is n't one-sided .
in preparation for hosting the 2008 olympics in beijing , china , which missed out on qualifying for the world cup in germany next year , wants its young soccer talent in top shape .

but is there enough room for them ? on a recent trip to china , rainer kübler was stunned at the amount of soccer the billion-strong country watches . highlights from the english , spanish and italian leagues were broadcast almost around the clock .
only one of europe 's major leagues was conspicuous in its infrequency : the bundesliga . " we are far behind the others , " said kübler , who two years ago became the asia point man for the berlin soccer club hertha bsc . unlike the continent 's other big leagues , germany 's top division has only recently begun taking a serious look at the rapidly expanding chinese market and its massive pool of young talent .
two years ago , 1860 munich signed the first chinese player in the bundesliga .
last year , their cross-town rivals , fc bayern munich planned a tour of chinese cities that they only cancelled because of the sars scare .
they plan to try the tour again this year , and will be shadowed by hamburg sv , one of the league 's most asia ambitious clubs . new sources of income " teams are permanently looking for new sources of financing and with the domestic market exploited , they need to look across borders for other possibilities , " says manfred schubert , lecturer at the cologne sports academy . with a market in east asia estimated at 3.5 billion people , an increasing number of them massive soccer fans , one wonders why they did n't move earlier .
the premiere league estimates that 500 million people in asia follow the matches on english soil every week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans of real madrid holding up a poster of real madrid 's david beckham cheer as they watch the team training in hong kong 's stadium . teams like manchester united and newcastle united regularly make trips to the middle kingdom and other asian countries .
when spain 's superstar team , real madrid , toured there in the summer of 2003 , television cameras followed david beckham and co . 's every move and teenagers and fans crushed against police barriers surrounding their practice facilities . with no beckham at their disposal and no aggressive marketing campaign by individual teams , the bundesliga has had a very difficult time abroad .
recent figures by the hamburg marketing firm sport five show that the bundesliga is far behind the three major european soccer leagues in terms of video footage sold .
last season , the premiership earned 150 million euros -lrb- $ 193 million -rrb- for their game footage abroad .
italy 's serie a followed with 65 million euros and spain 's primera division with 35 million euros . hertha 's xu addition the bundesliga earned 12 million euros . " we have been sleeping , " on the job , said kübler . two years ago , hertha began getting serious about recruiting an asian player and appointed kübler to head its newly-created asia department .
together with other team officials , kübler made several trips to china in the past year , observing teenage talent across the country and running clinics . the hard work has already paid dividends .
beginning next week , xu zhan , a 17-year-old striker talent from peking will begin training with hertha 's amateur team . the club signed him to a three-year contract after bringing him in for a one month trial last november .
" we wanted to get an asian player , " said kübler .
" we are convinced that the asian soccer market is the future , especially with regard to players . " winning over asian fans , one player at a time such players also give german clubs instant name recognition and offer a relatively inexpensive way to market themselves abroad . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with japan already under their belts , thanks to takahara , hamburg is concentrating on china . " hsv did that by signing -lrb- striker naohiro -rrb- takahara , and the japanese market opened up for them , " said schubert .
" i assume other teams will use that method more often in the future . " the interest is n't one-sided .
in preparation for hosting the 2008 olympics in beijing , china , which missed out on qualifying for the world cup in germany next year , wants its young soccer talent in top shape .
when the chinese soccer federation began casting about for locations in europe to set up a soccer academy to train their teen talents a year ago , they settled on bad kissingen , a small town in bavaria mostly known for its spas , which beat out locations france and spain . china 's germany fascination " there is already strong partnerships between germany and china , and bavaria and china , " said bad kissinger mayor heinz laudenbach .

" it is good news for all honest taxpayers , " barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , said in a statement last week .
though germans are typically thought to fill out every form in minute detail , tax offices estimate evasion through misleading filings cost the government millions of euros every year .
the government has not announced how much tax revenue it hopes to recoup using the new law .
law trades amnesty for prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evasion is estimated to cost germany millions in lost revenue a 15-month tax amnesty law , aimed at bringing money in foreign banks back to germany , brought 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- into the treasury 's coffers , much less than the 5 billion euros german finance minister hans eichel had hoped .
the new law for tax honesty , which began as a way of combating money laundering for terrorism after sept .
11 attacks in the united states , developed a central processing system that allowed government investigators a look at account data in the country 's 2,400 banks .
as quick as google ?
tax investigators as well as social and welfare officials now will be able to use the system to determine what types of accounts a person has .
" now it 's like google , " said thomas schluter , a spokesman for the federal association of german banks .
" they put in a name and date of birth , and out comes the information . "
government officials say the process is much more arduous and is closely monitored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker was sentenced to two years ' probation for tax evasion and fined for 300,000 euros in 2002 when an account sparks investigators interest , the first step is to confront the owners with their suspicions , allowing them to answer the inquiries .
if investigators remain apprehensive , the next step is to fill out the required form , either by hand or with a typewriter , get a supervisor 's signature and post the form to a central agency in berlin " a clerk who does this much work , only does it when he has a good reason for it , " nikolaus gross of munich 's main tax office told the süddeutsche zeitung friday .
german funds deposited abroad competitive pressure from other international banks is leaving some german institutions wondering if they 'll lose customers to switzerland , luxembourg and austria . " it 's a clear weakening of germany 's status as a financial center , " hermann burbaum , head of the volksbank raesfeld , who challenged the law in germany 's highest court last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's ubs bank wo n't be a safe haven for german funds when eu rules go into effect austrian newspapers estimate that germans have deposited between 50 billion euros and 70 billion euros in the southern neighbor , where they are more than welcome .

" it is good news for all honest taxpayers , " barbara hendricks , a deputy finance minister , said in a statement last week .
though germans are typically thought to fill out every form in minute detail , tax offices estimate evasion through misleading filings cost the government millions of euros every year .
the government has not announced how much tax revenue it hopes to recoup using the new law .
law trades amnesty for prosecution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax evasion is estimated to cost germany millions in lost revenue a 15-month tax amnesty law , aimed at bringing money in foreign banks back to germany , brought 1.2 million euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- into the treasury 's coffers , much less than the 5 billion euros german finance minister hans eichel had hoped .
the new law for tax honesty , which began as a way of combating money laundering for terrorism after sept .
11 attacks in the united states , developed a central processing system that allowed government investigators a look at account data in the country 's 2,400 banks .
as quick as google ?
tax investigators as well as social and welfare officials now will be able to use the system to determine what types of accounts a person has .
" now it 's like google , " said thomas schluter , a spokesman for the federal association of german banks .
" they put in a name and date of birth , and out comes the information . "
government officials say the process is much more arduous and is closely monitored .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german tennis star boris becker was sentenced to two years ' probation for tax evasion and fined for 300,000 euros in 2002 when an account sparks investigators interest , the first step is to confront the owners with their suspicions , allowing them to answer the inquiries .
if investigators remain apprehensive , the next step is to fill out the required form , either by hand or with a typewriter , get a supervisor 's signature and post the form to a central agency in berlin " a clerk who does this much work , only does it when he has a good reason for it , " nikolaus gross of munich 's main tax office told the süddeutsche zeitung friday .
german funds deposited abroad competitive pressure from other international banks is leaving some german institutions wondering if they 'll lose customers to switzerland , luxembourg and austria . " it 's a clear weakening of germany 's status as a financial center , " hermann burbaum , head of the volksbank raesfeld , who challenged the law in germany 's highest court last week .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : switzerland 's ubs bank wo n't be a safe haven for german funds when eu rules go into effect austrian newspapers estimate that germans have deposited between 50 billion euros and 70 billion euros in the southern neighbor , where they are more than welcome .

" in late morning a high fever developed .

that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .

to keep alive the dream of a title repeat , a victory was necessary against their nearest rivals stuttgart .
instead , they lost 2-1 . a disastrous second half and the failure to capitalize on some first-half chances just may have buried werder bremen 's aspirations to repeat as bundesliga champions this season .
thomas schaaf 's side had to beat vfb , but after conceding the game-winning goal in the 87th minute , the northern germans now must be very concerned about making it to the champions league next season .
the turning point may well have been a very sloppy foul committed by valerien ismael in the 84th minute .
in a relatively harmless situation , bremen 's defensive anchorman slid into stranzl and he saw his second yellow card .
three minutes later , stuttgart took advantage of a disorganized bremen defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's soccer player frank fahrenhorst , right , and stuttgart 's player kevin kuranyi challenge for the ball .
kuranyi has not scored for stuttgart since the 20th game vfb 's star midfielder aleksander hleb found striker kevin kuranyi alone in the penalty box .
he unleashed a shot that werder keeper reinke could save but christian tiffert gathered the loose ball , evaded a reeling reinke and deposited the ball into the empty net .
it likened the death toll for bremen 's championship hopes .
bremen came tantalizingly close to getting the equalizer two minutes later but stuttgart 's goalie timo hildebrand saved a header on the line that was bound for the net .
first half yawner , second half goals the 42,000 fans in weser stadium were witness to some unappetizing soccer in the first half .
stuttgart circled the wagons in their own end and ventured only a few times into the bremen half .
the hosts for their part missed a couple of high percentage chances in the first 15 minutes and most every player knows the price that is paid when you do n't score on such occasions .
" we had the chances in the first half , " goalkeeper andreas reinke told tv broadcaster premiere , " but we did n't score . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's tim borowski and christian schulz fight for the ball with stuttgart 's christian tiffert , from left .
tiffert would score the winning goal just minutes before the final whistle stuttgart did - in the second half .
matthias sammer 's side came out of the locker room and opened the scoring in the 48th minute .
on a corner kick , the bremen defense , normally solidly dependable and the second-best in the league , was asleep .
tim borowski let his man , silvio meissner , slip in front of him and the veteran midfielder sank the ball into the net .
bremen did n't take long to respond .
just four minutes after falling behind , bremen 's star croatian striker ivan klasnic beat the stuttgart offside trap , took a pass from daniel jensen inside the box and squeezed the ball between a charging hildebrand and the right goalpost .
stuttgart keep up with leaders the three points for stuttgart mean that they stay within shouting distance of the bundesliga 's top teams , bayern munich and schalke 04 , who both won .
matthias sammer 's boys can stir things up in the title chase next week .
they face schalke .
bremen for their part have to look behind them some .
they lie in fourth place on 47 points but two of their pursuers , hamburg and leverkusen stumbled with a draw and a loss respectively .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .
when addressed by members of his household , he responds correctly . "
earlier saturday , vatican spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said the 84-year-old pope 's overall heart and breathing conditions had not changed and remained " very serious . " tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .
in an indication of the pontiff 's worsening health , a mass was celebrated saturday morning in the pope 's presence , but significantly he did not take an active role in the ceremony as he had the day before . bildunterschrift : thousands of people pray in on st. peter 's square at the vatican saturday navarro-valls said in a statement : " the general , cardio-respiratory and metabolic conditions of the holy father are substantially unchanged and therefore are very serious . "
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "
the next vatican 's statement on the pope 's condition is n't expected until sunday morning .

cardinal joseph ratzinger said after visiting the pontiff early saturday that he " knows he is dying and said his last goodbye " to the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , according to sky italia television . another visitor , italian cardinal achille silvestrini , said the pope " gave signs of recognizing people .
" i saw him very relaxed , " he said , adding he had prayed beside the pope and kissed his hand . the pontiff also appointed two new archbishops and papal ambassadors and accepted the resignations of three other prelates , approved last month , the vatican said saturday .
the previous day , he had appointed 17 new bishops and accepted the resignation of six others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls from spain in a communique issued shortly before 1900 cet on friday , navarro-valls -lrb- photo -rrb- said the pontiff 's condition was worsening , his breathing had become shallow and his blood pressure was falling . doctors surprised " the pope has an extraordinary physique , and at the moment even his doctors are surprised " at his will to live , said corrado manni , an anaesthetist who has been present at several of the pope 's 10 surgical operations .
" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .
" i was captured by the beauty of this smiling look .
he clearly wanted me to understand that he recognized me , " pompedda told the daily la repubblica . obituary appears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the faithful pray in cologne cathedral on friday many newspapers , however , already spoke of the pontiff in the past tense .
the turin daily la stampa even published a full obituary on its front page , entitled " john paul ii 1978-2005 . " the pontiff , who has parkinson 's disease , severe lung and throat problems and has long been confined to a wheelchair , suddenly took a sharp turn for the worse late thursday , when he was given the last rites . the crowd in st peter 's square swelled to nearly 70,000 at one point after midnight friday , but as the hours passed the numbers dwindled to several hundred gazing up at the pope 's windows . a revolutionary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two girls protect a candle flame as faithful gather for prayers in st. peter 's square at the vatican on friday across the world , from his native poland to indonesia , from the americas to the middle east , millions of others also prayed for a pontiff who has led the roman catholic church for more than a quarter of a century . born karol wojtyla in a small town near cracow , southern poland , he is the first non-italian pope in more than four centuries and the 263rd successor to saint peter - one of the disciples of jesus - as bishop of rome .
elected pontiff in 1978 at the age of 58 , he revolutionized the papacy and contributed to the collapse of communism in eastern europe . but he also alienated many catholics with his conservative social views , especially dealing with sex in a world struggling with aids . in poland , the press prepared for the death of their countryman .

" the clinical conditions of the holy father remain very serious , " the vatican said in a brief statement issued around 1930 cet .
" in late morning a high fever developed .

" tens of thousands of pilgrims had maintained a vigil for the dying pope in st peter 's square well into the early hours , overlooked by the apartment of the leader of the world 's 1.1 billion roman catholics .

"
as of dawn saturday , the pope appeared to be moving in and out of consciousness , he said . navarro-valls said in answer to questions that " we noticed a reduction in his consciousness .
that absolutely does not mean , technically , that he is in a state of coma .
" when spoken to , he opens his eyes and remains conscious .
at times it seems he is sleeping or that he is resting his eyes . "

" i believed that , given the conditions described in the medical bulletin , yesterday he was nearly finished , but he 's still not .
" that 's surprised everyone a little , even me who has known him well for so long , " the doctor said . the pope was lying under white blankets in the center of his room , propped up by pillows , according to cardinal mario francesco pompedda who went to see him on friday .

on oct .
16 , 1978 , the former archbishop of cracow became the first non-italian pontiff in over 450 years and history 's first slavic pope .
during his more than 20 years as the head of the vatican , pope john paul ii steered the catholic church through turbulent times and influenced the image of the papacy more than any other recent pope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 19-year old karol wojtyla -lrb- bare-chested at right -rrb- , the to-be pope john paul ii , during the construction of a building for a military camp in this july 1939 with his globetrotting and visits to more than 100 countries , he increased the international presence and clout of the papacy and drew attention to human rights and world peace .
in the minds of both critics and supporters , pope john paul ii was intrinsically connected with the catholic church 's struggle with reform as he continued to defend conservative positions on pressing social issues such as abortion , contraception and homosexuality . restoring the church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karol wojtyla , right , archbishop of krakow , poland is shown on a visit to the united states in sept .

on oct .
16 , 1978 , the former archbishop of cracow became the first non-italian pontiff in over 450 years and history 's first slavic pope .
during his more than 20 years as the head of the vatican , pope john paul ii steered the catholic church through turbulent times and influenced the image of the papacy more than any other recent pope . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a 19-year old karol wojtyla -lrb- bare-chested at right -rrb- , the to-be pope john paul ii , during the construction of a building for a military camp in this july 1939 with his globetrotting and visits to more than 100 countries , he increased the international presence and clout of the papacy and drew attention to human rights and world peace .
in the minds of both critics and supporters , pope john paul ii was intrinsically connected with the catholic church 's struggle with reform as he continued to defend conservative positions on pressing social issues such as abortion , contraception and homosexuality . restoring the church bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal karol wojtyla , right , archbishop of krakow , poland is shown on a visit to the united states in sept .

1969 pope john paul ii 's election to the papacy was largely the result of disunity among the italian cardinals who were unable to agree on a candidate from among their own ranks and thus turned to the pole who had already made a name for himself with his radiant charisma , intellect , and not last , his robust health . although the catholic church today undoubtedly bears the markings of pope john paul ii and his conservative position , it was not always that way .

it did away with the latin mass and introduced a new collegial church leadership .
the new worldliness was not without its consequences , however .
theologians began to question religious doctrines , catholics ignored the ban on contraception , and in latin america , the clergy started to forge ties to marxism . the vatican responded by introducing a period of restoration , which reached its highpoint in the " humanae vitae , " a papal writing which said contraception went against the teachings of the catholic church .

" in the east , atheist regimes left behind a spiritual wasteland , while in the west a disproportionate focus on capitalism threatens to choke the spiritual values of a whole civilization , " he once said , endearing himself to the opponents of communism and globalization . the pope 's unflagging appeal for mutual respect among the world 's religions was a grand gesture in the name of peace .
he set himself apart from his predecessors by seeking an ecumenical dialogue with protestant leaders and by becoming the first pope to visit a synagogue and a mosque .
his effort to bring together religious leaders from around the world in assisi in the name of peace was a milestone in the history of civilization . a " giant among the giants " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pope leans on his crozier in 1999 even though opinions about john paul ii differed ; he will undoubtedly go down in history as a pope of superlatives and a towering figure at the moral center of modern life .

the lumpsucker is on show at underwater world , hastings , after being treated for the " bends " - a condition suffered by divers who surface too quickly .
lumpsuckers are found all around the british isles and can reach 2ft in length when fully grown .
aquarist dan davies said it was touch and go when local fishermen found the adult female two weeks ago .
football-shaped fish " she was in a sorry state when she was brought in and it was touch and go at one point , " he said .
female lumpsuckers lay between 100,000 and 400,000 eggs at a time which are often sold as imitation caviar , aquarists at the centre said .
the football-shaped fish has a suction cup on its underside which can be used to cling onto rocks to stop it being carried away by strong currents .
staff at the aquarium admitted to bbc southern counties radio that their latest exhibit was unlikely to win any prizes for beauty .

dr rod williams is among more than 260 volunteers who will be tested .
dr williams , who used to run a business making millions of pounds , believes the illness which has stopped him working is down to electromagnetic waves .
if researchers find a link , the medical profession will have to recognise that electromagnetic hypersensitivity syndrome exists .
it specialist dr williams , 39 , of braintree , essex , began feeling unwell seven years ago . "
if you have a business meeting you ca n't make decisions or work you way through issues ... it is totally debilitating " dr ron williams his job meant he has had a high exposure to mobile phones and lcd screens and he originally thought his illness was the early symptoms of the onset of alzheimer 's disease .
" it affects where you can go because if you go to an environment where a lot of people are using mobile phones , i will get a headache immediately after that .
" if you turn up somewhere and have a business meeting you ca n't make decisions or work you way through issues .
it is totally debilitating . "
now he can only use a computer because he has swapped a monitor for a projector and uses an infra-red keyboard .
in the study participants sit surrounded by pyramid-shaped foam which absorbs radio frequencies .
the mast sits behind a screen .
blood pressure and stress levels are monitored while the participants complete basic tasks during four sessions .
neither they nor the researcher knows whether the mast is turned on or off each time .
dr stacy eltiti , of the university 's psychology department , said : " every five minutes we interrupt them and get them to tell us how they are feeling at that time so we can get a picture to see if there are any changes - and we are also doing the physiological measurements continuously . "

two lancaster university graduates are to interview 18 to 30-year-olds who went to school in the area and are still there or have moved away .
they will ask what they think of it as a place to live and what should be done to attract and keep young adults there .
the project is sponsored by west cumbria strategic partnership with westlakes research institute .
the researchers want to hear from people who went to school in maryport , cleator moor , whitehaven and workington who either still live in the area or moved away to study or work .
they also hope to speak to people who have moved into the area .
west cumbria partnership co-ordinator michael heaslip said : " we have a commitment from government to higher education in west cumbria and to new highly-skilled jobs in nuclear decommissioning and environmental technologies and that is vital - but will it be enough to attract young people , locals or from elsewhere to stay ?
" at the moment , west cumbria is haemorrhaging its youth , the lifeblood of the future .
" alongside the government commitment , what do we need to do ourselves locally to provide the kind of lifestyle and facilities that will keep people in the area ? "

the delicate question has been raised by the fragile condition of the 84-year-old pontiff .
he is now thought to be close to death , despite efforts by doctors in recent days to halt his decline .
a tracheotomy was performed to help him breathe , but it left him almost without the power of speech .
then , after concern over his loss of weight , doctors inserted a nasal feeding tube to allow him to receive nutrition .
but over the past 48 hours , there has been a dramatic worsening of his condition .
it is necessary to approach the ill with that healthy realism which avoids generating in those who suffer the illusion of medicine 's omnipotence pope john paul ii 2002 the pope has apparently refused the option of being taken back to hospital , and appears to be serenely waiting for death .
the measures used to treat the pope have given a new focus to discussions within the catholic church about the care of the dying .
euthanasia by omission it was the pope himself who re-opened the debate a year ago with remarks to a medical conference in rome .
speaking about the treatment of patients in a persistent vegetative state , he said that artificial feeding was " morally obligatory " .
providing food and water by tube was a natural means of preserving life , he argued , and not a medical act .
furthermore , he warned doctors , the removal of feeding tubes would be " euthanasia by omission " .
it is widely believed that john paul ii has written a letter authorising the church to hold an election if he becomes incapacitated .
peter gould the pope 's words caused a stir in the medical world , particularly in the 600 catholic-run hospitals in the united states .
many doctors had assumed that it was permissible to withdraw such treatment where there was no hope of recovery .
the pope 's words also created doubts about the ability of catholic doctors to comply with the terms of a " living will " in which the patient asks not to be resuscitated in the event of them slipping into a coma .
but while john paul ii defends the sanctity of human life , he has made it clear he is opposed to extreme measures being used to keep patients alive " at all costs " .
" it is necessary to approach the ill with that healthy realism which avoids generating in those who suffer the illusion of medicine 's omnipotence , " he said in 2002 .
no extremes in the united states , catholic doctors who care for the terminally ill have been given guidelines by the us conference of catholic bishops .
they have been told that the duty to preserve life is not absolute , and the patient may reject any procedure that is " insufficiently beneficial or excessively burdensome " .
but the bishops go on to warn that suicide and euthanasia are never morally acceptable options .
" physicians and their patients must evaluate the use of the technology at their disposal , " they say .
" the use of life-sustaining technology is judged in light of the christian meaning of life , suffering , and death .
" only in this way are two extremes avoided : on the one hand , an insistence on useless or burdensome technology even when a patient may legitimately wish to forgo it and , on the other hand , the withdrawal of technology with the intention of causing death . "
incapacity conundrum one unresolved issue is what would happen if the pope becomes incapacitated but remains alive .
who will then decide what to do ?
" the same moral rules apply to the pope as to anyone else , " says father thomas reese , editor of the religious journal america .
the same moral rules apply to the pope as to anyone else father thomas reese editor , religious journal america " his situation is problematic because he does not have a living relative and church law does not say who would make medical decisions for him if he is unconscious .
" whether he has a living will or not is unknown , but his statement of a year ago on these issues would have to be respected as an indication of his will .
" in the past , most moralists would have considered feeding tubes a medical intervention like a respirator .
" if a person is going to get better , obviously you do not disconnect them .
if they are dying , you do not have to keep them connected .
the disputed issue is a person in a persistent vegetative state .
" the pope now says they should continue to receive liquids and nourishment . "
it is widely believed that john paul ii has written a letter authorising the church to hold an election if he becomes incapacitated .
but has he left instructions over the medical options open to his doctors ?
we simply do not know , and the church remains in a state of uncertainty over the health of its ailing pope .

the measures used to treat the pope have given a new focus to discussions within the catholic church about the care of the dying .
euthanasia by omission it was the pope himself who re-opened the debate a year ago with remarks to a medical conference in rome .
speaking about the treatment of patients in a persistent vegetative state , he said that artificial feeding was " morally obligatory " .
providing food and water by tube was a natural means of preserving life , he argued , and not a medical act .
furthermore , he warned doctors , the removal of feeding tubes would be " euthanasia by omission " .
it is widely believed that john paul ii has written a letter authorising the church to hold an election if he becomes incapacitated .
peter gould the pope 's words caused a stir in the medical world , particularly in the 600 catholic-run hospitals in the united states .
many doctors had assumed that it was permissible to withdraw such treatment where there was no hope of recovery .
the pope 's words also created doubts about the ability of catholic doctors to comply with the terms of a " living will " in which the patient asks not to be resuscitated in the event of them slipping into a coma .
but while john paul ii defends the sanctity of human life , he has made it clear he is opposed to extreme measures being used to keep patients alive " at all costs " .
" it is necessary to approach the ill with that healthy realism which avoids generating in those who suffer the illusion of medicine 's omnipotence , " he said in 2002 .
no extremes in the united states , catholic doctors who care for the terminally ill have been given guidelines by the us conference of catholic bishops .
they have been told that the duty to preserve life is not absolute , and the patient may reject any procedure that is " insufficiently beneficial or excessively burdensome " .
but the bishops go on to warn that suicide and euthanasia are never morally acceptable options .
" physicians and their patients must evaluate the use of the technology at their disposal , " they say .
" the use of life-sustaining technology is judged in light of the christian meaning of life , suffering , and death .
" only in this way are two extremes avoided : on the one hand , an insistence on useless or burdensome technology even when a patient may legitimately wish to forgo it and , on the other hand , the withdrawal of technology with the intention of causing death . "

ministers have revealed that the on-the-spot fines , aimed at cracking down on binge drinking , will be introduced on monday .
but some pub managers are sceptical over the ability to enforce the fines , saying stricter guidelines are needed .
a fine for children caught buying alcohol will also be introduced .
the conservatives and lib dems argue the measures are not enough to tackle the problem .
they have also called for a delay on the government 's 24-hour drinking plans .
' clear message ' police can already impose on-the spot fines on those who are drunk and disorderly .
if the law is broken , both parties must pay a price tessa jowell culture secretary tessa jowell said the fine expansions " send out a clear message " .
" if the law is broken , both parties must pay a price , " she said .
" along with tough measures in the licensing act , these new penalty notices will give police further tools to tackle alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder head-on . "
the result would be more freedom for responsible adults and tougher treatment " for the yobbish minority " , she added .
strict guidelines industry reaction has revealed sceptism at the ability of the law to be enforced .
mark hastings , from the british beer and pub association , said police had not put enforcement " at the top of their priority list " .
he told the bbc news website : " the key here is enforcement and ensuring that the law is enforced with rigour .
" we 'd also like to see the same steps taken against drunks themselves . "
kevin beswick , manager at the bridge pub in manchester , said one problem was a lack of strict guidelines .
" one person could drink ten drinks and appear sober while another could be falling over .
it 's very hard to gage , " he said .
how do you tell when someone 's drunk ?
we 're not medically trained andy mcintyre he said the key was staff training : " i 've made my staff aware that they 're liable personally . "
andy mcintyre , manager of the market place in london , said enforcing the law was " difficult " .
he said : " how do you tell when someone 's drunk ?
we 're not medically trained . "
" you 're paying your staff to serve drinks and make as much money as possible , you 're not going to fine them for serving alcohol if that 's what they 're paid for . "
the government hopes 24-hour licensing could come into operation from november .
' more police ' opposition parties say it is the wider policies on drinking that need to be reconsidered and a few extra on-the-spot fines will make little difference .
a conservative spokesman said : " we need far more police on our streets and in out towns and in our cities . "
a spokesman for the lib dems said : " make the punishment something that matters .
" just having to pay £ 50 is something the very rich can do very easily and something quite a lot of people may forget after a fortnight . "

ministers have revealed that the on-the-spot fines , aimed at cracking down on binge drinking , will be introduced on monday .
but some pub managers are sceptical over the ability to enforce the fines , saying stricter guidelines are needed .
a fine for children caught buying alcohol will also be introduced .
the conservatives and lib dems argue the measures are not enough to tackle the problem .
they have also called for a delay on the government 's 24-hour drinking plans .
' clear message ' police can already impose on-the spot fines on those who are drunk and disorderly .
if the law is broken , both parties must pay a price tessa jowell culture secretary tessa jowell said the fine expansions " send out a clear message " .
" if the law is broken , both parties must pay a price , " she said .
" along with tough measures in the licensing act , these new penalty notices will give police further tools to tackle alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder head-on . "
the result would be more freedom for responsible adults and tougher treatment " for the yobbish minority " , she added .
strict guidelines industry reaction has revealed sceptism at the ability of the law to be enforced .
mark hastings , from the british beer and pub association , said police had not put enforcement " at the top of their priority list " .
he told the bbc news website : " the key here is enforcement and ensuring that the law is enforced with rigour .
" we 'd also like to see the same steps taken against drunks themselves . "
kevin beswick , manager at the bridge pub in manchester , said one problem was a lack of strict guidelines .
" one person could drink ten drinks and appear sober while another could be falling over .
it 's very hard to gage , " he said .
how do you tell when someone 's drunk ?
we 're not medically trained andy mcintyre he said the key was staff training : " i 've made my staff aware that they 're liable personally . "
andy mcintyre , manager of the market place in london , said enforcing the law was " difficult " .
he said : " how do you tell when someone 's drunk ?
we 're not medically trained . "
" you 're paying your staff to serve drinks and make as much money as possible , you 're not going to fine them for serving alcohol if that 's what they 're paid for . "
the government hopes 24-hour licensing could come into operation from november .
' more police ' opposition parties say it is the wider policies on drinking that need to be reconsidered and a few extra on-the-spot fines will make little difference .
a conservative spokesman said : " we need far more police on our streets and in out towns and in our cities . "

her husband wanted her to be allowed to die , but her parents fought against it and received support from the most powerful americans in the land .
terri schiavo died 13 days after her feeding tubes had been removed in all the three years that i have been reporting from this country , i do not believe there has been a more important moment in its history than this .
or an issue that illuminates the complex and vital soul of america as the terri schiavo case does .
it transcends the presidential election , the iraq war , the rows over gay marriage and television nudity and all the other stuff , consequential , inconsequential and downright weird , which counts as " news about america " .
the reason the schiavo case is so important , the reason it has americans talking and arguing , and the reason it should , in my view , have the rest of us re-assessing our view of this nation , is that americans were corralled but rebelled .
they were emotionally blackmailed but refused to budge , were told that their deepest held religious beliefs should push them in one direction , but thought for themselves and thought differently .
america is often portrayed as an ignorant , unsophisticated sort of place , full of bible bashers and ruled to a dangerous extent by trashy television , superstition and religious bigotry , a place lacking in respect for evidence based knowledge .
i know that is how it is portrayed because i have done my bit to paint that picture , and that picture is in many respects a true one .
disagreement look no further than the $ 25m creationist museum which is about to open in kentucky .
terri schiavo case feb 1990 : terri schiavo collapses may 1998 : mr schiavo files petition to remove feeding tube oct 2003 : florida lower house passes " terri 's law " , allowing governor to order doctors to feed mrs schiavo sept 2004 : florida supreme court strikes down law 18 mar 2005 : florida court allows removal of tube 22 mar 2005 : federal judge rejects appeal 23 mar 2005 : appeals court backs federal ruling 29 mar 2005 : federal court grants parents leave to appeal 30 mar 2005 : federal court and supreme court reject parents ' appeal 31 mar 2005 : terri schiavo dies q & a : terri schiavo case complete with models of adam and eve being chased by dinosaurs , surely some mistake , and explanations of aids that blame the disease on homosexuality .
there is plenty of barminess and plenty of nastiness here if you look for it , but for me , the revelation of the schiavo case was that there is plenty of good sense as well .
plenty of honest disagreement among reasonable people , religious and non religious , republican and democrat .
and in the end a majority who value what we can call , without irony , the american way of life , and believe their politicians and the right-to-life campaigners over-reached themselves in this case .
remember that two weeks ago , america 's congress interrupted its holiday and in solemn session convened in washington to change the law in order that terri schiavo 's feeding tube should be reinserted .
the president himself brought air force one back from texas in order that he could sleep at the white house , and get up at one o ' clock in the morning to sign the new law in his pyjamas .
right to live as these events were happening , there were heart-rending pleas from mrs schiavo 's parents who were genuinely convinced that their daughter wanted to live and might get better .
and exhortations from the religious right that this was the moment america could define itself as genuinely culturally conservative .
mrs schiavo had been at the heart of a seven-year court battle proof of all those claims which were made after the re-election of mr bush , that a new dawn had come .
and for good measure , twenty-four hours a day , the television news showed pictures of terri schiavo looking responsive , even affectionate , and above all looking vulnerable .
what did americans make of this ?
well , i do not think its cynical to say the politicians would not have acted as they did , without some fairly strong belief that they would be backed and thanked by a grateful nation .
and at the time , i would have bet any money on that outcome .
but it did not happen and the reasons why it did not happen go to the heart of this wonderfully surprising place .
americans do believe in god and they do believe in life , but they also believe in law , and rules , and the need for democracy to restrain , not satisfy , the wishes of politicians .
democracy the founding fathers , with a wisdom which truly does echo down the ages , decided that there would be a separation of powers .
general laws would be made by politicians representing the people , but then interpreted and applied by judges .
the founding fathers must be watching from their heavenly perches and wondering at the power of the constitution they created the reason is simple , to limit the power of government to interfere in any individuals life .
if you can convince the courts that you are legally in the right , then no politician , even the president himself in his pyjamas and on his high horse , can stop you .
michael schiavo , terri schiavo 's much vilified husband , did convince the courts .
he believed that his wife would want to die and they agreed .
it is a lesson the republican party , which has allowed itself to become very closely allied with the religious right , will reflect on in the months ahead .
already moderate republicans are talking openly of re-capturing their party from the social conservatives .
it is possible at least that the high watermark of social conservatism has been reached .
its limit set by the will of a silent liberal majority .
the founding fathers must be watching from their heavenly perches and wondering at the power of the constitution they created .
it is common to mock at american attempts to export jeffersonian democracy , but after these two weeks the mocking should stop .

the italian maestro , who has held the post since 1986 , said his resignation was " an obligatory choice " .
the resignation comes after more than 700 orchestra members and staff demanded mr muti step down last month .
the conflict , over the sacking of a senior la scala official , prompted a slew of cancelled performances .
concern among staff was prompted by the dismissal in february of carlo fontana - who had headed the theatre since 1990 .
the theatre board cited " differences " with mr muti .

researchers said people had already responded to their appeal for help from descendants of those killed .
for years the total was put at 57 , but members of the local queensferry history group now believe the toll is closer to 80 .
the youngest person to die during the construction of the bridge was only 13 .
working conditions were generally dangerous , because nothing like today 's safety regulations were in force .
some victims ' descendants have offered information to the history group after it made a plea for help last month .
local workers the group has also received inquiries from people seeking the updated list of names of the dead , who ranged from " rivet catchers " to painters and mostly came from britain or ireland .
some were recruited from communities close to both ends of the world-famous victorian bridge linking south queensferry and fife .
german engineer wilhelm westhofen kept a tally of those who died , but the historians believe there has been a cover-up .
the one-and-a-half mile bridge is made up of 55,000 tons of steel , 18,000 cubic metres of granite and eight million rivets .
construction began in 1883 and at its peak 4,600 men worked on the link .
the crossing , which usually caters for 50 freight and passenger trains daily , is to be closed in the summer for extensive steel blasting and painting work .

anyone with a child born on 1 september , 2002 , or later , should by now have received a voucher for at least £ 250 .
from wednesday , 6 april , they can invest this money in a child trust fund .
they have to decide between putting it in a deposit account and investing it on the stock market .
cash deals are very good at the moment , according to philip pearson from southampton-based ifas p & p invest .
he told money box on bbc radio 4 : " there are some very good interest rates for the deposit accounts .
" nationwide is offering 6 % for parents who are prepared to put the voucher in and top it up by another £ 250 a year .
" now a 6 % return is exceptional when you consider that inflation is around 2 % , and there 's no investment risk , and there are no ongoing charges to run the plan . "
limiting risk non-stakeholder investments are for individuals who have investment experience philip pearson , p & p invest mr pearson said parents who wanted to take a risk with their child 's money , in the hope of a better return , should spread that risk .
and generally that means a stakeholder fund where risk is limited .
" the abbey are offering a balanced international fund which tracks various stockmarkets around the world , " he said .
" so you diversify the child 's investment across the uk and international markets . "
parents , grandparents or anyone else can put a total of £ 1200 a year extra into the child trust fund , which grows tax-free .
and some parents who are experienced in managing investments might consider taking even more risk , choosing where the money is invested in detail themselves .
but phillip pearson warned these were not for everyone : " i suggest these non-stakeholder investments are for individuals who have investment experience and can understand the risks of investing .
" they will provide the opportunity for higher returns but there is higher risk as well to be considered . "
babies abroad although the vouchers have all been posted , it is possible that some eligible parents have not received theirs , as claire merrills from the inland revenue explained : " perhaps if people have moved and have n't let us know of their new address then we may have sent it to the wrong place , and they should contact us . "
if they move back to this country and make a claim for child benefit they will be eligible clare merrills , inland revenue she confirmed that even children born abroad would qualify for the payment if they came back to live in the uk : " they do n't qualify straightaway , but if they move back to this country and make a claim for child benefit they will be eligible for the account as soon as that claim for child benefit is accepted .
and whatever the rate is at that time they will get the voucher for that amount . "
lower income families will get an extra £ 250 .
but that will not be paid until their entitlement to child tax credit has been worked out .
the qualifying limit is a family income of £ 13,480 in 2004/05 or £ 13,910 in 2005/06 .

the plans include a 350-seat theatre , a bar for live acts , recording studio , education rooms and office space .
volunteer group menter y moelwyn , which is behind the market hall renovation , has estimated it will cost £ 3.5m.
it hopes to secure money from the national lottery , local authorities and the european union .
the designs for the future of the hall were shown to residents on saturday . "
we have come a long way but , unfortunately , we are n't at the end of the road yet " rory francis , menter y moelwyn architect mark newall , of baart harries newall , put the plans together after close consultation with the community .
the proposed 350-seater theatre would have removable chairs so it can be turned into a concert hall for a standing audience of 600 , offices and a gallery .
a modern extension would also be added to the front of the hall , which mr newall promised would be " something dramatic and contemporary " .
the market hall has been a major public venue in the town , but has not been used for more than 20 years .
in 1886 , a 23-year-old david lloyd george delivered his first public oration there and became prime minister 30 years later .
menter y moelwyn had initially estimated the renovation would cost about £ 2.5m but , once final plans had been drawn up , that rose to £ 3.5m including start up costs .
group member rory francis said constructor mcalpine had already donated £ 30,000 towards the project , with another £ 4,000 pledge by the town council .
but an application for objective one funding from the european union , which menter y moelwyn had wanted to submit in march , had had to be put on hold because of the leap in costs .
mr francis said : " we have considered scaling down the project , but we are reluctant to drop activities which local people have told us they want , or reduce office space that is likely to bring in revenue and help make the project sustainable in the long term .
" and the last thing we want to do is reduce the quality of the interior and exterior . "
" we have come a long way but , unfortunately , we are n't at the end of the road yet .
" " there 's still a major question mark over whether we will be able to realise the dream we have got but we are certainly going to be continuing . "

the firm says the price of diesel has risen from 60p to 72p a litre in the past year .
the company uses eight million litres of fuel every year and says it can no longer afford to absorb the cost of the increase without increasing fares .
the lowest single fare , currently 70p , will increase to 80p and the £ 1 and £ 1.10 fares will both go up to £ 1.20 .
the company points out however that other fares , including the all-day cityrider pass , will remain the same .

click here to send your tributes to pope john paul ii .
roman catholics around the world are waiting and praying as the life of pope john paul ii , crippled by age and illness , is slipping away .
the vatican announced on saturday morning that the condition of the pope remains " unchanged " .
the holy father 's consciousness is " compromised " and he is aware that he is dying .
on thursday the 84-year-old pontiff received the saint viaticum , the catholics ' last rites for the sick and dying .

he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children .
however i 've been disappointed by the vatican 's eurocentric theological trajectory , which has not quite been attuned with the myriad faces of suffering in the third world and the many hues of religion and culture - especially here in asia - i am sure many of us in the philippines still see him as a father figure .
we 're grateful that we 've had a personal relationship with him .
we pray that the next pope will be able to bridge the personal with the theological .
antonio d sison phd , manila , philippines i pray and hope for him to stay alive but if the almighty god has called him for eternal rest then he must be ready to answer his god 's call .
al-farouk , burkina faso you have been a true leader and we thank you for making the world a better place .
tim -lrb- 12 -rrb- , england as a catholic i pray for the pope , always and of course now when he is suffering so much and is close to death .
we say in the our father : pray for us , now and in the hour of our death .
we have a moral obligation to pray for the pope .
this pope has meant so much for humanity .
he deserves at least the nobel prize for peace .
ingeborg van der ploeg , stockholm , sweden i was once a seminarian .
i think pope john paul ii was the best we ever had .
i pray for his recovery but if it is god 's will then thy will be done .
amen .
rico samaco , leyte , philippines i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors obinna ike , lagos , nigeria may i wish the pontiff godspeed in his journey to the afterlife .
although a non-christian , i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors here .
that in itself has to be a good thing .
obinna ike , lagos , nigeria you taught us how to live and also how to end the life in dignity .
papa , we love you .
dr edwin raj , st andrews , uk i longed in vain all these years to meet pope john paul ii one day .
but now i am not sure whether that dream will ever come true .
may the lord bless this outstanding son of the world .
kurian mathew , doha , qatar i do not recognise this man who is being described in the vast majority of messages posted .
is this the same man who has set back the human rights of women , gays and lesbians with his inhuman pronouncements on abortion , contraception and homosexuality ?
even though the office of pope is irrelevant to the vast majority of planetary inhabitants and is , at best , anachronistic for those who think it means something , i sincerely hope that he is replaced by someone more connected with humanity and less obsessed by dogma .
kim grais , keighley , west yorkshire the pope was in venezuela twice .
in both of those opportunities we met a great and spiritual leader , capable of filling venezuelan people with his charisma , strength and faith .
i thank god for his work all over the world , for having him between us on earth , and i wish serenity and joy for the catholic people for his journey to the eternity .
juan pablo ii has already won heaven .
we will miss him very very much .
veronica malave , caracas , venezuela we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , uk the holy father is a special man .
he is god 's voice on earth and now he is going home to jesus .
we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon .
matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , portsmouth , uk i thank the holy father for his teachings to the world to reach out to all ; even in his passing he is doing so .
i pray that the light of heaven shine upon his face and the lord removes all his pain .
may the world take onboard his teachings that we are all brothers and sisters no mater our colour , religion or nationality .
even if we disagree on some issues we should be able to discuss them but still embrace each other as pope john paul ii has .
thank you for calling out to all in the world papa .
melissa , scotland just because the pope was give the last rites does not necessarily mean that the pope is going to die .
the last rites can be re-written and i think that as long as we all continue to pray for the pope 's recovery and never believe he will die soon , then he will recover with god 's grace .
amen .
joel collins , wolverhampton , england i love you pope , i am a shia muslim , and i want you to know that you are as loved as i love and respect ayatollah al-sistani .
adam bayzar , pleasanton , ca , usa i 've been in st peter 's square .
you have to listen to the silence to understand the message he 's leaving us ...
alex , rome , italy this man was everything to us .
pawel , poland pope 's last moments are very painful for the lovers of peace .
the world will remember this great soul as symbol of peace , integrity and brotherhood .
he was not only good to catholics and christians but equally good for the whole humankind .
may god give him eternal peace ?
dr m ashaq raza , asmara , eritrea i am a christian but by no means am i a catholic ; however there is something in the deeds of good men that transcends denomination .
i might disagree with his position doctrinally , yet he continually fought for good which is as much as anyone can do , in this i hope he may be an example to us all .
owen griffiths , bradford , uk this man truly has walked in the lord 's footsteps and has followed the apostolic succession of st peter with zeal and courage .
we admire him in his suffering as we did when he held a koala in 1986 .
god bless this most humble and holiest of men .
michael hunter , north melbourne , victoria , australia polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay mateusz olejniczak , zielona last night every single house was empty .
everyone had gone to church to pray for the pope .
we do n't want him to leave but he seems different .
remember that posted note ?
" i 'm happy .
be happy too .
i 'm leaving everything to sacred maiden maria " - so he actually wants to die and meet god in person .
polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay .
he 's getting closer to god every second .
mateusz olejniczak , zielona , poland i am a muslim and i am saddened by recent developments .
but it is allah 's will and we all pray that if he is to go , he go peacefully .
bilal patel , london , uk what do you need the comments for ?
our great pope is going through one life to another .
respect this event and do not cause a sensation , please .
zbigniew zdziennicki , lodz , poland we are three teenagers and you are our pope .
we will miss you .
even if you die , your great actions will remain forever .
high school students emanuele , monica and silvia , messina , italy i had the very great privilege of meeting the pope in the late 70s at a huge youth rally in rome .
many thousands of us gathered together , singing joyous songs .
pope john paul ii was moved to see so many young persons .
i kissed pope john paul 's hand and received his blessing .
my prayers and thoughts are with pope john paul ii at this very sad time .
carole middleton , cambridge , uk he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him patrick n chkaibam , fanar as the final hours of his wonderful life tick away and before the curtains of his life close , i ca n't but think about jean paul 's ii modesty , his wonderful and warm smile .
he was close to all different religions .
he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him .
as a lebanese christian i would never forget the joy on the day i saw him in lebanon and even muslims felt the same way .
he is a leader that would come once every thousand of years .
it would be hard to find someone who can fill his shoes .
please have mercy on his pure soul and let him be with you in your everlasting kingdom .
patrick n chkaibam , fanar , lebanon i went to vatican and it is a heart throbbing experience as the faithful join in prayer for the pope .
he left us all a wonderful personal experience which lacks words to explain .
biji , rome , italy hold on holy father , you are not alone in this state ; we are all with you in prayers .
may the almighty god who has seen you through your years of life sustain you and if the time has truly come for you to be with him in his eternal glory , may you be received peacefully .
god be with you papa .
jude lagbeneku , accra , ghana i am very sad because we are losing the pope of the young .
god bless you .
italo , ripatransone , italy i am deeply saddened to hear that pope john paul ii has received the last rites and that his health is in a critical state .
he is truly the bravest and most devoted man in history and although he will be greatly missed , i wish him peace in the arms of our father .
nicole , surrey i find it amazing , that with the terri schiavo debate raging that no one has drawn a parallel to the pope 's situation .
he has the luxury of opting not to go into hospital , where they would most probably put him on life support when necessary , and he to could live in a vegetative state indefinitely .
is n't it hypocritical of him , as leader of the catholic church , not to himself live by the by all means possible - any state of life is sacred rule ?
is n't he fortunate to have the choice that many do n't have .
sally krantz , hong kong to sally krantz , hong kong : the pope is not , like the unfortunate terri schiavo , in a permanent vegetative state .
he has been mentally alert but physically ailing for many years .
neither was the physically well but brain damaged terri schiavo on life support ; neither was she 84-years-old .
the pope is simply old , ill , and at natural end of his life .
surely choice is irrelevant in this context ?
please examine the facts more closely before drawing weak comparisons .
lucy , london i am not a roman catholic but i strongly believe that the doors of heaven have been opened for the very peaceful soul of the 84-year-old pontiff - pope john paul ii .
amudala satyanarayana , tirupati , india i say to the pope , " god be with you " .
however i am very much surprised by the reaction of many people from the west who think the pope is the only person dying today .
at 80-something more so .
please why do n't you react the same way towards the thousands dying in africa through hiv / aids ?
you really surprise me , people .
but to the pope my heart pains , for i believe you are like your god .
isheunesu abusa , harare , zimbabwe i am very touched by what is happening to the pope .
while i know that his health is in critical condition , i still wish he gets out of it .
i pray for him so that he goes in peace and with less suffering .
as a child , i was blessed by the pope when he came to my country years ago .
thank you for all what you have done in this world .
i believe that the pope is one of the greatest men of our time .
god bless you .
damien sholay , rose-hill , mauritius we watch him suffer and it is sad , such a blessed man who has the world 's integrity .
we thank god for his life .
nono , south africa , johannesburg this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii richard macdonald , usa while i wish it was n't true , i fear that the last moments of his holiness are at hand .
this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii .
as a catholic i can say we have been honoured to have him as our spiritual leader .
thank you for all that you have done your holiness .
god bless you .
richard macdonald , cherry hill , nj , usa i feel very sad that the pope is critically ill .
i can still vividly picture him celebrating the eucharist on the mount of beatitudes in israel in the jubilee year 2000 .
indeed , the pope is a great living saint , a suffering servant of god who has touched millions of lives .
god love you , john paul ii .
linus lee , singapore i am very moved by the courage and willpower of the pope and his serenity in face of suffering and death .
this is an encouragement to all of us in times of facing loss and grief .
thank you for such a positive article on bbc news .
anne marie farrell , london , uk he was elected pope months after i was born .
i saw him in poland on one of his first visits .
although i no longer practice catholicism , i am very saddened to see him go .
i have always admired his strength and uncompromising belief in the worth of every human life .
his commitment to his values , no matter how much i disagree with some of them , is admirable in this age of world leaders who change their minds with every blow of the political wind .
may he have a peaceful passing .
joanna , philadelphia , usa a sad day approaching , i 'm not a religious person but i 'm feeling sad that such a humble man who gave his love to everyone regardless of religion is soon to leave us and take his chair alongside the almighty .
god bless you john paul .
alan richardson , dudley , west midlands he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths robin , cochin , india i had the opportunity to see the pope in person when he visited india for the first time .
a person with the highest regard for human life .
he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths .
the holy father has great regard for the human life and values which was reflected in his sermons on various occasions .
some times he was criticised for being against abortion and euthanasia .
never the less he has maintained cordial relation with his detractors as well as with followers of different faiths .
the world will remember him for ever for his good deeds and clear convictions on various issues which he has held close to his chest .
may god support him in his arms till he joins the eternal father .
robin , cochin , india having read the comments sent in i find it incredible that so many people of different faiths or no faith respect and indeed love the pope .
to me it reveals how he succeeded in his mission to communicate with all people .
throughout his papacy he stressed communication and love : both seem to have won through .
i hope the suffering ends soon and he can be at peace with his maker laura the pope has indeed been a spiritual giant and a great , great leader in many areas .
the biggest blot on his record in my opinion is his stand against the use of condoms to combat aids .
he has been quite flatly wrong and there are and will be many dead as a result of his insistence on what he has seen as faithful doctrine .
may his successor be as principled and as much a force for good as this man has been , but with the ability to adapt his dogma to the realities of a suffering world .
rosemary , copenhagen , denmark he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are carmelina degiorgio , malta everyone one loves him and i bet he is in everyone 's prayers .
he did a lot of good , he was a good man and loved and forgave everyone .
he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are .
i had the occasion to see him twice when he came on a visit to malta , and i went once to rome and saw him in his balcony .
i will pray for him .
carmelina degiorgio , malta i was there on easter sunday to feel the warmth and affection of the multitude of people when the pope appeared for four minutes at the window in st peter 's square ; he was in tears , so was everyone in the crowd , looking at him .
it was a very moving experience .
his legacy would be unsurpassed for a long time to come .
zac j zacharias , new york , usa whatever your views on the catholic church , pope john paul is a rarity in our group of world leaders , in that he is totally committed to his beliefs and totally open and honest about them .
neil small , scotland a truly great person full of genuine compassion whose goodness has been the hallmark of his entire life : a serenity reflected in health and in sickness .
his impending passing away will be mourned the world over by catholics and non-catholics of every persuasion .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium holy father may god be waiting for you with open arms .
you have been a great inspiration to people all over the world and when they could n't get to you - you came to them .
i will always remember with great fondness the day you visited us in glasgow .
it is a day i will never forget - it was a glorious day in every way .
kay , haddington , east lothian as an observant jew , i would like to offer my prayers on this shabbat for the pope and for all catholics .
the current pope was not only a friend to the jewish people , whom he helped to rescue while in poland , but a friend to all humanity .
shimon cohen , new york , ny usa john paul ii continues to teach us even as he falls silent .
he is now showing how universal his message is , and how united the church stands behind him .
to him and to all his vatican colleagues , we say from the bottom of our heart , " thank you ! "
jy man , hong kong pope john paul ii is a wonderful human being ; i am very sad for him .
he will be dearly missed in this world .
i pray that he is not in any pain and that he dies in peace .
god bless you pope john paul - may god be with you .

patrick n chkaibam , fanar , lebanon i went to vatican and it is a heart throbbing experience as the faithful join in prayer for the pope .
he left us all a wonderful personal experience which lacks words to explain .
biji , rome , italy hold on holy father , you are not alone in this state ; we are all with you in prayers .
may the almighty god who has seen you through your years of life sustain you and if the time has truly come for you to be with him in his eternal glory , may you be received peacefully .
god be with you papa .
jude lagbeneku , accra , ghana i am very sad because we are losing the pope of the young .
god bless you .
italo , ripatransone , italy i am deeply saddened to hear that pope john paul ii has received the last rites and that his health is in a critical state .
he is truly the bravest and most devoted man in history and although he will be greatly missed , i wish him peace in the arms of our father .
nicole , surrey i find it amazing , that with the terri schiavo debate raging that no one has drawn a parallel to the pope 's situation .
he has the luxury of opting not to go into hospital , where they would most probably put him on life support when necessary , and he to could live in a vegetative state indefinitely .
is n't it hypocritical of him , as leader of the catholic church , not to himself live by the by all means possible - any state of life is sacred rule ?
is n't he fortunate to have the choice that many do n't have .
sally krantz , hong kong to sally krantz , hong kong : the pope is not , like the unfortunate terri schiavo , in a permanent vegetative state .
he has been mentally alert but physically ailing for many years .
neither was the physically well but brain damaged terri schiavo on life support ; neither was she 84-years-old .
the pope is simply old , ill , and at natural end of his life .
surely choice is irrelevant in this context ?
please examine the facts more closely before drawing weak comparisons .
lucy , london i am not a roman catholic but i strongly believe that the doors of heaven have been opened for the very peaceful soul of the 84-year-old pontiff - pope john paul ii .
amudala satyanarayana , tirupati , india i say to the pope , " god be with you " .
however i am very much surprised by the reaction of many people from the west who think the pope is the only person dying today .
at 80-something more so .
please why do n't you react the same way towards the thousands dying in africa through hiv / aids ?
you really surprise me , people .
but to the pope my heart pains , for i believe you are like your god .
isheunesu abusa , harare , zimbabwe i am very touched by what is happening to the pope .
while i know that his health is in critical condition , i still wish he gets out of it .
i pray for him so that he goes in peace and with less suffering .

as a catholic i can say we have been honoured to have him as our spiritual leader .
thank you for all that you have done your holiness .

richard macdonald , cherry hill , nj , usa i feel very sad that the pope is critically ill .
i can still vividly picture him celebrating the eucharist on the mount of beatitudes in israel in the jubilee year 2000 .
indeed , the pope is a great living saint , a suffering servant of god who has touched millions of lives .
god love you , john paul ii .

i saw him in poland on one of his first visits .
although i no longer practice catholicism , i am very saddened to see him go .
i have always admired his strength and uncompromising belief in the worth of every human life .
his commitment to his values , no matter how much i disagree with some of them , is admirable in this age of world leaders who change their minds with every blow of the political wind .
may he have a peaceful passing .
joanna , philadelphia , usa a sad day approaching , i 'm not a religious person but i 'm feeling sad that such a humble man who gave his love to everyone regardless of religion is soon to leave us and take his chair alongside the almighty .

alan richardson , dudley , west midlands he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths robin , cochin , india i had the opportunity to see the pope in person when he visited india for the first time .
a person with the highest regard for human life .
he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths .
the holy father has great regard for the human life and values which was reflected in his sermons on various occasions .
some times he was criticised for being against abortion and euthanasia .
never the less he has maintained cordial relation with his detractors as well as with followers of different faiths .
the world will remember him for ever for his good deeds and clear convictions on various issues which he has held close to his chest .
may god support him in his arms till he joins the eternal father .
robin , cochin , india having read the comments sent in i find it incredible that so many people of different faiths or no faith respect and indeed love the pope .
to me it reveals how he succeeded in his mission to communicate with all people .
throughout his papacy he stressed communication and love : both seem to have won through .
i hope the suffering ends soon and he can be at peace with his maker laura the pope has indeed been a spiritual giant and a great , great leader in many areas .
the biggest blot on his record in my opinion is his stand against the use of condoms to combat aids .
he has been quite flatly wrong and there are and will be many dead as a result of his insistence on what he has seen as faithful doctrine .
may his successor be as principled and as much a force for good as this man has been , but with the ability to adapt his dogma to the realities of a suffering world .
rosemary , copenhagen , denmark he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are carmelina degiorgio , malta everyone one loves him and i bet he is in everyone 's prayers .

carmelina degiorgio , malta i was there on easter sunday to feel the warmth and affection of the multitude of people when the pope appeared for four minutes at the window in st peter 's square ; he was in tears , so was everyone in the crowd , looking at him .
it was a very moving experience .
his legacy would be unsurpassed for a long time to come .
zac j zacharias , new york , usa whatever your views on the catholic church , pope john paul is a rarity in our group of world leaders , in that he is totally committed to his beliefs and totally open and honest about them .
neil small , scotland a truly great person full of genuine compassion whose goodness has been the hallmark of his entire life : a serenity reflected in health and in sickness .
his impending passing away will be mourned the world over by catholics and non-catholics of every persuasion .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium holy father may god be waiting for you with open arms .

roman catholics around the world are waiting and praying as the life of pope john paul ii , crippled by age and illness , is slipping away .
the vatican announced on saturday morning that the condition of the pope remains " unchanged " .
the holy father 's consciousness is " compromised " and he is aware that he is dying .
on thursday the 84-year-old pontiff received the saint viaticum , the catholics ' last rites for the sick and dying .

he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children .
however i 've been disappointed by the vatican 's eurocentric theological trajectory , which has not quite been attuned with the myriad faces of suffering in the third world and the many hues of religion and culture - especially here in asia - i am sure many of us in the philippines still see him as a father figure .
we 're grateful that we 've had a personal relationship with him .
we pray that the next pope will be able to bridge the personal with the theological .
antonio d sison phd , manila , philippines i pray and hope for him to stay alive but if the almighty god has called him for eternal rest then he must be ready to answer his god 's call .
al-farouk , burkina faso you have been a true leader and we thank you for making the world a better place .

we have a moral obligation to pray for the pope .
this pope has meant so much for humanity .
he deserves at least the nobel prize for peace .
ingeborg van der ploeg , stockholm , sweden i was once a seminarian .
i think pope john paul ii was the best we ever had .
i pray for his recovery but if it is god 's will then thy will be done .
amen .
rico samaco , leyte , philippines i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors obinna ike , lagos , nigeria may i wish the pontiff godspeed in his journey to the afterlife .
although a non-christian , i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors here .
that in itself has to be a good thing .
obinna ike , lagos , nigeria you taught us how to live and also how to end the life in dignity .
papa , we love you .
dr edwin raj , st andrews , uk i longed in vain all these years to meet pope john paul ii one day .
but now i am not sure whether that dream will ever come true .
may the lord bless this outstanding son of the world .
kurian mathew , doha , qatar i do not recognise this man who is being described in the vast majority of messages posted .
is this the same man who has set back the human rights of women , gays and lesbians with his inhuman pronouncements on abortion , contraception and homosexuality ?
even though the office of pope is irrelevant to the vast majority of planetary inhabitants and is , at best , anachronistic for those who think it means something , i sincerely hope that he is replaced by someone more connected with humanity and less obsessed by dogma .
kim grais , keighley , west yorkshire the pope was in venezuela twice .
in both of those opportunities we met a great and spiritual leader , capable of filling venezuelan people with his charisma , strength and faith .
i thank god for his work all over the world , for having him between us on earth , and i wish serenity and joy for the catholic people for his journey to the eternity .
juan pablo ii has already won heaven .
we will miss him very very much .
veronica malave , caracas , venezuela we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , uk the holy father is a special man .

we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon .
matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , portsmouth , uk i thank the holy father for his teachings to the world to reach out to all ; even in his passing he is doing so .
i pray that the light of heaven shine upon his face and the lord removes all his pain .
may the world take onboard his teachings that we are all brothers and sisters no mater our colour , religion or nationality .
even if we disagree on some issues we should be able to discuss them but still embrace each other as pope john paul ii has .
thank you for calling out to all in the world papa .
melissa , scotland just because the pope was give the last rites does not necessarily mean that the pope is going to die .
the last rites can be re-written and i think that as long as we all continue to pray for the pope 's recovery and never believe he will die soon , then he will recover with god 's grace .
amen .
joel collins , wolverhampton , england i love you pope , i am a shia muslim , and i want you to know that you are as loved as i love and respect ayatollah al-sistani .

pawel , poland pope 's last moments are very painful for the lovers of peace .
the world will remember this great soul as symbol of peace , integrity and brotherhood .
he was not only good to catholics and christians but equally good for the whole humankind .
may god give him eternal peace ?
dr m ashaq raza , asmara , eritrea i am a christian but by no means am i a catholic ; however there is something in the deeds of good men that transcends denomination .
i might disagree with his position doctrinally , yet he continually fought for good which is as much as anyone can do , in this i hope he may be an example to us all .
owen griffiths , bradford , uk this man truly has walked in the lord 's footsteps and has followed the apostolic succession of st peter with zeal and courage .
we admire him in his suffering as we did when he held a koala in 1986 .
god bless this most humble and holiest of men .
michael hunter , north melbourne , victoria , australia polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay mateusz olejniczak , zielona last night every single house was empty .
everyone had gone to church to pray for the pope .
we do n't want him to leave but he seems different .
remember that posted note ?
" i 'm happy .
be happy too .
i 'm leaving everything to sacred maiden maria " - so he actually wants to die and meet god in person .
polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay .
he 's getting closer to god every second .
mateusz olejniczak , zielona , poland i am a muslim and i am saddened by recent developments .
but it is allah 's will and we all pray that if he is to go , he go peacefully .

high school students emanuele , monica and silvia , messina , italy i had the very great privilege of meeting the pope in the late 70s at a huge youth rally in rome .

he was close to all different religions .
he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him .
as a lebanese christian i would never forget the joy on the day i saw him in lebanon and even muslims felt the same way .
he is a leader that would come once every thousand of years .
it would be hard to find someone who can fill his shoes .
please have mercy on his pure soul and let him be with you in your everlasting kingdom .

although a non-christian , i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors here .
that in itself has to be a good thing .
obinna ike , lagos , nigeria you taught us how to live and also how to end the life in dignity .
papa , we love you .
dr edwin raj , st andrews , uk i longed in vain all these years to meet pope john paul ii one day .
but now i am not sure whether that dream will ever come true .
may the lord bless this outstanding son of the world .
kurian mathew , doha , qatar i do not recognise this man who is being described in the vast majority of messages posted .
is this the same man who has set back the human rights of women , gays and lesbians with his inhuman pronouncements on abortion , contraception and homosexuality ?
even though the office of pope is irrelevant to the vast majority of planetary inhabitants and is , at best , anachronistic for those who think it means something , i sincerely hope that he is replaced by someone more connected with humanity and less obsessed by dogma .
kim grais , keighley , west yorkshire the pope was in venezuela twice .
in both of those opportunities we met a great and spiritual leader , capable of filling venezuelan people with his charisma , strength and faith .
i thank god for his work all over the world , for having him between us on earth , and i wish serenity and joy for the catholic people for his journey to the eternity .
juan pablo ii has already won heaven .
we will miss him very very much .
veronica malave , caracas , venezuela we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , uk the holy father is a special man .
he is god 's voice on earth and now he is going home to jesus .
we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon .
matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , portsmouth , uk i thank the holy father for his teachings to the world to reach out to all ; even in his passing he is doing so .
i pray that the light of heaven shine upon his face and the lord removes all his pain .
may the world take onboard his teachings that we are all brothers and sisters no mater our colour , religion or nationality .
even if we disagree on some issues we should be able to discuss them but still embrace each other as pope john paul ii has .
thank you for calling out to all in the world papa .
melissa , scotland just because the pope was give the last rites does not necessarily mean that the pope is going to die .
the last rites can be re-written and i think that as long as we all continue to pray for the pope 's recovery and never believe he will die soon , then he will recover with god 's grace .
amen .
joel collins , wolverhampton , england i love you pope , i am a shia muslim , and i want you to know that you are as loved as i love and respect ayatollah al-sistani .
adam bayzar , pleasanton , ca , usa i 've been in st peter 's square .
you have to listen to the silence to understand the message he 's leaving us ...
alex , rome , italy this man was everything to us .
pawel , poland pope 's last moments are very painful for the lovers of peace .
the world will remember this great soul as symbol of peace , integrity and brotherhood .
he was not only good to catholics and christians but equally good for the whole humankind .
may god give him eternal peace ?
dr m ashaq raza , asmara , eritrea i am a christian but by no means am i a catholic ; however there is something in the deeds of good men that transcends denomination .
i might disagree with his position doctrinally , yet he continually fought for good which is as much as anyone can do , in this i hope he may be an example to us all .
owen griffiths , bradford , uk this man truly has walked in the lord 's footsteps and has followed the apostolic succession of st peter with zeal and courage .
we admire him in his suffering as we did when he held a koala in 1986 .
god bless this most humble and holiest of men .
michael hunter , north melbourne , victoria , australia polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay mateusz olejniczak , zielona last night every single house was empty .
everyone had gone to church to pray for the pope .
we do n't want him to leave but he seems different .
remember that posted note ?
" i 'm happy .
be happy too .
i 'm leaving everything to sacred maiden maria " - so he actually wants to die and meet god in person .
polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay .
he 's getting closer to god every second .
mateusz olejniczak , zielona , poland i am a muslim and i am saddened by recent developments .
but it is allah 's will and we all pray that if he is to go , he go peacefully .
bilal patel , london , uk what do you need the comments for ?
our great pope is going through one life to another .
respect this event and do not cause a sensation , please .
zbigniew zdziennicki , lodz , poland we are three teenagers and you are our pope .
we will miss you .
even if you die , your great actions will remain forever .
high school students emanuele , monica and silvia , messina , italy i had the very great privilege of meeting the pope in the late 70s at a huge youth rally in rome .
many thousands of us gathered together , singing joyous songs .
pope john paul ii was moved to see so many young persons .
i kissed pope john paul 's hand and received his blessing .
my prayers and thoughts are with pope john paul ii at this very sad time .
carole middleton , cambridge , uk he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him patrick n chkaibam , fanar as the final hours of his wonderful life tick away and before the curtains of his life close , i ca n't but think about jean paul 's ii modesty , his wonderful and warm smile .
he was close to all different religions .
he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him .
as a lebanese christian i would never forget the joy on the day i saw him in lebanon and even muslims felt the same way .
he is a leader that would come once every thousand of years .
it would be hard to find someone who can fill his shoes .
please have mercy on his pure soul and let him be with you in your everlasting kingdom .
patrick n chkaibam , fanar , lebanon i went to vatican and it is a heart throbbing experience as the faithful join in prayer for the pope .
he left us all a wonderful personal experience which lacks words to explain .
biji , rome , italy hold on holy father , you are not alone in this state ; we are all with you in prayers .
may the almighty god who has seen you through your years of life sustain you and if the time has truly come for you to be with him in his eternal glory , may you be received peacefully .
god be with you papa .
jude lagbeneku , accra , ghana i am very sad because we are losing the pope of the young .
god bless you .
italo , ripatransone , italy i am deeply saddened to hear that pope john paul ii has received the last rites and that his health is in a critical state .
he is truly the bravest and most devoted man in history and although he will be greatly missed , i wish him peace in the arms of our father .
nicole , surrey i find it amazing , that with the terri schiavo debate raging that no one has drawn a parallel to the pope 's situation .
he has the luxury of opting not to go into hospital , where they would most probably put him on life support when necessary , and he to could live in a vegetative state indefinitely .
is n't it hypocritical of him , as leader of the catholic church , not to himself live by the by all means possible - any state of life is sacred rule ?
is n't he fortunate to have the choice that many do n't have .
sally krantz , hong kong to sally krantz , hong kong : the pope is not , like the unfortunate terri schiavo , in a permanent vegetative state .
he has been mentally alert but physically ailing for many years .
neither was the physically well but brain damaged terri schiavo on life support ; neither was she 84-years-old .
the pope is simply old , ill , and at natural end of his life .
surely choice is irrelevant in this context ?
please examine the facts more closely before drawing weak comparisons .
lucy , london i am not a roman catholic but i strongly believe that the doors of heaven have been opened for the very peaceful soul of the 84-year-old pontiff - pope john paul ii .
amudala satyanarayana , tirupati , india i say to the pope , " god be with you " .
however i am very much surprised by the reaction of many people from the west who think the pope is the only person dying today .
at 80-something more so .
please why do n't you react the same way towards the thousands dying in africa through hiv / aids ?
you really surprise me , people .
but to the pope my heart pains , for i believe you are like your god .
isheunesu abusa , harare , zimbabwe i am very touched by what is happening to the pope .
while i know that his health is in critical condition , i still wish he gets out of it .
i pray for him so that he goes in peace and with less suffering .
as a child , i was blessed by the pope when he came to my country years ago .
thank you for all what you have done in this world .
i believe that the pope is one of the greatest men of our time .
god bless you .

this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii .
as a catholic i can say we have been honoured to have him as our spiritual leader .
thank you for all that you have done your holiness .
god bless you .
richard macdonald , cherry hill , nj , usa i feel very sad that the pope is critically ill .
i can still vividly picture him celebrating the eucharist on the mount of beatitudes in israel in the jubilee year 2000 .
indeed , the pope is a great living saint , a suffering servant of god who has touched millions of lives .
god love you , john paul ii .
linus lee , singapore i am very moved by the courage and willpower of the pope and his serenity in face of suffering and death .
this is an encouragement to all of us in times of facing loss and grief .
thank you for such a positive article on bbc news .
anne marie farrell , london , uk he was elected pope months after i was born .
i saw him in poland on one of his first visits .
although i no longer practice catholicism , i am very saddened to see him go .
i have always admired his strength and uncompromising belief in the worth of every human life .
his commitment to his values , no matter how much i disagree with some of them , is admirable in this age of world leaders who change their minds with every blow of the political wind .
may he have a peaceful passing .
joanna , philadelphia , usa a sad day approaching , i 'm not a religious person but i 'm feeling sad that such a humble man who gave his love to everyone regardless of religion is soon to leave us and take his chair alongside the almighty .
god bless you john paul .
alan richardson , dudley , west midlands he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths robin , cochin , india i had the opportunity to see the pope in person when he visited india for the first time .
a person with the highest regard for human life .
he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths .
the holy father has great regard for the human life and values which was reflected in his sermons on various occasions .
some times he was criticised for being against abortion and euthanasia .
never the less he has maintained cordial relation with his detractors as well as with followers of different faiths .
the world will remember him for ever for his good deeds and clear convictions on various issues which he has held close to his chest .
may god support him in his arms till he joins the eternal father .
robin , cochin , india having read the comments sent in i find it incredible that so many people of different faiths or no faith respect and indeed love the pope .
to me it reveals how he succeeded in his mission to communicate with all people .
throughout his papacy he stressed communication and love : both seem to have won through .
i hope the suffering ends soon and he can be at peace with his maker laura the pope has indeed been a spiritual giant and a great , great leader in many areas .
the biggest blot on his record in my opinion is his stand against the use of condoms to combat aids .
he has been quite flatly wrong and there are and will be many dead as a result of his insistence on what he has seen as faithful doctrine .
may his successor be as principled and as much a force for good as this man has been , but with the ability to adapt his dogma to the realities of a suffering world .
rosemary , copenhagen , denmark he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are carmelina degiorgio , malta everyone one loves him and i bet he is in everyone 's prayers .
he did a lot of good , he was a good man and loved and forgave everyone .
he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are .
i had the occasion to see him twice when he came on a visit to malta , and i went once to rome and saw him in his balcony .
i will pray for him .
carmelina degiorgio , malta i was there on easter sunday to feel the warmth and affection of the multitude of people when the pope appeared for four minutes at the window in st peter 's square ; he was in tears , so was everyone in the crowd , looking at him .
it was a very moving experience .
his legacy would be unsurpassed for a long time to come .
zac j zacharias , new york , usa whatever your views on the catholic church , pope john paul is a rarity in our group of world leaders , in that he is totally committed to his beliefs and totally open and honest about them .
neil small , scotland a truly great person full of genuine compassion whose goodness has been the hallmark of his entire life : a serenity reflected in health and in sickness .
his impending passing away will be mourned the world over by catholics and non-catholics of every persuasion .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium holy father may god be waiting for you with open arms .
you have been a great inspiration to people all over the world and when they could n't get to you - you came to them .
i will always remember with great fondness the day you visited us in glasgow .
it is a day i will never forget - it was a glorious day in every way .
kay , haddington , east lothian as an observant jew , i would like to offer my prayers on this shabbat for the pope and for all catholics .
the current pope was not only a friend to the jewish people , whom he helped to rescue while in poland , but a friend to all humanity .
shimon cohen , new york , ny usa john paul ii continues to teach us even as he falls silent .
he is now showing how universal his message is , and how united the church stands behind him .
to him and to all his vatican colleagues , we say from the bottom of our heart , " thank you ! "
jy man , hong kong pope john paul ii is a wonderful human being ; i am very sad for him .
he will be dearly missed in this world .

click here to send your tributes to pope john paul ii .
roman catholics around the world are waiting and praying as the life of pope john paul ii , crippled by age and illness , is slipping away .

the holy father 's consciousness is " compromised " and he is aware that he is dying .
on thursday the 84-year-old pontiff received the saint viaticum , the catholics ' last rites for the sick and dying .
what is your reaction to the state of the pope 's health ?
have you attended a special prayer service for the pope ?
send us your comments and experiences .
you can also email your pictures and video of the pope and of special prayer services to : yourpics @ bbc.co.uk terms and conditions on sending photos and video click here to read more of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children antonio siso , manila pope john paul ii won the hearts of filipino catholics when he visited manila twice .
he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children .
however i 've been disappointed by the vatican 's eurocentric theological trajectory , which has not quite been attuned with the myriad faces of suffering in the third world and the many hues of religion and culture - especially here in asia - i am sure many of us in the philippines still see him as a father figure .
we 're grateful that we 've had a personal relationship with him .
we pray that the next pope will be able to bridge the personal with the theological .
antonio d sison phd , manila , philippines i pray and hope for him to stay alive but if the almighty god has called him for eternal rest then he must be ready to answer his god 's call .
al-farouk , burkina faso you have been a true leader and we thank you for making the world a better place .

we say in the our father : pray for us , now and in the hour of our death .
we have a moral obligation to pray for the pope .
this pope has meant so much for humanity .
he deserves at least the nobel prize for peace .
ingeborg van der ploeg , stockholm , sweden i was once a seminarian .

click here to send your tributes to pope john paul ii .
roman catholics around the world are waiting and praying as the life of pope john paul ii , crippled by age and illness , is slipping away .
the vatican announced on saturday morning that the condition of the pope remains " unchanged " .
the holy father 's consciousness is " compromised " and he is aware that he is dying .
on thursday the 84-year-old pontiff received the saint viaticum , the catholics ' last rites for the sick and dying .

he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children .
however i 've been disappointed by the vatican 's eurocentric theological trajectory , which has not quite been attuned with the myriad faces of suffering in the third world and the many hues of religion and culture - especially here in asia - i am sure many of us in the philippines still see him as a father figure .
we 're grateful that we 've had a personal relationship with him .
we pray that the next pope will be able to bridge the personal with the theological .
antonio d sison phd , manila , philippines i pray and hope for him to stay alive but if the almighty god has called him for eternal rest then he must be ready to answer his god 's call .
al-farouk , burkina faso you have been a true leader and we thank you for making the world a better place .
tim -lrb- 12 -rrb- , england as a catholic i pray for the pope , always and of course now when he is suffering so much and is close to death .
we say in the our father : pray for us , now and in the hour of our death .
we have a moral obligation to pray for the pope .
this pope has meant so much for humanity .
he deserves at least the nobel prize for peace .
ingeborg van der ploeg , stockholm , sweden i was once a seminarian .
i think pope john paul ii was the best we ever had .
i pray for his recovery but if it is god 's will then thy will be done .
amen .
rico samaco , leyte , philippines i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors obinna ike , lagos , nigeria may i wish the pontiff godspeed in his journey to the afterlife .
although a non-christian , i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors here .
that in itself has to be a good thing .
obinna ike , lagos , nigeria you taught us how to live and also how to end the life in dignity .
papa , we love you .
dr edwin raj , st andrews , uk i longed in vain all these years to meet pope john paul ii one day .
but now i am not sure whether that dream will ever come true .
may the lord bless this outstanding son of the world .
kurian mathew , doha , qatar i do not recognise this man who is being described in the vast majority of messages posted .
is this the same man who has set back the human rights of women , gays and lesbians with his inhuman pronouncements on abortion , contraception and homosexuality ?
even though the office of pope is irrelevant to the vast majority of planetary inhabitants and is , at best , anachronistic for those who think it means something , i sincerely hope that he is replaced by someone more connected with humanity and less obsessed by dogma .
kim grais , keighley , west yorkshire the pope was in venezuela twice .
in both of those opportunities we met a great and spiritual leader , capable of filling venezuelan people with his charisma , strength and faith .
i thank god for his work all over the world , for having him between us on earth , and i wish serenity and joy for the catholic people for his journey to the eternity .
juan pablo ii has already won heaven .
we will miss him very very much .
veronica malave , caracas , venezuela we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , uk the holy father is a special man .
he is god 's voice on earth and now he is going home to jesus .
we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon .
matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , portsmouth , uk i thank the holy father for his teachings to the world to reach out to all ; even in his passing he is doing so .
i pray that the light of heaven shine upon his face and the lord removes all his pain .
may the world take onboard his teachings that we are all brothers and sisters no mater our colour , religion or nationality .
even if we disagree on some issues we should be able to discuss them but still embrace each other as pope john paul ii has .
thank you for calling out to all in the world papa .
melissa , scotland just because the pope was give the last rites does not necessarily mean that the pope is going to die .
the last rites can be re-written and i think that as long as we all continue to pray for the pope 's recovery and never believe he will die soon , then he will recover with god 's grace .
amen .
joel collins , wolverhampton , england i love you pope , i am a shia muslim , and i want you to know that you are as loved as i love and respect ayatollah al-sistani .
adam bayzar , pleasanton , ca , usa i 've been in st peter 's square .
you have to listen to the silence to understand the message he 's leaving us ...
alex , rome , italy this man was everything to us .
pawel , poland pope 's last moments are very painful for the lovers of peace .
the world will remember this great soul as symbol of peace , integrity and brotherhood .
he was not only good to catholics and christians but equally good for the whole humankind .
may god give him eternal peace ?
dr m ashaq raza , asmara , eritrea i am a christian but by no means am i a catholic ; however there is something in the deeds of good men that transcends denomination .
i might disagree with his position doctrinally , yet he continually fought for good which is as much as anyone can do , in this i hope he may be an example to us all .
owen griffiths , bradford , uk this man truly has walked in the lord 's footsteps and has followed the apostolic succession of st peter with zeal and courage .
we admire him in his suffering as we did when he held a koala in 1986 .
god bless this most humble and holiest of men .
michael hunter , north melbourne , victoria , australia polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay mateusz olejniczak , zielona last night every single house was empty .
everyone had gone to church to pray for the pope .
we do n't want him to leave but he seems different .
remember that posted note ?
" i 'm happy .
be happy too .
i 'm leaving everything to sacred maiden maria " - so he actually wants to die and meet god in person .
polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay .
he 's getting closer to god every second .
mateusz olejniczak , zielona , poland i am a muslim and i am saddened by recent developments .
but it is allah 's will and we all pray that if he is to go , he go peacefully .
bilal patel , london , uk what do you need the comments for ?
our great pope is going through one life to another .
respect this event and do not cause a sensation , please .
zbigniew zdziennicki , lodz , poland we are three teenagers and you are our pope .
we will miss you .
even if you die , your great actions will remain forever .
high school students emanuele , monica and silvia , messina , italy i had the very great privilege of meeting the pope in the late 70s at a huge youth rally in rome .
many thousands of us gathered together , singing joyous songs .
pope john paul ii was moved to see so many young persons .
i kissed pope john paul 's hand and received his blessing .
my prayers and thoughts are with pope john paul ii at this very sad time .
carole middleton , cambridge , uk he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him patrick n chkaibam , fanar as the final hours of his wonderful life tick away and before the curtains of his life close , i ca n't but think about jean paul 's ii modesty , his wonderful and warm smile .
he was close to all different religions .
he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him .
as a lebanese christian i would never forget the joy on the day i saw him in lebanon and even muslims felt the same way .
he is a leader that would come once every thousand of years .
it would be hard to find someone who can fill his shoes .
please have mercy on his pure soul and let him be with you in your everlasting kingdom .
patrick n chkaibam , fanar , lebanon i went to vatican and it is a heart throbbing experience as the faithful join in prayer for the pope .
he left us all a wonderful personal experience which lacks words to explain .
biji , rome , italy hold on holy father , you are not alone in this state ; we are all with you in prayers .
may the almighty god who has seen you through your years of life sustain you and if the time has truly come for you to be with him in his eternal glory , may you be received peacefully .
god be with you papa .
jude lagbeneku , accra , ghana i am very sad because we are losing the pope of the young .
god bless you .
italo , ripatransone , italy i am deeply saddened to hear that pope john paul ii has received the last rites and that his health is in a critical state .
he is truly the bravest and most devoted man in history and although he will be greatly missed , i wish him peace in the arms of our father .
nicole , surrey i find it amazing , that with the terri schiavo debate raging that no one has drawn a parallel to the pope 's situation .
he has the luxury of opting not to go into hospital , where they would most probably put him on life support when necessary , and he to could live in a vegetative state indefinitely .
is n't it hypocritical of him , as leader of the catholic church , not to himself live by the by all means possible - any state of life is sacred rule ?
is n't he fortunate to have the choice that many do n't have .
sally krantz , hong kong to sally krantz , hong kong : the pope is not , like the unfortunate terri schiavo , in a permanent vegetative state .
he has been mentally alert but physically ailing for many years .
neither was the physically well but brain damaged terri schiavo on life support ; neither was she 84-years-old .
the pope is simply old , ill , and at natural end of his life .
surely choice is irrelevant in this context ?
please examine the facts more closely before drawing weak comparisons .
lucy , london i am not a roman catholic but i strongly believe that the doors of heaven have been opened for the very peaceful soul of the 84-year-old pontiff - pope john paul ii .
amudala satyanarayana , tirupati , india i say to the pope , " god be with you " .
however i am very much surprised by the reaction of many people from the west who think the pope is the only person dying today .
at 80-something more so .
please why do n't you react the same way towards the thousands dying in africa through hiv / aids ?
you really surprise me , people .
but to the pope my heart pains , for i believe you are like your god .
isheunesu abusa , harare , zimbabwe i am very touched by what is happening to the pope .
while i know that his health is in critical condition , i still wish he gets out of it .
i pray for him so that he goes in peace and with less suffering .
as a child , i was blessed by the pope when he came to my country years ago .
thank you for all what you have done in this world .
i believe that the pope is one of the greatest men of our time .
god bless you .
damien sholay , rose-hill , mauritius we watch him suffer and it is sad , such a blessed man who has the world 's integrity .
we thank god for his life .
nono , south africa , johannesburg this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii richard macdonald , usa while i wish it was n't true , i fear that the last moments of his holiness are at hand .
this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii .
as a catholic i can say we have been honoured to have him as our spiritual leader .
thank you for all that you have done your holiness .
god bless you .
richard macdonald , cherry hill , nj , usa i feel very sad that the pope is critically ill .
i can still vividly picture him celebrating the eucharist on the mount of beatitudes in israel in the jubilee year 2000 .
indeed , the pope is a great living saint , a suffering servant of god who has touched millions of lives .
god love you , john paul ii .
linus lee , singapore i am very moved by the courage and willpower of the pope and his serenity in face of suffering and death .
this is an encouragement to all of us in times of facing loss and grief .
thank you for such a positive article on bbc news .
anne marie farrell , london , uk he was elected pope months after i was born .
i saw him in poland on one of his first visits .
although i no longer practice catholicism , i am very saddened to see him go .
i have always admired his strength and uncompromising belief in the worth of every human life .
his commitment to his values , no matter how much i disagree with some of them , is admirable in this age of world leaders who change their minds with every blow of the political wind .
may he have a peaceful passing .
joanna , philadelphia , usa a sad day approaching , i 'm not a religious person but i 'm feeling sad that such a humble man who gave his love to everyone regardless of religion is soon to leave us and take his chair alongside the almighty .
god bless you john paul .
alan richardson , dudley , west midlands he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths robin , cochin , india i had the opportunity to see the pope in person when he visited india for the first time .
a person with the highest regard for human life .
he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths .
the holy father has great regard for the human life and values which was reflected in his sermons on various occasions .
some times he was criticised for being against abortion and euthanasia .
never the less he has maintained cordial relation with his detractors as well as with followers of different faiths .
the world will remember him for ever for his good deeds and clear convictions on various issues which he has held close to his chest .
may god support him in his arms till he joins the eternal father .
robin , cochin , india having read the comments sent in i find it incredible that so many people of different faiths or no faith respect and indeed love the pope .
to me it reveals how he succeeded in his mission to communicate with all people .
throughout his papacy he stressed communication and love : both seem to have won through .
i hope the suffering ends soon and he can be at peace with his maker laura the pope has indeed been a spiritual giant and a great , great leader in many areas .
the biggest blot on his record in my opinion is his stand against the use of condoms to combat aids .
he has been quite flatly wrong and there are and will be many dead as a result of his insistence on what he has seen as faithful doctrine .
may his successor be as principled and as much a force for good as this man has been , but with the ability to adapt his dogma to the realities of a suffering world .
rosemary , copenhagen , denmark he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are carmelina degiorgio , malta everyone one loves him and i bet he is in everyone 's prayers .
he did a lot of good , he was a good man and loved and forgave everyone .

god bless you .
italo , ripatransone , italy i am deeply saddened to hear that pope john paul ii has received the last rites and that his health is in a critical state .
he is truly the bravest and most devoted man in history and although he will be greatly missed , i wish him peace in the arms of our father .
nicole , surrey i find it amazing , that with the terri schiavo debate raging that no one has drawn a parallel to the pope 's situation .
he has the luxury of opting not to go into hospital , where they would most probably put him on life support when necessary , and he to could live in a vegetative state indefinitely .
is n't it hypocritical of him , as leader of the catholic church , not to himself live by the by all means possible - any state of life is sacred rule ?
is n't he fortunate to have the choice that many do n't have .
sally krantz , hong kong to sally krantz , hong kong : the pope is not , like the unfortunate terri schiavo , in a permanent vegetative state .
he has been mentally alert but physically ailing for many years .
neither was the physically well but brain damaged terri schiavo on life support ; neither was she 84-years-old .
the pope is simply old , ill , and at natural end of his life .
surely choice is irrelevant in this context ?
please examine the facts more closely before drawing weak comparisons .
lucy , london i am not a roman catholic but i strongly believe that the doors of heaven have been opened for the very peaceful soul of the 84-year-old pontiff - pope john paul ii .
amudala satyanarayana , tirupati , india i say to the pope , " god be with you " .
however i am very much surprised by the reaction of many people from the west who think the pope is the only person dying today .
at 80-something more so .
please why do n't you react the same way towards the thousands dying in africa through hiv / aids ?
you really surprise me , people .
but to the pope my heart pains , for i believe you are like your god .
isheunesu abusa , harare , zimbabwe i am very touched by what is happening to the pope .
while i know that his health is in critical condition , i still wish he gets out of it .
i pray for him so that he goes in peace and with less suffering .
as a child , i was blessed by the pope when he came to my country years ago .
thank you for all what you have done in this world .
i believe that the pope is one of the greatest men of our time .
god bless you .
damien sholay , rose-hill , mauritius we watch him suffer and it is sad , such a blessed man who has the world 's integrity .

this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii .
as a catholic i can say we have been honoured to have him as our spiritual leader .
thank you for all that you have done your holiness .
god bless you .
richard macdonald , cherry hill , nj , usa i feel very sad that the pope is critically ill .
i can still vividly picture him celebrating the eucharist on the mount of beatitudes in israel in the jubilee year 2000 .
indeed , the pope is a great living saint , a suffering servant of god who has touched millions of lives .
god love you , john paul ii .
linus lee , singapore i am very moved by the courage and willpower of the pope and his serenity in face of suffering and death .
this is an encouragement to all of us in times of facing loss and grief .
thank you for such a positive article on bbc news .
anne marie farrell , london , uk he was elected pope months after i was born .
i saw him in poland on one of his first visits .
although i no longer practice catholicism , i am very saddened to see him go .
i have always admired his strength and uncompromising belief in the worth of every human life .
his commitment to his values , no matter how much i disagree with some of them , is admirable in this age of world leaders who change their minds with every blow of the political wind .
may he have a peaceful passing .
joanna , philadelphia , usa a sad day approaching , i 'm not a religious person but i 'm feeling sad that such a humble man who gave his love to everyone regardless of religion is soon to leave us and take his chair alongside the almighty .
god bless you john paul .
alan richardson , dudley , west midlands he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths robin , cochin , india i had the opportunity to see the pope in person when he visited india for the first time .
a person with the highest regard for human life .
he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths .
the holy father has great regard for the human life and values which was reflected in his sermons on various occasions .
some times he was criticised for being against abortion and euthanasia .
never the less he has maintained cordial relation with his detractors as well as with followers of different faiths .
the world will remember him for ever for his good deeds and clear convictions on various issues which he has held close to his chest .
may god support him in his arms till he joins the eternal father .
robin , cochin , india having read the comments sent in i find it incredible that so many people of different faiths or no faith respect and indeed love the pope .
to me it reveals how he succeeded in his mission to communicate with all people .
throughout his papacy he stressed communication and love : both seem to have won through .
i hope the suffering ends soon and he can be at peace with his maker laura the pope has indeed been a spiritual giant and a great , great leader in many areas .
the biggest blot on his record in my opinion is his stand against the use of condoms to combat aids .
he has been quite flatly wrong and there are and will be many dead as a result of his insistence on what he has seen as faithful doctrine .
may his successor be as principled and as much a force for good as this man has been , but with the ability to adapt his dogma to the realities of a suffering world .
rosemary , copenhagen , denmark he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are carmelina degiorgio , malta everyone one loves him and i bet he is in everyone 's prayers .
he did a lot of good , he was a good man and loved and forgave everyone .
he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are .
i had the occasion to see him twice when he came on a visit to malta , and i went once to rome and saw him in his balcony .
i will pray for him .
carmelina degiorgio , malta i was there on easter sunday to feel the warmth and affection of the multitude of people when the pope appeared for four minutes at the window in st peter 's square ; he was in tears , so was everyone in the crowd , looking at him .
it was a very moving experience .
his legacy would be unsurpassed for a long time to come .
zac j zacharias , new york , usa whatever your views on the catholic church , pope john paul is a rarity in our group of world leaders , in that he is totally committed to his beliefs and totally open and honest about them .
neil small , scotland a truly great person full of genuine compassion whose goodness has been the hallmark of his entire life : a serenity reflected in health and in sickness .
his impending passing away will be mourned the world over by catholics and non-catholics of every persuasion .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium holy father may god be waiting for you with open arms .
you have been a great inspiration to people all over the world and when they could n't get to you - you came to them .
i will always remember with great fondness the day you visited us in glasgow .
it is a day i will never forget - it was a glorious day in every way .
kay , haddington , east lothian as an observant jew , i would like to offer my prayers on this shabbat for the pope and for all catholics .
the current pope was not only a friend to the jewish people , whom he helped to rescue while in poland , but a friend to all humanity .
shimon cohen , new york , ny usa john paul ii continues to teach us even as he falls silent .
he is now showing how universal his message is , and how united the church stands behind him .
to him and to all his vatican colleagues , we say from the bottom of our heart , " thank you ! "
jy man , hong kong pope john paul ii is a wonderful human being ; i am very sad for him .
he will be dearly missed in this world .
i pray that he is not in any pain and that he dies in peace .

the vatican announced on saturday morning that the condition of the pope remains " unchanged " .
the holy father 's consciousness is " compromised " and he is aware that he is dying .

he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children .
however i 've been disappointed by the vatican 's eurocentric theological trajectory , which has not quite been attuned with the myriad faces of suffering in the third world and the many hues of religion and culture - especially here in asia - i am sure many of us in the philippines still see him as a father figure .
we 're grateful that we 've had a personal relationship with him .
we pray that the next pope will be able to bridge the personal with the theological .
antonio d sison phd , manila , philippines i pray and hope for him to stay alive but if the almighty god has called him for eternal rest then he must be ready to answer his god 's call .
al-farouk , burkina faso you have been a true leader and we thank you for making the world a better place .
tim -lrb- 12 -rrb- , england as a catholic i pray for the pope , always and of course now when he is suffering so much and is close to death .
we say in the our father : pray for us , now and in the hour of our death .
we have a moral obligation to pray for the pope .
this pope has meant so much for humanity .
he deserves at least the nobel prize for peace .
ingeborg van der ploeg , stockholm , sweden i was once a seminarian .
i think pope john paul ii was the best we ever had .
i pray for his recovery but if it is god 's will then thy will be done .
amen .
rico samaco , leyte , philippines i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors obinna ike , lagos , nigeria may i wish the pontiff godspeed in his journey to the afterlife .
although a non-christian , i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors here .
that in itself has to be a good thing .
obinna ike , lagos , nigeria you taught us how to live and also how to end the life in dignity .
papa , we love you .
dr edwin raj , st andrews , uk i longed in vain all these years to meet pope john paul ii one day .
but now i am not sure whether that dream will ever come true .
may the lord bless this outstanding son of the world .
kurian mathew , doha , qatar i do not recognise this man who is being described in the vast majority of messages posted .
is this the same man who has set back the human rights of women , gays and lesbians with his inhuman pronouncements on abortion , contraception and homosexuality ?
even though the office of pope is irrelevant to the vast majority of planetary inhabitants and is , at best , anachronistic for those who think it means something , i sincerely hope that he is replaced by someone more connected with humanity and less obsessed by dogma .
kim grais , keighley , west yorkshire the pope was in venezuela twice .
in both of those opportunities we met a great and spiritual leader , capable of filling venezuelan people with his charisma , strength and faith .
i thank god for his work all over the world , for having him between us on earth , and i wish serenity and joy for the catholic people for his journey to the eternity .
juan pablo ii has already won heaven .
we will miss him very very much .
veronica malave , caracas , venezuela we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , uk the holy father is a special man .
he is god 's voice on earth and now he is going home to jesus .
we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon .
matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , portsmouth , uk i thank the holy father for his teachings to the world to reach out to all ; even in his passing he is doing so .
i pray that the light of heaven shine upon his face and the lord removes all his pain .
may the world take onboard his teachings that we are all brothers and sisters no mater our colour , religion or nationality .
even if we disagree on some issues we should be able to discuss them but still embrace each other as pope john paul ii has .
thank you for calling out to all in the world papa .
melissa , scotland just because the pope was give the last rites does not necessarily mean that the pope is going to die .
the last rites can be re-written and i think that as long as we all continue to pray for the pope 's recovery and never believe he will die soon , then he will recover with god 's grace .
amen .
joel collins , wolverhampton , england i love you pope , i am a shia muslim , and i want you to know that you are as loved as i love and respect ayatollah al-sistani .
adam bayzar , pleasanton , ca , usa i 've been in st peter 's square .
you have to listen to the silence to understand the message he 's leaving us ...
alex , rome , italy this man was everything to us .
pawel , poland pope 's last moments are very painful for the lovers of peace .
the world will remember this great soul as symbol of peace , integrity and brotherhood .
he was not only good to catholics and christians but equally good for the whole humankind .
may god give him eternal peace ?
dr m ashaq raza , asmara , eritrea i am a christian but by no means am i a catholic ; however there is something in the deeds of good men that transcends denomination .
i might disagree with his position doctrinally , yet he continually fought for good which is as much as anyone can do , in this i hope he may be an example to us all .
owen griffiths , bradford , uk this man truly has walked in the lord 's footsteps and has followed the apostolic succession of st peter with zeal and courage .
we admire him in his suffering as we did when he held a koala in 1986 .
god bless this most humble and holiest of men .
michael hunter , north melbourne , victoria , australia polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay mateusz olejniczak , zielona last night every single house was empty .
everyone had gone to church to pray for the pope .
we do n't want him to leave but he seems different .
remember that posted note ?
" i 'm happy .
be happy too .
i 'm leaving everything to sacred maiden maria " - so he actually wants to die and meet god in person .
polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay .
he 's getting closer to god every second .
mateusz olejniczak , zielona , poland i am a muslim and i am saddened by recent developments .
but it is allah 's will and we all pray that if he is to go , he go peacefully .
bilal patel , london , uk what do you need the comments for ?
our great pope is going through one life to another .
respect this event and do not cause a sensation , please .
zbigniew zdziennicki , lodz , poland we are three teenagers and you are our pope .
we will miss you .
even if you die , your great actions will remain forever .
high school students emanuele , monica and silvia , messina , italy i had the very great privilege of meeting the pope in the late 70s at a huge youth rally in rome .
many thousands of us gathered together , singing joyous songs .
pope john paul ii was moved to see so many young persons .
i kissed pope john paul 's hand and received his blessing .
my prayers and thoughts are with pope john paul ii at this very sad time .
carole middleton , cambridge , uk he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him patrick n chkaibam , fanar as the final hours of his wonderful life tick away and before the curtains of his life close , i ca n't but think about jean paul 's ii modesty , his wonderful and warm smile .
he was close to all different religions .
he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him .
as a lebanese christian i would never forget the joy on the day i saw him in lebanon and even muslims felt the same way .
he is a leader that would come once every thousand of years .
it would be hard to find someone who can fill his shoes .
please have mercy on his pure soul and let him be with you in your everlasting kingdom .
patrick n chkaibam , fanar , lebanon i went to vatican and it is a heart throbbing experience as the faithful join in prayer for the pope .
he left us all a wonderful personal experience which lacks words to explain .
biji , rome , italy hold on holy father , you are not alone in this state ; we are all with you in prayers .
may the almighty god who has seen you through your years of life sustain you and if the time has truly come for you to be with him in his eternal glory , may you be received peacefully .

is this the same man who has set back the human rights of women , gays and lesbians with his inhuman pronouncements on abortion , contraception and homosexuality ?
even though the office of pope is irrelevant to the vast majority of planetary inhabitants and is , at best , anachronistic for those who think it means something , i sincerely hope that he is replaced by someone more connected with humanity and less obsessed by dogma .
kim grais , keighley , west yorkshire the pope was in venezuela twice .
in both of those opportunities we met a great and spiritual leader , capable of filling venezuelan people with his charisma , strength and faith .
i thank god for his work all over the world , for having him between us on earth , and i wish serenity and joy for the catholic people for his journey to the eternity .
juan pablo ii has already won heaven .
we will miss him very very much .
veronica malave , caracas , venezuela we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , uk the holy father is a special man .
he is god 's voice on earth and now he is going home to jesus .
we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon .
matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , portsmouth , uk i thank the holy father for his teachings to the world to reach out to all ; even in his passing he is doing so .
i pray that the light of heaven shine upon his face and the lord removes all his pain .
may the world take onboard his teachings that we are all brothers and sisters no mater our colour , religion or nationality .
even if we disagree on some issues we should be able to discuss them but still embrace each other as pope john paul ii has .
thank you for calling out to all in the world papa .
melissa , scotland just because the pope was give the last rites does not necessarily mean that the pope is going to die .
the last rites can be re-written and i think that as long as we all continue to pray for the pope 's recovery and never believe he will die soon , then he will recover with god 's grace .
amen .
joel collins , wolverhampton , england i love you pope , i am a shia muslim , and i want you to know that you are as loved as i love and respect ayatollah al-sistani .
adam bayzar , pleasanton , ca , usa i 've been in st peter 's square .
you have to listen to the silence to understand the message he 's leaving us ...
alex , rome , italy this man was everything to us .
pawel , poland pope 's last moments are very painful for the lovers of peace .
the world will remember this great soul as symbol of peace , integrity and brotherhood .
he was not only good to catholics and christians but equally good for the whole humankind .
may god give him eternal peace ?
dr m ashaq raza , asmara , eritrea i am a christian but by no means am i a catholic ; however there is something in the deeds of good men that transcends denomination .
i might disagree with his position doctrinally , yet he continually fought for good which is as much as anyone can do , in this i hope he may be an example to us all .
owen griffiths , bradford , uk this man truly has walked in the lord 's footsteps and has followed the apostolic succession of st peter with zeal and courage .
we admire him in his suffering as we did when he held a koala in 1986 .
god bless this most humble and holiest of men .
michael hunter , north melbourne , victoria , australia polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay mateusz olejniczak , zielona last night every single house was empty .
everyone had gone to church to pray for the pope .
we do n't want him to leave but he seems different .
remember that posted note ?
" i 'm happy .
be happy too .
i 'm leaving everything to sacred maiden maria " - so he actually wants to die and meet god in person .
polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay .
he 's getting closer to god every second .
mateusz olejniczak , zielona , poland i am a muslim and i am saddened by recent developments .
but it is allah 's will and we all pray that if he is to go , he go peacefully .
bilal patel , london , uk what do you need the comments for ?
our great pope is going through one life to another .
respect this event and do not cause a sensation , please .
zbigniew zdziennicki , lodz , poland we are three teenagers and you are our pope .
we will miss you .
even if you die , your great actions will remain forever .
high school students emanuele , monica and silvia , messina , italy i had the very great privilege of meeting the pope in the late 70s at a huge youth rally in rome .
many thousands of us gathered together , singing joyous songs .
pope john paul ii was moved to see so many young persons .
i kissed pope john paul 's hand and received his blessing .
my prayers and thoughts are with pope john paul ii at this very sad time .
carole middleton , cambridge , uk he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him patrick n chkaibam , fanar as the final hours of his wonderful life tick away and before the curtains of his life close , i ca n't but think about jean paul 's ii modesty , his wonderful and warm smile .
he was close to all different religions .
he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him .
as a lebanese christian i would never forget the joy on the day i saw him in lebanon and even muslims felt the same way .
he is a leader that would come once every thousand of years .
it would be hard to find someone who can fill his shoes .
please have mercy on his pure soul and let him be with you in your everlasting kingdom .
patrick n chkaibam , fanar , lebanon i went to vatican and it is a heart throbbing experience as the faithful join in prayer for the pope .
he left us all a wonderful personal experience which lacks words to explain .
biji , rome , italy hold on holy father , you are not alone in this state ; we are all with you in prayers .
may the almighty god who has seen you through your years of life sustain you and if the time has truly come for you to be with him in his eternal glory , may you be received peacefully .
god be with you papa .
jude lagbeneku , accra , ghana i am very sad because we are losing the pope of the young .
god bless you .
italo , ripatransone , italy i am deeply saddened to hear that pope john paul ii has received the last rites and that his health is in a critical state .
he is truly the bravest and most devoted man in history and although he will be greatly missed , i wish him peace in the arms of our father .
nicole , surrey i find it amazing , that with the terri schiavo debate raging that no one has drawn a parallel to the pope 's situation .
he has the luxury of opting not to go into hospital , where they would most probably put him on life support when necessary , and he to could live in a vegetative state indefinitely .
is n't it hypocritical of him , as leader of the catholic church , not to himself live by the by all means possible - any state of life is sacred rule ?
is n't he fortunate to have the choice that many do n't have .
sally krantz , hong kong to sally krantz , hong kong : the pope is not , like the unfortunate terri schiavo , in a permanent vegetative state .
he has been mentally alert but physically ailing for many years .
neither was the physically well but brain damaged terri schiavo on life support ; neither was she 84-years-old .
the pope is simply old , ill , and at natural end of his life .
surely choice is irrelevant in this context ?
please examine the facts more closely before drawing weak comparisons .
lucy , london i am not a roman catholic but i strongly believe that the doors of heaven have been opened for the very peaceful soul of the 84-year-old pontiff - pope john paul ii .
amudala satyanarayana , tirupati , india i say to the pope , " god be with you " .
however i am very much surprised by the reaction of many people from the west who think the pope is the only person dying today .
at 80-something more so .
please why do n't you react the same way towards the thousands dying in africa through hiv / aids ?
you really surprise me , people .
but to the pope my heart pains , for i believe you are like your god .
isheunesu abusa , harare , zimbabwe i am very touched by what is happening to the pope .
while i know that his health is in critical condition , i still wish he gets out of it .
i pray for him so that he goes in peace and with less suffering .
as a child , i was blessed by the pope when he came to my country years ago .
thank you for all what you have done in this world .
i believe that the pope is one of the greatest men of our time .
god bless you .
damien sholay , rose-hill , mauritius we watch him suffer and it is sad , such a blessed man who has the world 's integrity .
we thank god for his life .
nono , south africa , johannesburg this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii richard macdonald , usa while i wish it was n't true , i fear that the last moments of his holiness are at hand .
this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii .
as a catholic i can say we have been honoured to have him as our spiritual leader .
thank you for all that you have done your holiness .
god bless you .
richard macdonald , cherry hill , nj , usa i feel very sad that the pope is critically ill .
i can still vividly picture him celebrating the eucharist on the mount of beatitudes in israel in the jubilee year 2000 .
indeed , the pope is a great living saint , a suffering servant of god who has touched millions of lives .
god love you , john paul ii .
linus lee , singapore i am very moved by the courage and willpower of the pope and his serenity in face of suffering and death .
this is an encouragement to all of us in times of facing loss and grief .
thank you for such a positive article on bbc news .
anne marie farrell , london , uk he was elected pope months after i was born .
i saw him in poland on one of his first visits .
although i no longer practice catholicism , i am very saddened to see him go .
i have always admired his strength and uncompromising belief in the worth of every human life .
his commitment to his values , no matter how much i disagree with some of them , is admirable in this age of world leaders who change their minds with every blow of the political wind .
may he have a peaceful passing .
joanna , philadelphia , usa a sad day approaching , i 'm not a religious person but i 'm feeling sad that such a humble man who gave his love to everyone regardless of religion is soon to leave us and take his chair alongside the almighty .
god bless you john paul .
alan richardson , dudley , west midlands he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths robin , cochin , india i had the opportunity to see the pope in person when he visited india for the first time .
a person with the highest regard for human life .
he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths .
the holy father has great regard for the human life and values which was reflected in his sermons on various occasions .
some times he was criticised for being against abortion and euthanasia .
never the less he has maintained cordial relation with his detractors as well as with followers of different faiths .
the world will remember him for ever for his good deeds and clear convictions on various issues which he has held close to his chest .
may god support him in his arms till he joins the eternal father .
robin , cochin , india having read the comments sent in i find it incredible that so many people of different faiths or no faith respect and indeed love the pope .
to me it reveals how he succeeded in his mission to communicate with all people .
throughout his papacy he stressed communication and love : both seem to have won through .
i hope the suffering ends soon and he can be at peace with his maker laura the pope has indeed been a spiritual giant and a great , great leader in many areas .
the biggest blot on his record in my opinion is his stand against the use of condoms to combat aids .
he has been quite flatly wrong and there are and will be many dead as a result of his insistence on what he has seen as faithful doctrine .
may his successor be as principled and as much a force for good as this man has been , but with the ability to adapt his dogma to the realities of a suffering world .
rosemary , copenhagen , denmark he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are carmelina degiorgio , malta everyone one loves him and i bet he is in everyone 's prayers .
he did a lot of good , he was a good man and loved and forgave everyone .
he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are .
i had the occasion to see him twice when he came on a visit to malta , and i went once to rome and saw him in his balcony .
i will pray for him .
carmelina degiorgio , malta i was there on easter sunday to feel the warmth and affection of the multitude of people when the pope appeared for four minutes at the window in st peter 's square ; he was in tears , so was everyone in the crowd , looking at him .
it was a very moving experience .
his legacy would be unsurpassed for a long time to come .
zac j zacharias , new york , usa whatever your views on the catholic church , pope john paul is a rarity in our group of world leaders , in that he is totally committed to his beliefs and totally open and honest about them .
neil small , scotland a truly great person full of genuine compassion whose goodness has been the hallmark of his entire life : a serenity reflected in health and in sickness .
his impending passing away will be mourned the world over by catholics and non-catholics of every persuasion .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium holy father may god be waiting for you with open arms .
you have been a great inspiration to people all over the world and when they could n't get to you - you came to them .
i will always remember with great fondness the day you visited us in glasgow .
it is a day i will never forget - it was a glorious day in every way .
kay , haddington , east lothian as an observant jew , i would like to offer my prayers on this shabbat for the pope and for all catholics .
the current pope was not only a friend to the jewish people , whom he helped to rescue while in poland , but a friend to all humanity .
shimon cohen , new york , ny usa john paul ii continues to teach us even as he falls silent .
he is now showing how universal his message is , and how united the church stands behind him .
to him and to all his vatican colleagues , we say from the bottom of our heart , " thank you ! "
jy man , hong kong pope john paul ii is a wonderful human being ; i am very sad for him .
he will be dearly missed in this world .
i pray that he is not in any pain and that he dies in peace .

click here to send your tributes to pope john paul ii .
roman catholics around the world are waiting and praying as the life of pope john paul ii , crippled by age and illness , is slipping away .
the vatican announced on saturday morning that the condition of the pope remains " unchanged " .
the holy father 's consciousness is " compromised " and he is aware that he is dying .
on thursday the 84-year-old pontiff received the saint viaticum , the catholics ' last rites for the sick and dying .
what is your reaction to the state of the pope 's health ?
have you attended a special prayer service for the pope ?
send us your comments and experiences .
you can also email your pictures and video of the pope and of special prayer services to : yourpics @ bbc.co.uk terms and conditions on sending photos and video click here to read more of your comments the following comments reflect the balance of opinion we have received so far : he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children antonio siso , manila pope john paul ii won the hearts of filipino catholics when he visited manila twice .
he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children .
however i 've been disappointed by the vatican 's eurocentric theological trajectory , which has not quite been attuned with the myriad faces of suffering in the third world and the many hues of religion and culture - especially here in asia - i am sure many of us in the philippines still see him as a father figure .
we 're grateful that we 've had a personal relationship with him .
we pray that the next pope will be able to bridge the personal with the theological .
antonio d sison phd , manila , philippines i pray and hope for him to stay alive but if the almighty god has called him for eternal rest then he must be ready to answer his god 's call .
al-farouk , burkina faso you have been a true leader and we thank you for making the world a better place .
tim -lrb- 12 -rrb- , england as a catholic i pray for the pope , always and of course now when he is suffering so much and is close to death .
we say in the our father : pray for us , now and in the hour of our death .
we have a moral obligation to pray for the pope .
this pope has meant so much for humanity .
he deserves at least the nobel prize for peace .
ingeborg van der ploeg , stockholm , sweden i was once a seminarian .
i think pope john paul ii was the best we ever had .
i pray for his recovery but if it is god 's will then thy will be done .

although a non-christian , i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors here .
that in itself has to be a good thing .
obinna ike , lagos , nigeria you taught us how to live and also how to end the life in dignity .
papa , we love you .

roman catholics around the world are waiting and praying as the life of pope john paul ii , crippled by age and illness , is slipping away .
the vatican announced on saturday morning that the condition of the pope remains " unchanged " .
the holy father 's consciousness is " compromised " and he is aware that he is dying .
on thursday the 84-year-old pontiff received the saint viaticum , the catholics ' last rites for the sick and dying .

he came as a father figure personally concerned for his struggling children .
however i 've been disappointed by the vatican 's eurocentric theological trajectory , which has not quite been attuned with the myriad faces of suffering in the third world and the many hues of religion and culture - especially here in asia - i am sure many of us in the philippines still see him as a father figure .
we 're grateful that we 've had a personal relationship with him .
we pray that the next pope will be able to bridge the personal with the theological .
antonio d sison phd , manila , philippines i pray and hope for him to stay alive but if the almighty god has called him for eternal rest then he must be ready to answer his god 's call .
al-farouk , burkina faso you have been a true leader and we thank you for making the world a better place .
tim -lrb- 12 -rrb- , england as a catholic i pray for the pope , always and of course now when he is suffering so much and is close to death .
we say in the our father : pray for us , now and in the hour of our death .
we have a moral obligation to pray for the pope .
this pope has meant so much for humanity .
he deserves at least the nobel prize for peace .
ingeborg van der ploeg , stockholm , sweden i was once a seminarian .
i think pope john paul ii was the best we ever had .
i pray for his recovery but if it is god 's will then thy will be done .
amen .
rico samaco , leyte , philippines i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors obinna ike , lagos , nigeria may i wish the pontiff godspeed in his journey to the afterlife .
although a non-christian , i 'm touched by the inter-religious solidarity shown by contributors here .
that in itself has to be a good thing .
obinna ike , lagos , nigeria you taught us how to live and also how to end the life in dignity .
papa , we love you .
dr edwin raj , st andrews , uk i longed in vain all these years to meet pope john paul ii one day .
but now i am not sure whether that dream will ever come true .
may the lord bless this outstanding son of the world .
kurian mathew , doha , qatar i do not recognise this man who is being described in the vast majority of messages posted .
is this the same man who has set back the human rights of women , gays and lesbians with his inhuman pronouncements on abortion , contraception and homosexuality ?
even though the office of pope is irrelevant to the vast majority of planetary inhabitants and is , at best , anachronistic for those who think it means something , i sincerely hope that he is replaced by someone more connected with humanity and less obsessed by dogma .
kim grais , keighley , west yorkshire the pope was in venezuela twice .
in both of those opportunities we met a great and spiritual leader , capable of filling venezuelan people with his charisma , strength and faith .
i thank god for his work all over the world , for having him between us on earth , and i wish serenity and joy for the catholic people for his journey to the eternity .
juan pablo ii has already won heaven .
we will miss him very very much .
veronica malave , caracas , venezuela we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , uk the holy father is a special man .
he is god 's voice on earth and now he is going home to jesus .
we will light a candle for him at mass with father simon .
matthew -lrb- 11 -rrb- and patrick -lrb- 9 -rrb- , portsmouth , uk i thank the holy father for his teachings to the world to reach out to all ; even in his passing he is doing so .
i pray that the light of heaven shine upon his face and the lord removes all his pain .
may the world take onboard his teachings that we are all brothers and sisters no mater our colour , religion or nationality .
even if we disagree on some issues we should be able to discuss them but still embrace each other as pope john paul ii has .
thank you for calling out to all in the world papa .
melissa , scotland just because the pope was give the last rites does not necessarily mean that the pope is going to die .
the last rites can be re-written and i think that as long as we all continue to pray for the pope 's recovery and never believe he will die soon , then he will recover with god 's grace .
amen .
joel collins , wolverhampton , england i love you pope , i am a shia muslim , and i want you to know that you are as loved as i love and respect ayatollah al-sistani .
adam bayzar , pleasanton , ca , usa i 've been in st peter 's square .
you have to listen to the silence to understand the message he 's leaving us ...
alex , rome , italy this man was everything to us .
pawel , poland pope 's last moments are very painful for the lovers of peace .
the world will remember this great soul as symbol of peace , integrity and brotherhood .
he was not only good to catholics and christians but equally good for the whole humankind .
may god give him eternal peace ?
dr m ashaq raza , asmara , eritrea i am a christian but by no means am i a catholic ; however there is something in the deeds of good men that transcends denomination .
i might disagree with his position doctrinally , yet he continually fought for good which is as much as anyone can do , in this i hope he may be an example to us all .
owen griffiths , bradford , uk this man truly has walked in the lord 's footsteps and has followed the apostolic succession of st peter with zeal and courage .
we admire him in his suffering as we did when he held a koala in 1986 .
god bless this most humble and holiest of men .
michael hunter , north melbourne , victoria , australia polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay mateusz olejniczak , zielona last night every single house was empty .
everyone had gone to church to pray for the pope .
we do n't want him to leave but he seems different .
remember that posted note ?
" i 'm happy .
be happy too .
i 'm leaving everything to sacred maiden maria " - so he actually wants to die and meet god in person .
polish people do n't want him to leave ... but we ca n't make him stay .
he 's getting closer to god every second .
mateusz olejniczak , zielona , poland i am a muslim and i am saddened by recent developments .
but it is allah 's will and we all pray that if he is to go , he go peacefully .
bilal patel , london , uk what do you need the comments for ?
our great pope is going through one life to another .
respect this event and do not cause a sensation , please .
zbigniew zdziennicki , lodz , poland we are three teenagers and you are our pope .
we will miss you .
even if you die , your great actions will remain forever .
high school students emanuele , monica and silvia , messina , italy i had the very great privilege of meeting the pope in the late 70s at a huge youth rally in rome .
many thousands of us gathered together , singing joyous songs .
pope john paul ii was moved to see so many young persons .
i kissed pope john paul 's hand and received his blessing .
my prayers and thoughts are with pope john paul ii at this very sad time .
carole middleton , cambridge , uk he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him patrick n chkaibam , fanar as the final hours of his wonderful life tick away and before the curtains of his life close , i ca n't but think about jean paul 's ii modesty , his wonderful and warm smile .
he was close to all different religions .
he went to see the poor who could n't come and see him .
as a lebanese christian i would never forget the joy on the day i saw him in lebanon and even muslims felt the same way .
he is a leader that would come once every thousand of years .
it would be hard to find someone who can fill his shoes .
please have mercy on his pure soul and let him be with you in your everlasting kingdom .
patrick n chkaibam , fanar , lebanon i went to vatican and it is a heart throbbing experience as the faithful join in prayer for the pope .
he left us all a wonderful personal experience which lacks words to explain .
biji , rome , italy hold on holy father , you are not alone in this state ; we are all with you in prayers .
may the almighty god who has seen you through your years of life sustain you and if the time has truly come for you to be with him in his eternal glory , may you be received peacefully .
god be with you papa .
jude lagbeneku , accra , ghana i am very sad because we are losing the pope of the young .
god bless you .
italo , ripatransone , italy i am deeply saddened to hear that pope john paul ii has received the last rites and that his health is in a critical state .
he is truly the bravest and most devoted man in history and although he will be greatly missed , i wish him peace in the arms of our father .
nicole , surrey i find it amazing , that with the terri schiavo debate raging that no one has drawn a parallel to the pope 's situation .
he has the luxury of opting not to go into hospital , where they would most probably put him on life support when necessary , and he to could live in a vegetative state indefinitely .
is n't it hypocritical of him , as leader of the catholic church , not to himself live by the by all means possible - any state of life is sacred rule ?
is n't he fortunate to have the choice that many do n't have .
sally krantz , hong kong to sally krantz , hong kong : the pope is not , like the unfortunate terri schiavo , in a permanent vegetative state .
he has been mentally alert but physically ailing for many years .
neither was the physically well but brain damaged terri schiavo on life support ; neither was she 84-years-old .
the pope is simply old , ill , and at natural end of his life .
surely choice is irrelevant in this context ?
please examine the facts more closely before drawing weak comparisons .
lucy , london i am not a roman catholic but i strongly believe that the doors of heaven have been opened for the very peaceful soul of the 84-year-old pontiff - pope john paul ii .
amudala satyanarayana , tirupati , india i say to the pope , " god be with you " .
however i am very much surprised by the reaction of many people from the west who think the pope is the only person dying today .
at 80-something more so .
please why do n't you react the same way towards the thousands dying in africa through hiv / aids ?
you really surprise me , people .
but to the pope my heart pains , for i believe you are like your god .
isheunesu abusa , harare , zimbabwe i am very touched by what is happening to the pope .
while i know that his health is in critical condition , i still wish he gets out of it .
i pray for him so that he goes in peace and with less suffering .
as a child , i was blessed by the pope when he came to my country years ago .
thank you for all what you have done in this world .
i believe that the pope is one of the greatest men of our time .
god bless you .
damien sholay , rose-hill , mauritius we watch him suffer and it is sad , such a blessed man who has the world 's integrity .
we thank god for his life .
nono , south africa , johannesburg this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii richard macdonald , usa while i wish it was n't true , i fear that the last moments of his holiness are at hand .
this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii .
as a catholic i can say we have been honoured to have him as our spiritual leader .
thank you for all that you have done your holiness .
god bless you .
richard macdonald , cherry hill , nj , usa i feel very sad that the pope is critically ill .
i can still vividly picture him celebrating the eucharist on the mount of beatitudes in israel in the jubilee year 2000 .
indeed , the pope is a great living saint , a suffering servant of god who has touched millions of lives .
god love you , john paul ii .
linus lee , singapore i am very moved by the courage and willpower of the pope and his serenity in face of suffering and death .
this is an encouragement to all of us in times of facing loss and grief .
thank you for such a positive article on bbc news .
anne marie farrell , london , uk he was elected pope months after i was born .
i saw him in poland on one of his first visits .
although i no longer practice catholicism , i am very saddened to see him go .
i have always admired his strength and uncompromising belief in the worth of every human life .
his commitment to his values , no matter how much i disagree with some of them , is admirable in this age of world leaders who change their minds with every blow of the political wind .
may he have a peaceful passing .
joanna , philadelphia , usa a sad day approaching , i 'm not a religious person but i 'm feeling sad that such a humble man who gave his love to everyone regardless of religion is soon to leave us and take his chair alongside the almighty .
god bless you john paul .
alan richardson , dudley , west midlands he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths robin , cochin , india i had the opportunity to see the pope in person when he visited india for the first time .
a person with the highest regard for human life .
he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths .
the holy father has great regard for the human life and values which was reflected in his sermons on various occasions .
some times he was criticised for being against abortion and euthanasia .
never the less he has maintained cordial relation with his detractors as well as with followers of different faiths .
the world will remember him for ever for his good deeds and clear convictions on various issues which he has held close to his chest .
may god support him in his arms till he joins the eternal father .
robin , cochin , india having read the comments sent in i find it incredible that so many people of different faiths or no faith respect and indeed love the pope .
to me it reveals how he succeeded in his mission to communicate with all people .
throughout his papacy he stressed communication and love : both seem to have won through .
i hope the suffering ends soon and he can be at peace with his maker laura the pope has indeed been a spiritual giant and a great , great leader in many areas .
the biggest blot on his record in my opinion is his stand against the use of condoms to combat aids .
he has been quite flatly wrong and there are and will be many dead as a result of his insistence on what he has seen as faithful doctrine .
may his successor be as principled and as much a force for good as this man has been , but with the ability to adapt his dogma to the realities of a suffering world .
rosemary , copenhagen , denmark he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are carmelina degiorgio , malta everyone one loves him and i bet he is in everyone 's prayers .
he did a lot of good , he was a good man and loved and forgave everyone .
he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are .
i had the occasion to see him twice when he came on a visit to malta , and i went once to rome and saw him in his balcony .
i will pray for him .
carmelina degiorgio , malta i was there on easter sunday to feel the warmth and affection of the multitude of people when the pope appeared for four minutes at the window in st peter 's square ; he was in tears , so was everyone in the crowd , looking at him .
it was a very moving experience .
his legacy would be unsurpassed for a long time to come .
zac j zacharias , new york , usa whatever your views on the catholic church , pope john paul is a rarity in our group of world leaders , in that he is totally committed to his beliefs and totally open and honest about them .

he has the luxury of opting not to go into hospital , where they would most probably put him on life support when necessary , and he to could live in a vegetative state indefinitely .
is n't it hypocritical of him , as leader of the catholic church , not to himself live by the by all means possible - any state of life is sacred rule ?
is n't he fortunate to have the choice that many do n't have .
sally krantz , hong kong to sally krantz , hong kong : the pope is not , like the unfortunate terri schiavo , in a permanent vegetative state .
he has been mentally alert but physically ailing for many years .
neither was the physically well but brain damaged terri schiavo on life support ; neither was she 84-years-old .
the pope is simply old , ill , and at natural end of his life .
surely choice is irrelevant in this context ?
please examine the facts more closely before drawing weak comparisons .
lucy , london i am not a roman catholic but i strongly believe that the doors of heaven have been opened for the very peaceful soul of the 84-year-old pontiff - pope john paul ii .
amudala satyanarayana , tirupati , india i say to the pope , " god be with you " .
however i am very much surprised by the reaction of many people from the west who think the pope is the only person dying today .
at 80-something more so .
please why do n't you react the same way towards the thousands dying in africa through hiv / aids ?
you really surprise me , people .
but to the pope my heart pains , for i believe you are like your god .
isheunesu abusa , harare , zimbabwe i am very touched by what is happening to the pope .
while i know that his health is in critical condition , i still wish he gets out of it .
i pray for him so that he goes in peace and with less suffering .
as a child , i was blessed by the pope when he came to my country years ago .
thank you for all what you have done in this world .
i believe that the pope is one of the greatest men of our time .
god bless you .
damien sholay , rose-hill , mauritius we watch him suffer and it is sad , such a blessed man who has the world 's integrity .
we thank god for his life .
nono , south africa , johannesburg " this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii " richard macdonald , usa while i wish it was n't true , i fear that the last moments of his holiness are at hand .
this world is a better place because of the untiring efforts of john paul ii .
as a catholic i can say we have been honoured to have him as our spiritual leader .
thank you for all that you have done your holiness .
god bless you .
richard macdonald , cherry hill , nj , usa i feel very sad that the pope is critically ill .
i can still vividly picture him celebrating the eucharist on the mount of beatitudes in israel in the jubilee year 2000 .
indeed , the pope is a great living saint , a suffering servant of god who has touched millions of lives .
god love you , john paul ii .
linus lee , singapore i am very moved by the courage and willpower of the pope and his serenity in face of suffering and death .
this is an encouragement to all of us in times of facing loss and grief .
thank you for such a positive article on bbc news .
anne marie farrell , london , uk he was elected pope months after i was born .
i saw him in poland on one of his first visits .
although i no longer practice catholicism , i am very saddened to see him go .
i have always admired his strength and uncompromising belief in the worth of every human life .
his commitment to his values , no matter how much i disagree with some of them , is admirable in this age of world leaders who change their minds with every blow of the political wind .
may he have a peaceful passing .
joanna , philadelphia , usa a sad day approaching , i 'm not a religious person but i 'm feeling sad that such a humble man who gave his love to everyone regardless of religion is soon to leave us and take his chair alongside the almighty .
god bless you john paul .
alan richardson , dudley , west midlands " he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths " robin , cochin , india i had the opportunity to see the pope in person when he visited india for the first time .
a person with the highest regard for human life .
he will be remembered for his endeavours in bringing together various christian faiths .
the holy father has great regard for the human life and values which was reflected in his sermons on various occasions .
some times he was criticised for being against abortion and euthanasia .
never the less he has maintained cordial relation with his detractors as well as with followers of different faiths .
the world will remember him for ever for his good deeds and clear convictions on various issues which he has held close to his chest .
may god support him in his arms till he joins the eternal father .
robin , cochin , india having read the comments sent in i find it incredible that so many people of different faiths or no faith respect and indeed love the pope .
to me it reveals how he succeeded in his mission to communicate with all people .
throughout his papacy he stressed communication and love : both seem to have won through .
i hope the suffering ends soon and he can be at peace with his maker laura the pope has indeed been a spiritual giant and a great , great leader in many areas .
the biggest blot on his record in my opinion is his stand against the use of condoms to combat aids .
he has been quite flatly wrong and there are and will be many dead as a result of his insistence on what he has seen as faithful doctrine .
may his successor be as principled and as much a force for good as this man has been , but with the ability to adapt his dogma to the realities of a suffering world .
rosemary , copenhagen , denmark " he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are " carmelina degiorgio , malta everyone one loves him and i bet he is in everyone 's prayers .
he did a lot of good , he was a good man and loved and forgave everyone .
he loved every one of us no matter what religion you are .
i had the occasion to see him twice when he came on a visit to malta , and i went once to rome and saw him in his balcony .
i will pray for him .
carmelina degiorgio , malta i was there on easter sunday to feel the warmth and affection of the multitude of people when the pope appeared for four minutes at the window in st peter 's square ; he was in tears , so was everyone in the crowd , looking at him .
it was a very moving experience .
his legacy would be unsurpassed for a long time to come .
zac j zacharias , new york , usa whatever your views on the catholic church , pope john paul is a rarity in our group of world leaders , in that he is totally committed to his beliefs and totally open and honest about them .
neil small , scotland a truly great person full of genuine compassion whose goodness has been the hallmark of his entire life : a serenity reflected in health and in sickness .
his impending passing away will be mourned the world over by catholics and non-catholics of every persuasion .
pancha chandra , brussels , belgium holy father may god be waiting for you with open arms .
you have been a great inspiration to people all over the world and when they could n't get to you - you came to them .
i will always remember with great fondness the day you visited us in glasgow .
it is a day i will never forget - it was a glorious day in every way .
kay , haddington , east lothian as an observant jew , i would like to offer my prayers on this shabbat for the pope and for all catholics .
the current pope was not only a friend to the jewish people , whom he helped to rescue while in poland , but a friend to all humanity .
shimon cohen , new york , ny usa john paul ii continues to teach us even as he falls silent .
he is now showing how universal his message is , and how united the church stands behind him .
to him and to all his vatican colleagues , we say from the bottom of our heart , " thank you ! "
jy man , hong kong pope john paul ii is a wonderful human being ; i am very sad for him .
he will be dearly missed in this world .
i pray that he is not in any pain and that he dies in peace .
god bless you pope john paul - may god be with you .

lambeth council would not allow the seventh annual event to be held in brockwell park , brixton , because of drug dealers at previous festivals .

in the piazza , the atmosphere has been transformed and there is almost a sense of celebration .
inside the vast basilica , the heart of the catholic church , a mass is being held .
outside , people are speaking of everything that pope john paul has achieved in his papacy of nearly 27 years .
young italians wearing yellow bandanas carried a barrier reading : " you called us and so we are here " as they made their way towards the piazza .
young pilgrims the arrival of so many young people has sparked a shift in mood as the mumbled , tense prayers of the morning are replaced by enthusiastic chanting of the pope 's name .
they call " gio-van-ni pau-lo !
gio-van-ni pau-lo " in unison towards the window where he drifts in and out of consciousness , almost as though the sound of their voices will give him strength .
he was always so focused on youth emanuele imondi -lrb- right -rrb- student " he has been very close to us children , " said eight-year-old federica corti , as her fingers fiddled with a string of rosary beads .
" he always said that whenever he was with children , he too would feel young , " she said .
thirty-three-year-old simone luciani said the pope , known to italians as papa giovanni , had taken a new approach to spreading faith .
" he spoke directly to young people .
the future of the church is with us and he made a whole generation much closer to the church , " simone said .
message papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said on saturday morning that the pope had tried to speak a few words in the early hours of the day , and had been made aware of the thousands of young people who had gathered to pray for him .
" in fact , he seemed to be referring to them when ... he seemed to have said the following sentence : ' i have looked for you .
now you have come to me .
and i thank you ' , " the spokesman said .
as if responding to this message , throughout the afternoon hundreds have surged onto the square , mothers pushing young children in prams , elderly couples holding hands and huddles of nuns glad to be present at this moment .
the pilgrims now stand facing the papal apartments , looking upwards towards the window where pope john paul appeared so many times to address believers .
there are many here but ... we are all joined together in thinking of him sister eva hermana " he is my next-door neighbour , " said 60-year-old giuseppe parti , who lives near the vatican .
" i 'm not a particularly religious man , but i feel geographically , physically and spiritually close to him . "

in the piazza , the atmosphere has been transformed and there is almost a sense of celebration .
inside the vast basilica , the heart of the catholic church , a mass is being held .
outside , people are speaking of everything that pope john paul has achieved in his papacy of nearly 27 years .
young italians wearing yellow bandanas carried a barrier reading : " you called us and so we are here " as they made their way towards the piazza .
young pilgrims the arrival of so many young people has sparked a shift in mood as the mumbled , tense prayers of the morning are replaced by enthusiastic chanting of the pope 's name .
they call " gio-van-ni pau-lo !
gio-van-ni pau-lo " in unison towards the window where he drifts in and out of consciousness , almost as though the sound of their voices will give him strength .
he was always so focused on youth emanuele imondi -lrb- right -rrb- student " he has been very close to us children , " said eight-year-old federica corti , as her fingers fiddled with a string of rosary beads .

thirty-three-year-old simone luciani said the pope , known to italians as papa giovanni , had taken a new approach to spreading faith .
" he spoke directly to young people .
the future of the church is with us and he made a whole generation much closer to the church , " simone said .
message papal spokesman joaquin navarro-valls said on saturday morning that the pope had tried to speak a few words in the early hours of the day , and had been made aware of the thousands of young people who had gathered to pray for him .
" in fact , he seemed to be referring to them when ... he seemed to have said the following sentence : ' i have looked for you .
now you have come to me .
and i thank you ' , " the spokesman said .
as if responding to this message , throughout the afternoon hundreds have surged onto the square , mothers pushing young children in prams , elderly couples holding hands and huddles of nuns glad to be present at this moment .
the pilgrims now stand facing the papal apartments , looking upwards towards the window where pope john paul appeared so many times to address believers .
there are many here but ... we are all joined together in thinking of him sister eva hermana " he is my next-door neighbour , " said 60-year-old giuseppe parti , who lives near the vatican .
