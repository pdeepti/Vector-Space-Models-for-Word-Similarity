program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .

that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

some of them have pinned their hopes on the " ispo 2005 " trade fair . the snowboard boom has abated and after the recent carving craze , snow enthusiasts already have a pair or two of the short , shaped skis , while less frequent skiers rent the newest models for their winter holidays . " competition is brutal , " said gerald palm from austrian ski manufacturer fischer . since 2001 , the winter sport sector has been ailing .
last year alone , turnover slipped by 2 percent to € 6.97 billion -lrb- $ 8.96 billion -rrb- .
but the world 's biggest sports goods trade fair , " ispo 2005 , " in munich from feb .
6-9 , could help breath life into the industry , where hopes are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski racer alois vogl won at world cup slalom in jan .
in november and december turnover climbed , and werner haizmann , head of germany 's sports retail association , said he was optimistic . " the recent world cup victories by max rauffer and alois vogl will restore skiing 's upwards motion , " he said . no snow , no business but weak consumer spending in germany has little to do with the slump in winter sports goods sales . " the margins in ski production are relatively small , " said peter thürl from the sports retailers ' group .
" the price ceiling for a pair of skis is quickly reached as a winter vacation is generally very expensive .
then the buyer is n't prepared to shell out lots of money for a pair of skis as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snowy winters bring profits and unlike other industries , the sports goods sector is entirely dependent on the weather . " if it does n't snow enough before christmas , no one buys skis at all , " thürl said .
" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .
us company quicksilver has shown determined interest in leading french brand rossignol .
rumors have been circulating that salomon , also french , will shift ski production to romania .
and germany 's völkl may face a similar scenario .
california 's k2 sports , which now owns the company , plans to move ski production from straubing , in bavaria , to china . but former slalom world champion frank wörndl , who works for völkl , said production would n't leave straubing .
if the company remained the most innovative ski manufacturer , and continued offering sophisticated handcrafting , the bavarian town would keep its jobs , wörndl said .
besides , he added , " many buyers still value ' made in germany . " ' ina rottscheidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german fitness trend makes strides nordic walking is booming in germany .

that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .

" i think there 's a good-faith effort under way by our european allies to try to resolve this issue diplomatically .
we support that effort , " cheney said in an interview with fox news sunday . " the iranians , i think , should do the right thing , and they should , in fact , agree to transparency , reassure the outside world that they are not trying to acquire nuclear weapons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice in germany with chancellor gerhard schröder cheney ’ s words echo those of us secretary state condoleezza rice , who was in london and berlin last week to reassure european leaders that washington is behind the eu in continuing to pursue diplomatic solutions to the iran nuclear standoff .
military action against iran is “ not on the agenda at the moment , ” she said in response to concern on this side of the atlantic that the us may be preparing a show of force to coerce tehran into abandoning its nuclear program . room for negotiation ? the us , which has not always seen eye-to-eye with europe on the nuclear issue , is convinced iran is using its civilian nuclear program as a guise to develop atomic weapons .
referring to the islamic republic as one of the central forces in the “ axis of evil , ” cheney and us president george w. bush have made no secret of their impatience with tehran .
europe , however , has argued for continuing diplomatic measures . it seems the us may now be willing to wait out the negotiations . " -lrb- the iranians -rrb- know very well that we do not want them to acquire nuclear weapons , nor does the civilized world , " the vice president said .
" i ca n't think of anybody who 's eager to see the iranians develop that kind of capability . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from iran , germany , france and britain meet to discuss tehran 's nuclear program " now , we are moving to support efforts to resolve it diplomatically , " cheney said in a nod towards current efforts by britain , france and germany to offer iran trade and development assistance in return for suspending all uranium enrichment-related activities . leaving options open the iran-eu talks began in brussels in december , moved to geneva in january and are scheduled to resume tuesday in geneva , according to diplomats . " if this process breaks down , the next step probably is to go back to the board of governors of the international atomic energy agency and ultimately refer to the united nations security council for the imposition of international sanctions on iran . " there are a number of steps here to be considered .

six games including the opening and closing ceremonies and the final are set to take place in berlin next summer .
the usual moaning over the cash-strapped city 's staggering € 60-billion -lrb- $ 77.23 billion -rrb- debts and its embarrassing failed bid to host the 2000 olympics has been replaced by a new industrious spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lehrter railway station during an early construction phase in 2002 berlin 's legendary olympia stadium has received a € 250 million facelift and the gigantic glass-domed central railway station is being readied to welcome the world .
city authorities expect a million foreign world cup tourists next year , taking berlin 's existing tourism record to new highs . with 13 million foreign guests - mainly from britain and the us - visiting the city last year , berlin is now the third most popular tourist destination in europe after london and paris . but amidst the world cup hoopla and marketing campaigns , there 's little talk of improving the city 's international image , particularly when it comes to catering to the needs of the english-speaking traveler . city in need of reality check i realized belatedly that a cold , rainy monday morning probably was n't the best time to carry out a reality check posing as an english-speaking tourist , given the fabled links between the weather and its effect on germans ' disposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english still is n't spoken within berlin 's u-bahn system at alexanderplatz , the main transport hub in the eastern part of the city , i waited ten minutes in line to speak to two scowling officials of berlin 's unpopular bvg company that runs the underground train network , bus and tram system .
but once i got to their window that read " tickets and more ” and " city tour and welcome card available here , ” they abruptly killed my first attempt at undercover journalism with an " englisch ?
nein , nein . ” it seems they had n't heard berlin 's politicians gushing about tourism and particularly the world cup " providing an adrenalin shot for the city 's economy . " marco fereira , a 19-year-old brazilian studying in london who was in berlin for two days , was also in the line and ended up ticket-less . " it 's a bit frustrating , " he said .
" i do n't have the " lonely planet " with me which has all that info .
all i want to know is which ticket 's the best .
the touch screen machines down in the underground do n't explain -lrb- in english -rrb- how long the various tickets are valid . ” is that our train ? after a few variations of the alexanderplatz scene with more misses than hits in buses , a tram and with two cab drivers on prime touristy stretches , i tried the zoo station , one of the main railway stations used daily by hundreds of tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit -lrb- center -rrb- as a train conductor skirting the long lines for information , i had a particularly bruising encounter with an official at the customer service counter of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway , who failed to understand that i could n't read her german " no service at this counter at the moment " sign . diane rawley and her husband timothy from england , who were trying to locate the tourist information center , -lrb- which as it happens is n't directly in the zoo station -rrb- said that berlin was " fascinating " and " quite friendly .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .

bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.02.2005 snow business melting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already out of fashion for four meager years , the winter sports sector has been asking itself where all the spend-happy consumers have gone .
some of them have pinned their hopes on the " ispo 2005 " trade fair . the snowboard boom has abated and after the recent carving craze , snow enthusiasts already have a pair or two of the short , shaped skis , while less frequent skiers rent the newest models for their winter holidays . " competition is brutal , " said gerald palm from austrian ski manufacturer fischer . since 2001 , the winter sport sector has been ailing .
last year alone , turnover slipped by 2 percent to € 6.97 billion -lrb- $ 8.96 billion -rrb- .
but the world 's biggest sports goods trade fair , " ispo 2005 , " in munich from feb .
6-9 , could help breath life into the industry , where hopes are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski racer alois vogl won at world cup slalom in jan .
in november and december turnover climbed , and werner haizmann , head of germany 's sports retail association , said he was optimistic . " the recent world cup victories by max rauffer and alois vogl will restore skiing 's upwards motion , " he said . no snow , no business but weak consumer spending in germany has little to do with the slump in winter sports goods sales . " the margins in ski production are relatively small , " said peter thürl from the sports retailers ' group .
" the price ceiling for a pair of skis is quickly reached as a winter vacation is generally very expensive .
then the buyer is n't prepared to shell out lots of money for a pair of skis as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snowy winters bring profits and unlike other industries , the sports goods sector is entirely dependent on the weather . " if it does n't snow enough before christmas , no one buys skis at all , " thürl said .
" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .

that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .

as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.02.2005 snow business melting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : already out of fashion for four meager years , the winter sports sector has been asking itself where all the spend-happy consumers have gone .
some of them have pinned their hopes on the " ispo 2005 " trade fair . the snowboard boom has abated and after the recent carving craze , snow enthusiasts already have a pair or two of the short , shaped skis , while less frequent skiers rent the newest models for their winter holidays . " competition is brutal , " said gerald palm from austrian ski manufacturer fischer . since 2001 , the winter sport sector has been ailing .
last year alone , turnover slipped by 2 percent to € 6.97 billion -lrb- $ 8.96 billion -rrb- .
but the world 's biggest sports goods trade fair , " ispo 2005 , " in munich from feb .
6-9 , could help breath life into the industry , where hopes are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski racer alois vogl won at world cup slalom in jan .
in november and december turnover climbed , and werner haizmann , head of germany 's sports retail association , said he was optimistic . " the recent world cup victories by max rauffer and alois vogl will restore skiing 's upwards motion , " he said . no snow , no business but weak consumer spending in germany has little to do with the slump in winter sports goods sales . " the margins in ski production are relatively small , " said peter thürl from the sports retailers ' group .
" the price ceiling for a pair of skis is quickly reached as a winter vacation is generally very expensive .
then the buyer is n't prepared to shell out lots of money for a pair of skis as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snowy winters bring profits and unlike other industries , the sports goods sector is entirely dependent on the weather . " if it does n't snow enough before christmas , no one buys skis at all , " thürl said .
" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .
us company quicksilver has shown determined interest in leading french brand rossignol .
rumors have been circulating that salomon , also french , will shift ski production to romania .
and germany 's völkl may face a similar scenario .
california 's k2 sports , which now owns the company , plans to move ski production from straubing , in bavaria , to china . but former slalom world champion frank wörndl , who works for völkl , said production would n't leave straubing .
if the company remained the most innovative ski manufacturer , and continued offering sophisticated handcrafting , the bavarian town would keep its jobs , wörndl said .
besides , he added , " many buyers still value ' made in germany . " ' ina rottscheidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german fitness trend makes strides nordic walking is booming in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .

" i think there 's a good-faith effort under way by our european allies to try to resolve this issue diplomatically .
we support that effort , " cheney said in an interview with fox news sunday . " the iranians , i think , should do the right thing , and they should , in fact , agree to transparency , reassure the outside world that they are not trying to acquire nuclear weapons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice in germany with chancellor gerhard schröder cheney ’ s words echo those of us secretary state condoleezza rice , who was in london and berlin last week to reassure european leaders that washington is behind the eu in continuing to pursue diplomatic solutions to the iran nuclear standoff .
military action against iran is “ not on the agenda at the moment , ” she said in response to concern on this side of the atlantic that the us may be preparing a show of force to coerce tehran into abandoning its nuclear program . room for negotiation ? the us , which has not always seen eye-to-eye with europe on the nuclear issue , is convinced iran is using its civilian nuclear program as a guise to develop atomic weapons .
referring to the islamic republic as one of the central forces in the “ axis of evil , ” cheney and us president george w. bush have made no secret of their impatience with tehran .
europe , however , has argued for continuing diplomatic measures . it seems the us may now be willing to wait out the negotiations . " -lrb- the iranians -rrb- know very well that we do not want them to acquire nuclear weapons , nor does the civilized world , " the vice president said .
" i ca n't think of anybody who 's eager to see the iranians develop that kind of capability . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from iran , germany , france and britain meet to discuss tehran 's nuclear program " now , we are moving to support efforts to resolve it diplomatically , " cheney said in a nod towards current efforts by britain , france and germany to offer iran trade and development assistance in return for suspending all uranium enrichment-related activities . leaving options open the iran-eu talks began in brussels in december , moved to geneva in january and are scheduled to resume tuesday in geneva , according to diplomats . " if this process breaks down , the next step probably is to go back to the board of governors of the international atomic energy agency and ultimately refer to the united nations security council for the imposition of international sanctions on iran . " there are a number of steps here to be considered .
we have not eliminated any alternative at this point , but we obviously are seriously pursuing diplomatic resolution of this problem , " cheney said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says strike on iran a mistake a military strike against iran ’ s nuclear facilities would be a “ mistake , ” the european union ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana said and stressed the importance of continuing eu efforts at diplomatic engagement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .

six games including the opening and closing ceremonies and the final are set to take place in berlin next summer .
the usual moaning over the cash-strapped city 's staggering € 60-billion -lrb- $ 77.23 billion -rrb- debts and its embarrassing failed bid to host the 2000 olympics has been replaced by a new industrious spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lehrter railway station during an early construction phase in 2002 berlin 's legendary olympia stadium has received a € 250 million facelift and the gigantic glass-domed central railway station is being readied to welcome the world .
city authorities expect a million foreign world cup tourists next year , taking berlin 's existing tourism record to new highs . with 13 million foreign guests - mainly from britain and the us - visiting the city last year , berlin is now the third most popular tourist destination in europe after london and paris . but amidst the world cup hoopla and marketing campaigns , there 's little talk of improving the city 's international image , particularly when it comes to catering to the needs of the english-speaking traveler . city in need of reality check i realized belatedly that a cold , rainy monday morning probably was n't the best time to carry out a reality check posing as an english-speaking tourist , given the fabled links between the weather and its effect on germans ' disposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english still is n't spoken within berlin 's u-bahn system at alexanderplatz , the main transport hub in the eastern part of the city , i waited ten minutes in line to speak to two scowling officials of berlin 's unpopular bvg company that runs the underground train network , bus and tram system .
but once i got to their window that read " tickets and more ” and " city tour and welcome card available here , ” they abruptly killed my first attempt at undercover journalism with an " englisch ?
nein , nein . ” it seems they had n't heard berlin 's politicians gushing about tourism and particularly the world cup " providing an adrenalin shot for the city 's economy . " marco fereira , a 19-year-old brazilian studying in london who was in berlin for two days , was also in the line and ended up ticket-less . " it 's a bit frustrating , " he said .
" i do n't have the " lonely planet " with me which has all that info .
all i want to know is which ticket 's the best .
the touch screen machines down in the underground do n't explain -lrb- in english -rrb- how long the various tickets are valid . ” is that our train ? after a few variations of the alexanderplatz scene with more misses than hits in buses , a tram and with two cab drivers on prime touristy stretches , i tried the zoo station , one of the main railway stations used daily by hundreds of tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit -lrb- center -rrb- as a train conductor skirting the long lines for information , i had a particularly bruising encounter with an official at the customer service counter of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway , who failed to understand that i could n't read her german " no service at this counter at the moment " sign . diane rawley and her husband timothy from england , who were trying to locate the tourist information center , -lrb- which as it happens is n't directly in the zoo station -rrb- said that berlin was " fascinating " and " quite friendly . "
but they added that if there was one thing they 'd like to see changed it would be the introduction of a few english language announcements at train stations . " we 're straining our ears trying to figure out whether that particularly long german announcement had anything to say about the train we 're waiting for , ” timothy rawley said .
" we 're worried we might miss something important like a delay or change in platform . ” " serious deficits " berlin 's tourism boss , hans peter nerger , who has admitted in the past that if it was up to him , he would prescribe crash courses in english for all of berlin 's service industry personnel , conceded " there are serious deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard " it 's not just about being able to speak english or french or italian .
it 's attitudes that need changing , ” said nerger , who pointed to the refusal of certain stores in tourist areas to accept credit cards as an example .
" after all , it 's well known that american tourists prefer to pay by card . ” but nerger , whose office runs three tourist information centers in the city where you can get a bagful of free brochures and book hotels but expect little by way of politeness -lrb- forget about a smile or an " enjoy your stay in berlin " -rrb- , said schemes like the one announced by madrid - future cab drivers in the spanish capital will have to learn english as part of the city 's 2012 olympics bid - would never work in berlin . getting better but not quite there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love parade in berlin of course , things are n't all bad .
department stores like the famous kadewe have personnel fluent in five languages and many restaurants too now print their menus in english .
most visitors take back overwhelmingly positive impressions with them reinforced by the city 's relatively low prices , its café and party culture - as well as its remarkably efficient transport system despite all the gruffness . " there 's a general lack of information in english in museums and the like but it 's all so much better than it was a few years ago , " said francis hartnett , owner of insider tour , a company organizing english-language tours .
" there are definitely fewer complaints now from tourists .
many are also much more well-traveled nowadays , many of them have been to eastern europe so berlin is n't bad .
paris is probably more unfriendly . " it may not be the most flattering of comparisons , but there 's general agreement that berlin could do more to spiff up its international image . petra reetz , spokeswoman for the bvg company , summed it up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : bundesliga 2004/05 : the season so far bremen wins opener delayed by blackout leverkusen go top as champions slip up champions extend winning streak all change in bundesliga title race sports -pipe- 07.02.2005 bayern strengthens lead atop bundesliga 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a draw with the league 's worst team left schalke holding their heads munich won at home against leverkusen , taking a step toward winning the german championship , and watched their closest competitors , schalke and stuttgart , struggle for draws in their attempts to move up the table . the bavarians increased their lead to three points over schalke , who tied the league 's worst placed team , hansa rostock 2:2 after leading at the end of the first half .
stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .
the win moved hamburg up two places to 7th and nuremberg down two to 13th .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .

hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .
the win moved hamburg up two places to 7th and nuremberg down two to 13th .

" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .

six games including the opening and closing ceremonies and the final are set to take place in berlin next summer .
the usual moaning over the cash-strapped city 's staggering € 60-billion -lrb- $ 77.23 billion -rrb- debts and its embarrassing failed bid to host the 2000 olympics has been replaced by a new industrious spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lehrter railway station during an early construction phase in 2002 berlin 's legendary olympia stadium has received a € 250 million facelift and the gigantic glass-domed central railway station is being readied to welcome the world .
city authorities expect a million foreign world cup tourists next year , taking berlin 's existing tourism record to new highs . with 13 million foreign guests - mainly from britain and the us - visiting the city last year , berlin is now the third most popular tourist destination in europe after london and paris . but amidst the world cup hoopla and marketing campaigns , there 's little talk of improving the city 's international image , particularly when it comes to catering to the needs of the english-speaking traveler . city in need of reality check i realized belatedly that a cold , rainy monday morning probably was n't the best time to carry out a reality check posing as an english-speaking tourist , given the fabled links between the weather and its effect on germans ' disposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english still is n't spoken within berlin 's u-bahn system at alexanderplatz , the main transport hub in the eastern part of the city , i waited ten minutes in line to speak to two scowling officials of berlin 's unpopular bvg company that runs the underground train network , bus and tram system .
but once i got to their window that read " tickets and more ” and " city tour and welcome card available here , ” they abruptly killed my first attempt at undercover journalism with an " englisch ?

" marco fereira , a 19-year-old brazilian studying in london who was in berlin for two days , was also in the line and ended up ticket-less . " it 's a bit frustrating , " he said .
" i do n't have the " lonely planet " with me which has all that info .
all i want to know is which ticket 's the best .
the touch screen machines down in the underground do n't explain -lrb- in english -rrb- how long the various tickets are valid . ” is that our train ? after a few variations of the alexanderplatz scene with more misses than hits in buses , a tram and with two cab drivers on prime touristy stretches , i tried the zoo station , one of the main railway stations used daily by hundreds of tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit -lrb- center -rrb- as a train conductor skirting the long lines for information , i had a particularly bruising encounter with an official at the customer service counter of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway , who failed to understand that i could n't read her german " no service at this counter at the moment " sign . diane rawley and her husband timothy from england , who were trying to locate the tourist information center , -lrb- which as it happens is n't directly in the zoo station -rrb- said that berlin was " fascinating " and " quite friendly . "
but they added that if there was one thing they 'd like to see changed it would be the introduction of a few english language announcements at train stations . " we 're straining our ears trying to figure out whether that particularly long german announcement had anything to say about the train we 're waiting for , ” timothy rawley said .
" we 're worried we might miss something important like a delay or change in platform . ” " serious deficits " berlin 's tourism boss , hans peter nerger , who has admitted in the past that if it was up to him , he would prescribe crash courses in english for all of berlin 's service industry personnel , conceded " there are serious deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard " it 's not just about being able to speak english or french or italian .
it 's attitudes that need changing , ” said nerger , who pointed to the refusal of certain stores in tourist areas to accept credit cards as an example .
" after all , it 's well known that american tourists prefer to pay by card . ” but nerger , whose office runs three tourist information centers in the city where you can get a bagful of free brochures and book hotels but expect little by way of politeness -lrb- forget about a smile or an " enjoy your stay in berlin " -rrb- , said schemes like the one announced by madrid - future cab drivers in the spanish capital will have to learn english as part of the city 's 2012 olympics bid - would never work in berlin . getting better but not quite there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love parade in berlin of course , things are n't all bad .
department stores like the famous kadewe have personnel fluent in five languages and many restaurants too now print their menus in english .
most visitors take back overwhelmingly positive impressions with them reinforced by the city 's relatively low prices , its café and party culture - as well as its remarkably efficient transport system despite all the gruffness . " there 's a general lack of information in english in museums and the like but it 's all so much better than it was a few years ago , " said francis hartnett , owner of insider tour , a company organizing english-language tours .
" there are definitely fewer complaints now from tourists .
many are also much more well-traveled nowadays , many of them have been to eastern europe so berlin is n't bad .

some of them have pinned their hopes on the " ispo 2005 " trade fair . the snowboard boom has abated and after the recent carving craze , snow enthusiasts already have a pair or two of the short , shaped skis , while less frequent skiers rent the newest models for their winter holidays . " competition is brutal , " said gerald palm from austrian ski manufacturer fischer . since 2001 , the winter sport sector has been ailing .
last year alone , turnover slipped by 2 percent to € 6.97 billion -lrb- $ 8.96 billion -rrb- .
but the world 's biggest sports goods trade fair , " ispo 2005 , " in munich from feb .
6-9 , could help breath life into the industry , where hopes are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski racer alois vogl won at world cup slalom in jan .
in november and december turnover climbed , and werner haizmann , head of germany 's sports retail association , said he was optimistic . " the recent world cup victories by max rauffer and alois vogl will restore skiing 's upwards motion , " he said . no snow , no business but weak consumer spending in germany has little to do with the slump in winter sports goods sales . " the margins in ski production are relatively small , " said peter thürl from the sports retailers ' group .
" the price ceiling for a pair of skis is quickly reached as a winter vacation is generally very expensive .
then the buyer is n't prepared to shell out lots of money for a pair of skis as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snowy winters bring profits and unlike other industries , the sports goods sector is entirely dependent on the weather . " if it does n't snow enough before christmas , no one buys skis at all , " thürl said .
" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .
us company quicksilver has shown determined interest in leading french brand rossignol .
rumors have been circulating that salomon , also french , will shift ski production to romania .
and germany 's völkl may face a similar scenario .
california 's k2 sports , which now owns the company , plans to move ski production from straubing , in bavaria , to china . but former slalom world champion frank wörndl , who works for völkl , said production would n't leave straubing .
if the company remained the most innovative ski manufacturer , and continued offering sophisticated handcrafting , the bavarian town would keep its jobs , wörndl said .
besides , he added , " many buyers still value ' made in germany . " ' ina rottscheidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german fitness trend makes strides nordic walking is booming in germany .
but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ?

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .

" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .
us company quicksilver has shown determined interest in leading french brand rossignol .
rumors have been circulating that salomon , also french , will shift ski production to romania .
and germany 's völkl may face a similar scenario .
california 's k2 sports , which now owns the company , plans to move ski production from straubing , in bavaria , to china . but former slalom world champion frank wörndl , who works for völkl , said production would n't leave straubing .
if the company remained the most innovative ski manufacturer , and continued offering sophisticated handcrafting , the bavarian town would keep its jobs , wörndl said .
besides , he added , " many buyers still value ' made in germany . " ' ina rottscheidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german fitness trend makes strides nordic walking is booming in germany .

all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .
the win moved hamburg up two places to 7th and nuremberg down two to 13th .

" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.02.2005 berlin 's english problem großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still a harsh environment for people who do n't speak german as berlin hopes to further boost foreign tourism ahead of the 2006 world cup , an undercover report by dw-world 's sonia phalnikar suggests that lacking language skills in the service sector might be the biggest problem . as the countdown to the 2006 soccer world cup begins , the german capital is buzzing with new-found confidence .
six games including the opening and closing ceremonies and the final are set to take place in berlin next summer .
the usual moaning over the cash-strapped city 's staggering € 60-billion -lrb- $ 77.23 billion -rrb- debts and its embarrassing failed bid to host the 2000 olympics has been replaced by a new industrious spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lehrter railway station during an early construction phase in 2002 berlin 's legendary olympia stadium has received a € 250 million facelift and the gigantic glass-domed central railway station is being readied to welcome the world .
city authorities expect a million foreign world cup tourists next year , taking berlin 's existing tourism record to new highs . with 13 million foreign guests - mainly from britain and the us - visiting the city last year , berlin is now the third most popular tourist destination in europe after london and paris . but amidst the world cup hoopla and marketing campaigns , there 's little talk of improving the city 's international image , particularly when it comes to catering to the needs of the english-speaking traveler . city in need of reality check i realized belatedly that a cold , rainy monday morning probably was n't the best time to carry out a reality check posing as an english-speaking tourist , given the fabled links between the weather and its effect on germans ' disposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english still is n't spoken within berlin 's u-bahn system at alexanderplatz , the main transport hub in the eastern part of the city , i waited ten minutes in line to speak to two scowling officials of berlin 's unpopular bvg company that runs the underground train network , bus and tram system .
but once i got to their window that read " tickets and more ” and " city tour and welcome card available here , ” they abruptly killed my first attempt at undercover journalism with an " englisch ?
nein , nein . ” it seems they had n't heard berlin 's politicians gushing about tourism and particularly the world cup " providing an adrenalin shot for the city 's economy . " marco fereira , a 19-year-old brazilian studying in london who was in berlin for two days , was also in the line and ended up ticket-less . " it 's a bit frustrating , " he said .
" i do n't have the " lonely planet " with me which has all that info .
all i want to know is which ticket 's the best .
the touch screen machines down in the underground do n't explain -lrb- in english -rrb- how long the various tickets are valid . ” is that our train ? after a few variations of the alexanderplatz scene with more misses than hits in buses , a tram and with two cab drivers on prime touristy stretches , i tried the zoo station , one of the main railway stations used daily by hundreds of tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit -lrb- center -rrb- as a train conductor skirting the long lines for information , i had a particularly bruising encounter with an official at the customer service counter of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway , who failed to understand that i could n't read her german " no service at this counter at the moment " sign . diane rawley and her husband timothy from england , who were trying to locate the tourist information center , -lrb- which as it happens is n't directly in the zoo station -rrb- said that berlin was " fascinating " and " quite friendly . "
but they added that if there was one thing they 'd like to see changed it would be the introduction of a few english language announcements at train stations . " we 're straining our ears trying to figure out whether that particularly long german announcement had anything to say about the train we 're waiting for , ” timothy rawley said .
" we 're worried we might miss something important like a delay or change in platform . ” " serious deficits " berlin 's tourism boss , hans peter nerger , who has admitted in the past that if it was up to him , he would prescribe crash courses in english for all of berlin 's service industry personnel , conceded " there are serious deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard " it 's not just about being able to speak english or french or italian .
it 's attitudes that need changing , ” said nerger , who pointed to the refusal of certain stores in tourist areas to accept credit cards as an example .
" after all , it 's well known that american tourists prefer to pay by card . ” but nerger , whose office runs three tourist information centers in the city where you can get a bagful of free brochures and book hotels but expect little by way of politeness -lrb- forget about a smile or an " enjoy your stay in berlin " -rrb- , said schemes like the one announced by madrid - future cab drivers in the spanish capital will have to learn english as part of the city 's 2012 olympics bid - would never work in berlin . getting better but not quite there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love parade in berlin of course , things are n't all bad .
department stores like the famous kadewe have personnel fluent in five languages and many restaurants too now print their menus in english .
most visitors take back overwhelmingly positive impressions with them reinforced by the city 's relatively low prices , its café and party culture - as well as its remarkably efficient transport system despite all the gruffness . " there 's a general lack of information in english in museums and the like but it 's all so much better than it was a few years ago , " said francis hartnett , owner of insider tour , a company organizing english-language tours .
" there are definitely fewer complaints now from tourists .
many are also much more well-traveled nowadays , many of them have been to eastern europe so berlin is n't bad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .

hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .

japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .

hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .
the win moved hamburg up two places to 7th and nuremberg down two to 13th .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .

that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

" if this process breaks down , the next step probably is to go back to the board of governors of the international atomic energy agency and ultimately refer to the united nations security council for the imposition of international sanctions on iran . " there are a number of steps here to be considered .
we have not eliminated any alternative at this point , but we obviously are seriously pursuing diplomatic resolution of this problem , " cheney said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says strike on iran a mistake a military strike against iran ’ s nuclear facilities would be a “ mistake , ” the european union ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana said and stressed the importance of continuing eu efforts at diplomatic engagement .

some of them have pinned their hopes on the " ispo 2005 " trade fair . the snowboard boom has abated and after the recent carving craze , snow enthusiasts already have a pair or two of the short , shaped skis , while less frequent skiers rent the newest models for their winter holidays . " competition is brutal , " said gerald palm from austrian ski manufacturer fischer . since 2001 , the winter sport sector has been ailing .
last year alone , turnover slipped by 2 percent to € 6.97 billion -lrb- $ 8.96 billion -rrb- .
but the world 's biggest sports goods trade fair , " ispo 2005 , " in munich from feb .
6-9 , could help breath life into the industry , where hopes are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski racer alois vogl won at world cup slalom in jan .
in november and december turnover climbed , and werner haizmann , head of germany 's sports retail association , said he was optimistic . " the recent world cup victories by max rauffer and alois vogl will restore skiing 's upwards motion , " he said . no snow , no business but weak consumer spending in germany has little to do with the slump in winter sports goods sales . " the margins in ski production are relatively small , " said peter thürl from the sports retailers ' group .
" the price ceiling for a pair of skis is quickly reached as a winter vacation is generally very expensive .
then the buyer is n't prepared to shell out lots of money for a pair of skis as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snowy winters bring profits and unlike other industries , the sports goods sector is entirely dependent on the weather . " if it does n't snow enough before christmas , no one buys skis at all , " thürl said .
" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .
us company quicksilver has shown determined interest in leading french brand rossignol .
rumors have been circulating that salomon , also french , will shift ski production to romania .
and germany 's völkl may face a similar scenario .
california 's k2 sports , which now owns the company , plans to move ski production from straubing , in bavaria , to china . but former slalom world champion frank wörndl , who works for völkl , said production would n't leave straubing .
if the company remained the most innovative ski manufacturer , and continued offering sophisticated handcrafting , the bavarian town would keep its jobs , wörndl said .
besides , he added , " many buyers still value ' made in germany . " ' ina rottscheidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german fitness trend makes strides nordic walking is booming in germany .
but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ?

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .
the win moved hamburg up two places to 7th and nuremberg down two to 13th .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .

hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .

six games including the opening and closing ceremonies and the final are set to take place in berlin next summer .
the usual moaning over the cash-strapped city 's staggering € 60-billion -lrb- $ 77.23 billion -rrb- debts and its embarrassing failed bid to host the 2000 olympics has been replaced by a new industrious spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lehrter railway station during an early construction phase in 2002 berlin 's legendary olympia stadium has received a € 250 million facelift and the gigantic glass-domed central railway station is being readied to welcome the world .
city authorities expect a million foreign world cup tourists next year , taking berlin 's existing tourism record to new highs . with 13 million foreign guests - mainly from britain and the us - visiting the city last year , berlin is now the third most popular tourist destination in europe after london and paris . but amidst the world cup hoopla and marketing campaigns , there 's little talk of improving the city 's international image , particularly when it comes to catering to the needs of the english-speaking traveler . city in need of reality check i realized belatedly that a cold , rainy monday morning probably was n't the best time to carry out a reality check posing as an english-speaking tourist , given the fabled links between the weather and its effect on germans ' disposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english still is n't spoken within berlin 's u-bahn system at alexanderplatz , the main transport hub in the eastern part of the city , i waited ten minutes in line to speak to two scowling officials of berlin 's unpopular bvg company that runs the underground train network , bus and tram system .
but once i got to their window that read " tickets and more ” and " city tour and welcome card available here , ” they abruptly killed my first attempt at undercover journalism with an " englisch ?

" i do n't have the " lonely planet " with me which has all that info .
all i want to know is which ticket 's the best .
the touch screen machines down in the underground do n't explain -lrb- in english -rrb- how long the various tickets are valid . ” is that our train ? after a few variations of the alexanderplatz scene with more misses than hits in buses , a tram and with two cab drivers on prime touristy stretches , i tried the zoo station , one of the main railway stations used daily by hundreds of tourists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin mayor klaus wowereit -lrb- center -rrb- as a train conductor skirting the long lines for information , i had a particularly bruising encounter with an official at the customer service counter of deutsche bahn , germany 's national railway , who failed to understand that i could n't read her german " no service at this counter at the moment " sign . diane rawley and her husband timothy from england , who were trying to locate the tourist information center , -lrb- which as it happens is n't directly in the zoo station -rrb- said that berlin was " fascinating " and " quite friendly . "
but they added that if there was one thing they 'd like to see changed it would be the introduction of a few english language announcements at train stations . " we 're straining our ears trying to figure out whether that particularly long german announcement had anything to say about the train we 're waiting for , ” timothy rawley said .
" we 're worried we might miss something important like a delay or change in platform . ” " serious deficits " berlin 's tourism boss , hans peter nerger , who has admitted in the past that if it was up to him , he would prescribe crash courses in english for all of berlin 's service industry personnel , conceded " there are serious deficits . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's kurfürstendamm shopping boulevard " it 's not just about being able to speak english or french or italian .
it 's attitudes that need changing , ” said nerger , who pointed to the refusal of certain stores in tourist areas to accept credit cards as an example .
" after all , it 's well known that american tourists prefer to pay by card . ” but nerger , whose office runs three tourist information centers in the city where you can get a bagful of free brochures and book hotels but expect little by way of politeness -lrb- forget about a smile or an " enjoy your stay in berlin " -rrb- , said schemes like the one announced by madrid - future cab drivers in the spanish capital will have to learn english as part of the city 's 2012 olympics bid - would never work in berlin . getting better but not quite there bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the love parade in berlin of course , things are n't all bad .
department stores like the famous kadewe have personnel fluent in five languages and many restaurants too now print their menus in english .
most visitors take back overwhelmingly positive impressions with them reinforced by the city 's relatively low prices , its café and party culture - as well as its remarkably efficient transport system despite all the gruffness . " there 's a general lack of information in english in museums and the like but it 's all so much better than it was a few years ago , " said francis hartnett , owner of insider tour , a company organizing english-language tours .
" there are definitely fewer complaints now from tourists .
many are also much more well-traveled nowadays , many of them have been to eastern europe so berlin is n't bad .
paris is probably more unfriendly . " it may not be the most flattering of comparisons , but there 's general agreement that berlin could do more to spiff up its international image . petra reetz , spokeswoman for the bvg company , summed it up .

six games including the opening and closing ceremonies and the final are set to take place in berlin next summer .
the usual moaning over the cash-strapped city 's staggering € 60-billion -lrb- $ 77.23 billion -rrb- debts and its embarrassing failed bid to host the 2000 olympics has been replaced by a new industrious spirit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the lehrter railway station during an early construction phase in 2002 berlin 's legendary olympia stadium has received a € 250 million facelift and the gigantic glass-domed central railway station is being readied to welcome the world .
city authorities expect a million foreign world cup tourists next year , taking berlin 's existing tourism record to new highs . with 13 million foreign guests - mainly from britain and the us - visiting the city last year , berlin is now the third most popular tourist destination in europe after london and paris . but amidst the world cup hoopla and marketing campaigns , there 's little talk of improving the city 's international image , particularly when it comes to catering to the needs of the english-speaking traveler . city in need of reality check i realized belatedly that a cold , rainy monday morning probably was n't the best time to carry out a reality check posing as an english-speaking tourist , given the fabled links between the weather and its effect on germans ' disposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : english still is n't spoken within berlin 's u-bahn system at alexanderplatz , the main transport hub in the eastern part of the city , i waited ten minutes in line to speak to two scowling officials of berlin 's unpopular bvg company that runs the underground train network , bus and tram system .
but once i got to their window that read " tickets and more ” and " city tour and welcome card available here , ” they abruptly killed my first attempt at undercover journalism with an " englisch ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .

gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .
the win moved hamburg up two places to 7th and nuremberg down two to 13th .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

some of them have pinned their hopes on the " ispo 2005 " trade fair . the snowboard boom has abated and after the recent carving craze , snow enthusiasts already have a pair or two of the short , shaped skis , while less frequent skiers rent the newest models for their winter holidays . " competition is brutal , " said gerald palm from austrian ski manufacturer fischer . since 2001 , the winter sport sector has been ailing .
last year alone , turnover slipped by 2 percent to € 6.97 billion -lrb- $ 8.96 billion -rrb- .
but the world 's biggest sports goods trade fair , " ispo 2005 , " in munich from feb .
6-9 , could help breath life into the industry , where hopes are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski racer alois vogl won at world cup slalom in jan .
in november and december turnover climbed , and werner haizmann , head of germany 's sports retail association , said he was optimistic . " the recent world cup victories by max rauffer and alois vogl will restore skiing 's upwards motion , " he said . no snow , no business but weak consumer spending in germany has little to do with the slump in winter sports goods sales . " the margins in ski production are relatively small , " said peter thürl from the sports retailers ' group .
" the price ceiling for a pair of skis is quickly reached as a winter vacation is generally very expensive .
then the buyer is n't prepared to shell out lots of money for a pair of skis as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snowy winters bring profits and unlike other industries , the sports goods sector is entirely dependent on the weather . " if it does n't snow enough before christmas , no one buys skis at all , " thürl said .
" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .
us company quicksilver has shown determined interest in leading french brand rossignol .
rumors have been circulating that salomon , also french , will shift ski production to romania .
and germany 's völkl may face a similar scenario .
california 's k2 sports , which now owns the company , plans to move ski production from straubing , in bavaria , to china . but former slalom world champion frank wörndl , who works for völkl , said production would n't leave straubing .
if the company remained the most innovative ski manufacturer , and continued offering sophisticated handcrafting , the bavarian town would keep its jobs , wörndl said .
besides , he added , " many buyers still value ' made in germany . " ' ina rottscheidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german fitness trend makes strides nordic walking is booming in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.02.2005 dutch prefer cannabis cafes to pharmacies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : expensive relief with legal cannabis readily available at cafes , the dutch government program for issuing medical marijuana through pharmacies is losing money . stocks of pot are piling up in dutch pharmacies as patients seeking medical marijuana eschew it for cheaper - and more pleasurable - relief available at cafes .
that is costing the dutch government hundreds of thousands of euros . even though marijuana is legal and widely available in hundreds of dutch cannabis cafes known as coffee shops , the dutch government set up a program for medical marijuana in september 2003 . the idea was that patients would prefer a prescription from a pharmacy with a guaranteed strength and quality rather than take their chances in the commercial coffee shops .
it did n't work out that way . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : celebrating three decades of progressive drug policies dutch minister of health hans hoogervorst reported last december that the program generated a loss of almost € 400,000 -lrb- $ 520,000 -rrb- in 2004 . of the estimated 10,000 to 15,000 patients who use cannabis for medical reasons , only between 1,000 and 1,500 have taken part in the medical cannabis program .
the health ministry scaled down its expected yearly sales from between 200 and 400 kilos of marijuana to just 70 kilos -lrb- 154 lbs -rrb- . " it appears that doctors are not prescribing as much as we had estimated based on studies , " said bas kuik , spokesman for the government regulated bureau of medical cannabis -lrb- bmc -rrb- . the government will not yet term the program a failure but said it is being re-evaluated and a decision on it would be made later this year . relief from marijuana studies have shown that marijuana can reduce nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiotherapy , alleviate tension in glaucoma patients and improve the appetites of people infected with hiv or suffering from aids . the dutch decriminalized the use of cannabis in the 1970s and currently allow the sale through authorized bars known as coffee shops .
sales are limited to five grams per person and growing marijuana is forbidden . comparative shopping most attribute the growing stockpiles to cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forbidden medicine - doctors weigh in on the debate " problem number one is the price , " said james burton , one of two officially-recognized growers of medical marijuana until this year when the government ended its contract with him .
" medical marijuana is sold at some € 9 a gram while in a normal coffee shop you can get a gram of cannabis at € 4.50 to € 5 .
there is a market out there , just not at this price . " the american has a long history with the drug .
as a glaucoma patient , he uses marijuana to ease tension .
he was jailed in the united states for growing the herb before he moved to the netherlands in 1991 . smoking more fun another problem for patients is that the dutch national health service does not reimburse prescriptions and only a few private health insurers do . at government prices , that means a prescription such as burton needs - 90 grams a month - costs over € 800 . this is simply too much for most patients . kuik insisted that the bmc does not make any money from medical marijuana and explained the mark-up was necessary because of tax , research , sterilization , packaging and logistics . he added that there is another possible reason for the unpopularity of medical marijuana . " the medical cannabis is made to be inhaled in a steam treatment or infused and drunk like tea and not for smoking , " he said .
" maybe that is a disappointment for people expecting to smoke it but of course the ministry of health can not encourage smoking .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .
rostock shocks schalke bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rostock player joakim persson and schalke player ebbe sand , left , fight for the ball during hansa rostock-fc schalke 04 match saturday just one point behind munich going into the game , second-placed schalke looked like it would have an easy time against last-placed hansa rostock , but in the end needed to call on last season 's golden boot winner ailton to bring just one point home from northern germany .
" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .
hanover 's uefa hopes dim hanover 96 played its fourth home game without a win saturday in its 1:3 loss to borussia dortmund , which has not lost in the season 's second half .
dortmund 's jan koller gave the guests an early lead in the sixth minute .
lars ricken scored the first of his two goals in the game .
hanover made it onto the scoreboard when nebojsa krupnikovic converted a penalty kick in the 72nd minute .
hamburg , however , kept its european dream alive in a 3:1 win in nuremberg .
japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .

6-9 , could help breath life into the industry , where hopes are high . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german ski racer alois vogl won at world cup slalom in jan .
in november and december turnover climbed , and werner haizmann , head of germany 's sports retail association , said he was optimistic . " the recent world cup victories by max rauffer and alois vogl will restore skiing 's upwards motion , " he said . no snow , no business but weak consumer spending in germany has little to do with the slump in winter sports goods sales . " the margins in ski production are relatively small , " said peter thürl from the sports retailers ' group .
" the price ceiling for a pair of skis is quickly reached as a winter vacation is generally very expensive .
then the buyer is n't prepared to shell out lots of money for a pair of skis as well . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snowy winters bring profits and unlike other industries , the sports goods sector is entirely dependent on the weather . " if it does n't snow enough before christmas , no one buys skis at all , " thürl said .
" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .
us company quicksilver has shown determined interest in leading french brand rossignol .
rumors have been circulating that salomon , also french , will shift ski production to romania .
and germany 's völkl may face a similar scenario .
california 's k2 sports , which now owns the company , plans to move ski production from straubing , in bavaria , to china . but former slalom world champion frank wörndl , who works for völkl , said production would n't leave straubing .
if the company remained the most innovative ski manufacturer , and continued offering sophisticated handcrafting , the bavarian town would keep its jobs , wörndl said .
besides , he added , " many buyers still value ' made in germany . " ' ina rottscheidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german fitness trend makes strides nordic walking is booming in germany .
but while outsiders may criticize " those people with the poles " as silly looking fadists , they may soon start to wonder : why are there so many of them ?

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .

all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .

japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .
it was robert vittek who took a little of the sting out of nuremberg 's loss by netting a goal for the home team in the 82nd minute .

stuttgart also was n't able to convert a half-time lead to three points and drew 1:1 at home against kaiserslautern .
bayern expected better bayern 's roy makaay converted a questionable penalty kick giving munich a 1:0 lead going into the locker room after jose guerrero half fell and was half pulled to the ground in the first half 's dying minutes .
bayer leverkusen can feel aggrieved by the spot-kick but in truth they were outclassed and must now wait another season to end their 16 year winless jinx in munich .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's roy makaay , 2nd right , scores with a penalty shot against leverkusen 's goalkeeper jörg butt , right , during the match between fc bayern munich and bayer 04 leverkusen in munich on saturday leverkusen was n't able to pick up its play in the match 's second half as bayern extended its lead to 2:0 , and its winning streak to nine games , with a goal from guerrero .
all leverkusen keeper jörg butt could do was shake his head when the ball bounced off guerrero 's thigh and back into the net .
" we played lively , but it was n't the great game i expected , " said bayern trainer felix magath , summing up the views of the 47,000 fans in the stadium .
only a handful of scoring chances and five yellow cards , for munich 's michael ballack and leverkusen 's robson ponte , juan silveira dos santos , carsten ramelow and jens nowtony , broke up what was otherwise a dull affair at the top of the bundesliga table .

" there was a little luck in it for us , " said ailton .
" the point was important to us . "
schalke 's ebbe sand opened scoring in the 25th minute , but the 20,000 fans in ostseestadio probably could n't believe their eyes when the home team went ahead in the second half after goals from rade prica and magnus arvidsson .
but rostock made too many mistakes against schalke and ailton punished them in the third minute of penalty time and kept his team from falling too far behind in the championship race .
bildunterschrift : stuttgart 's defense fails to block marco engelhardt 's free kick stuttgart also had to make themselves happy with a draw against kaiserslautern , although they enjoyed a 1:0 lead going into half time thanks to an early goal from german national team member kevin kuranyi .
even though they were playing a man down after lucien mettomo was sent off , an exceptional free kick from marco engelhardt in the 61st minute let the visitors take home a tie .
" we were leading 1:0 and had better numbers , it was our own fault , " said stuttgart captain zvonimir soldo of the tie .

japanese international naohiro takahara masterminded the victory with two goals and got some extra help from teammate benjamin lauth .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .

thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .

gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .

the loss was mainz 's sixth in a row .
berlin 's yildiray bastürk scored once in each half of the game and a goal from andreas neuendorf solidified berlin 's chances at international play by moving them three spots up to fourth place .
" it may sound like a paradox , but i am very satisfied with the game and my team , but not with the result , " said vfl bochum coach peter neururer of his team 's 1:1 draw against arminia bielefeld .
bochum needed the win to work its way out of the relegation zone and bielefeld could have used a win to make sure it does n't fall into it .
neither team is likely to be pleased with the compromise . it was ex-bochum player delron buckley who scored in the 29th minute to draw his new team level after peter madsen gave bielefeld the lead 10 minutes earlier .
werder bremen moves up paraguayan international nelson haedo valdez enhanced his supersub reputation scoring an 87th minute winner as german champions werder bremen came from two goals down to defeat vfl wolfsburg 3-2 on sunday .
valdez , 20 , had only been on the pitch 12 minutes after coming on as a substitute but his midas touch continued as bremen secured the spoils at the volkswagen arena . werder surge up to fourth with the victory and are now just one point behind vfb stuttgart who occupy third and the final champions league berth .
for wolfsburg it was another setback with the one-time leaders of the bundesliga tasting their tenth defeat of the campaign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfsburg 's pablo thiam , above , and bremen 's ludovic magnin fight for the ball during the vfl wolfsburg-werder bremen match wolfsburg were left kicking themselves as they somehow surrendered a two-goal cushion to finish empty-handed against bremen .
thomas brdaric , excluded from germany 's squad for wednesday 's friendly against argentina , netted after 26 minutes and when pablo thiam scored in the 49th minute the points looked destined for the home side . however , bremen showed all their resilience with two quick-fire goals through german international miroslav klose -lrb- 50 -rrb- and finn ludovic magnin -lrb- 59 -rrb- .
valdez then worked his magic scoring three minutes from time to devour wolves in front of their home fans .
incredibly wolfsburg have not drawn a match all season losing ten and winning ten . gladbach safe from relegation bildunterschrift : mönchengladbach 's jörg böhme -lrb- r -rrb- and freiburg 's levan tskitishvili fight for the ball in sunday 's other match borussia mönchengladbach edged away from the relegation zone with a 3-2 win over sc freiburg .
gladbach are eight points clear of third from bottom vfl bochum and dick advocaat 's team now appear safe .
gladbach also needed to come from behind with mali international soumaila coulibaly scored a contender for goal of the season to put freiburg ahead after 13 minutes .
coulibaly produced an unstoppable 35 meter shot that hit the underside of the crossbar to defeat american kasey keller in the gladbach goal .
the freak goal rallied gladbach into action and czech vaclav sverkos equalized on 25 minutes and belgian international wesley sonck then grabbed a brace -lrb- 30,49 -rrb- .

while puma expects it will continue on its upwards trajectory in 2005 and forecasts growth between 5 and 10 percent , those rates will be its slowest growth in seven years .
largely to blame , according to chief executive jochen zeitz , is lackluster demand in germany , france and britain .

" i think there 's a good-faith effort under way by our european allies to try to resolve this issue diplomatically .
we support that effort , " cheney said in an interview with fox news sunday . " the iranians , i think , should do the right thing , and they should , in fact , agree to transparency , reassure the outside world that they are not trying to acquire nuclear weapons , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : condoleezza rice in germany with chancellor gerhard schröder cheney ’ s words echo those of us secretary state condoleezza rice , who was in london and berlin last week to reassure european leaders that washington is behind the eu in continuing to pursue diplomatic solutions to the iran nuclear standoff .
military action against iran is “ not on the agenda at the moment , ” she said in response to concern on this side of the atlantic that the us may be preparing a show of force to coerce tehran into abandoning its nuclear program . room for negotiation ? the us , which has not always seen eye-to-eye with europe on the nuclear issue , is convinced iran is using its civilian nuclear program as a guise to develop atomic weapons .
referring to the islamic republic as one of the central forces in the “ axis of evil , ” cheney and us president george w. bush have made no secret of their impatience with tehran .
europe , however , has argued for continuing diplomatic measures . it seems the us may now be willing to wait out the negotiations . " -lrb- the iranians -rrb- know very well that we do not want them to acquire nuclear weapons , nor does the civilized world , " the vice president said .
" i ca n't think of anybody who 's eager to see the iranians develop that kind of capability . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaders from iran , germany , france and britain meet to discuss tehran 's nuclear program " now , we are moving to support efforts to resolve it diplomatically , " cheney said in a nod towards current efforts by britain , france and germany to offer iran trade and development assistance in return for suspending all uranium enrichment-related activities . leaving options open the iran-eu talks began in brussels in december , moved to geneva in january and are scheduled to resume tuesday in geneva , according to diplomats . " if this process breaks down , the next step probably is to go back to the board of governors of the international atomic energy agency and ultimately refer to the united nations security council for the imposition of international sanctions on iran . " there are a number of steps here to be considered .
we have not eliminated any alternative at this point , but we obviously are seriously pursuing diplomatic resolution of this problem , " cheney said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ktz -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says strike on iran a mistake a military strike against iran ’ s nuclear facilities would be a “ mistake , ” the european union ’ s foreign policy chief javier solana said and stressed the importance of continuing eu efforts at diplomatic engagement .

the wage freeze has been budgeted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's government to try and bring germany 's budget deficit below three percent of gross domestic product , as mandated by eu rules .
" a pay rise is absolutely not in the cards , " thomas boehle , the head of the vka association of local authorities , told bloomberg .
" the public coffers are empty . "
the government is forecasting economic growth of 1.6 percent this year , a rate that would keep the budget deficit to 2.9 percent of gdp , compared with 3.9 percent last year .
but government spending on the unemployed could be higher than anticipated since the jobless rolls surpassed the five million mark in january .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : snowy winters bring profits and unlike other industries , the sports goods sector is entirely dependent on the weather . " if it does n't snow enough before christmas , no one buys skis at all , " thürl said .
" then , for many people , renting is a better deal . " thus , the sports goods manufacturers have focused their energies on new innovations , technical falderal and accessories .
futuristic-looking aluminum skis with shock-absorbers , heated underwear , ski helmets with built-in music and special skis for women are just a few of the products exhibitors have been showing at " ispo 2005 . " and they 're trying to launch new trends that will attract people into the shops and onto the slopes with buzzwords like " back country , " " slope-style skiing " and " trail-running . " nordic relief bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nordic walkers winter sporting goods producers continue to benefit from the recent nordic walking trend , which thürl said was becoming a mass movement .
people above the age of 50 , who generally have deep pockets , have taken to the sport - which involves walking with the support of two poles - in droves . " above all , it appeals to unathletic types who just sat on their sofas until now , " haizmann said .
around 2 million germans are thought to have gotten into nordic walking . though only a few international firms are active in the ski sector , pressure on the smaller fish has been increasing .
us company quicksilver has shown determined interest in leading french brand rossignol .
rumors have been circulating that salomon , also french , will shift ski production to romania .
and germany 's völkl may face a similar scenario .
california 's k2 sports , which now owns the company , plans to move ski production from straubing , in bavaria , to china . but former slalom world champion frank wörndl , who works for völkl , said production would n't leave straubing .
if the company remained the most innovative ski manufacturer , and continued offering sophisticated handcrafting , the bavarian town would keep its jobs , wörndl said .
besides , he added , " many buyers still value ' made in germany . " ' ina rottscheidt -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german fitness trend makes strides nordic walking is booming in germany .

instead , he added that as a repeated victim of terrorism , saudi arabia is a first front against the war against terror . " terrorism does not belong to any particular religion or political system , " he said .
" our war against it is going to be long and difficult . " other saudi officials such as sheik saleh abdel-aziz al sheikh , minister for religious affairs , said that islam is not tolerant of terrorism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : saudi crown prince speaks at the conference " who injures or kills the innocent , who destroys property , these people show contempt for the basic principals of islam , " he said .

uk and swedish researchers found higher rates of digestive and lymphatic cancer among people who were big at birth .
bigger female babies went on to have significantly higher rates of breast cancer - but much lower rates of cancer of the womb lining .
details are published by the online edition of the international journal of cancer . "
in utero levels of some hormones may affect cancer risk " dr valerie mccormack the researchers , from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine and the universities of uppsala and stockholm examined the records of 11,166 babies born between 1915 and 1929 in sweden .
of these one in four was diagnosed with cancer between 1960 and 2001 .
the researchers found that each increase in birth weight of 450g was associated with a 17 % increase in lympathic cancers , and a 13 % increase in digestive cancers , including stomach , colorectal and pancreatic cancer .
women in the highest category of birth weight -lrb- 4kg or greater -rrb- were four times as likely to get breast cancer before age 50 , than those who weighed less than 3kg .
in contrast , women who were large at birth were only half as likely to get endometrial cancer as their smallest counterparts .
womb environment the researchers accept that some of their findings may have arisen by chance .
they also stress that birth weight only seems to be associated with an increased risk of certain cancers - and by no means all forms of the disease .
however , they speculate that the conditions inside the womb - for instance the levels of circulating hormones - may have a direct impact on the later chances of developing cancer .
researcher miss valerie mccormack told the bbc news website : " in utero levels of some hormones may affect cancer risk just as adult levels of growth hormones are correlated with risk .
previous studies have found associations between smaller birth size and increased risks of adult heart disease and diabetes .
professor john toy , medical director of cancer research uk , said : " this study 's findings are intriguing and , if totally correct , suggest that the susceptibility of developing certain types of cancers could be linked to the very early development of the cells of the body and its organs .
" the statistical analysis of the results are less robust than is usual and therefore there is room for doubt about the overall accuracy of the paper 's findings . "

uk and swedish researchers found higher rates of digestive and lymphatic cancer among people who were big at birth .
bigger female babies went on to have significantly higher rates of breast cancer - but much lower rates of cancer of the womb lining .
details are published by the online edition of the international journal of cancer .
in utero levels of some hormones may affect cancer risk dr valerie mccormack the researchers , from the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine and the universities of uppsala and stockholm examined the records of 11,166 babies born between 1915 and 1929 in sweden .
of these one in four was diagnosed with cancer between 1960 and 2001 .
the researchers found that each increase in birth weight of 450g was associated with a 17 % increase in lympathic cancers , and a 13 % increase in digestive cancers , including stomach , colorectal and pancreatic cancer .
women in the highest category of birth weight -lrb- 4kg or greater -rrb- were four times as likely to get breast cancer before age 50 , than those who weighed less than 3kg .
in contrast , women who were large at birth were only half as likely to get endometrial cancer as their smallest counterparts .
womb environment the researchers accept that some of their findings may have arisen by chance .
they also stress that birth weight only seems to be associated with an increased risk of certain cancers - and by no means all forms of the disease .
however , they speculate that the conditions inside the womb - for instance the levels of circulating hormones - may have a direct impact on the later chances of developing cancer .
researcher miss valerie mccormack told the bbc news website : " in utero levels of some hormones may affect cancer risk just as adult levels of growth hormones are correlated with risk .
previous studies have found associations between smaller birth size and increased risks of adult heart disease and diabetes .
professor john toy , medical director of cancer research uk , said : " this study 's findings are intriguing and , if totally correct , suggest that the susceptibility of developing certain types of cancers could be linked to the very early development of the cells of the body and its organs .
" the statistical analysis of the results are less robust than is usual and therefore there is room for doubt about the overall accuracy of the paper 's findings . "

the concert was held in meskal square , addis ababa , in honour of the reggae legend who died in 1981 .
marley 's five sons , widow and former backup singers were on the lineup along with top african acts angelique kidjo , baaba maal and youssou n 'dour .
it is the first time his birthday has been celebrated outside jamaica .
ethiopia , the spiritual home of rastafarianism , was chosen by marley 's family to host the official event , and is organised by the bob marley foundation , the un children 's agency , the african union and others .
free event many of those who gathered for the concert wore t-shirts emblazoned with portraits of marley or hand-bands and jewellery decorated with the ethiopian national flag and rastafarian colours of green , yellow and red .

marley , who was behind songs such as exodus and one love , won global stardom with his music and helped popularise the rastafarian religion , which venerates the late ethiopian emperor haile selassie .

his widow , rita , said : " it has always been the wish of bob marley to return to ethiopia and become a rastafarian ... and with the african union , addis ababa is the capital of africa and therefore a very symbolic place . "

one month on the damage is still clearly visible , from the increased number of contractors in town to the remnants of smelly sludge left behind by the receding water to the hundreds of deserted houses .
what these people are going through is very similar to bereavement the reverend john libby carlisle st james flood family suffers ' nightmare ' once the immediate emergency situation was under control , the recovery phase began .
the carlisle churches ' flood response estimated that they gave out 1,800 sausage and bacon butties , 200 sandwiches , 10,000 hot drinks and took 1,000 meals to home - figures that the reverend john libby described as " conservative " .
the group was formed by 40 carlisle churches , mustering 400 volunteers working shifts in 10 sites throughout the affected areas , so that " no resident was more than a couple of minutes walk from a hot drink , some food and a sympathetic ear " .
those serving refreshments were not just handy with a kettle but also had a basic qualification in support or counselling .
" what these people are going through is very similar to bereavement .
a lot of their memories were wiped out , " mr libby said .
" perversely people hold on to electrical goods .
when water is lapping at the door they do n't think about the photo albums . "
carlisle flood aftermath in pictures while it is estimated that it could be nine months before the residents are back in their houses , mr libby says it could be at least twice that long for the psychological recovery .
" experience has taught us that it could be 18 months later that people still have to be talked into going back , because there is a significant amount of trauma . "
he said one family he had spoken to had not been able to sleep since the flood .
" they told me it was like the titanic sinking .
all through the night they could hear noises , the occasional explosion , crashes , and bubbling .
" it was black and all they could hear was water . "
he said images of the boxing day tsunami in asia made them consider tunnelling through their roof to escape the water as they waited two days to be rescued .
" darkness and terror bring back the terror - and that terror is geographically rooted , " mr libby said .
even if the grants are not a lot , knowing that there is a sympathetic ear , just a little understanding and empathy , is helpful clare edwards cumbria community foundation the floods prompted many in the region and beyond to donate to appeals .
the cumbria flood recovery fund received £ 540,000 in the first month , and allocated £ 90,000 to 180 individuals and families , as well as £ 86,000 to community groups .
as well as large donations from such groups as the city and county councils , individuals were keen to show their support .
" it was very painful but worth it " when one man waxed his legs to raise £ 435 for the flood victims .
people in boscastle held a dance to raise money , having been through their own flash flood in august , while others saw similarities with the tsunami .
" i have recently sent money to the tsunami fund , but having seen the carlisle floods on tv , i firmly believe that charity begins at home , " said one donor .
already struggling pensioners have been generous : " it is only £ 10 , but as a pensioner it is all i can manage at this time .
i send it with my heartfelt sympathy for all who have suffered in this catastrophe . "
having helped cumbrians throughout the foot-and-mouth crisis of 2001 , both the churches and the cumbria community foundation , which set up the recovery fund , knew the importance of supporting those in need .
" even if the grants are not a lot , knowing that there is a sympathetic ear , just a little understanding and empathy is helpful , just to know that someone cares , " said clare edwards of the fund .

we were supposed to get married this year , but we 'll have to cancel that maree dixon carlisle resident communities helped as flood stress continues for the past 15 months , maree dixon , 34 , has been happy to rent a two-bedroom house for her fiancé and son in caldewgate , carlisle .
but now she just wants to leave the damp , smelly , cold and contaminated terrace house after flood water flowed through it on 7 january .
like many streets throughout the city , morton street is full of skips filled with the wet and ruined innards of its 20 or so houses .
while the whir of drying machines can be heard behind the locked doors of the deserted neighbouring houses , ms dixon continues to live in her house with william , 45 , and steven , 15 .
she sits on a settee donated by friends , her feet on a rug that when lifted off the stripped concrete floor reveals a dampness that will shortly produce a white mould lightly covering the pink mat .
a tidemark about 4ft high runs through the living room , kitchen and bathroom downstairs , showing where the water reached on 8 january .
the flood mark can be clearly seen throughout the house when the water started trickling in , the family 's desperate attempts to block up the back door were pointless - water was also coming in the front door and raw sewage was bubbling up from the toilet .
she warns against touching the still damp walls .
although her fiancé has washed out the house with a jet spray , she still fears residing bacteria from the dirty flood .
as the water rose , they tried to get as many belongings upstairs as possible , but lost their furniture , washing machine , cooker , fridge and all their food , as well as their car .
" the quicker we tried to move things , the quicker the water came in .
we 've lost things with sentimental value , such as photo albums , certificates , documents - things that you ca n't replace . "
a grant of £ 750 from the cumbria flood recovery fund has been used to purchase new items but it did not go far .
with no insurance , the family are reliant on friends and authorities but feel frustrated by what they regard as a lack of official help .
carlisle flood aftermath in pictures " we were supposed to get married this year but we 'll have to cancel that the way things are going .
all the money we had will have to go into this . "
ms dixon has stopped paying rent because of a dispute with her landlord over when the house will become habitable again .
she lost her housekeeping job about a fortnight after the flood .
morton st is deserted except for skips and builders she had initially been unable to contact her employers as telecommunications were cut and she was then too stressed coping with a damaged house to get to work .
her partner 's employer gave him a week off with pay to deal with the flood aftermath .
ms dixon is hoping her family will be rehoused , but one month on she has yet to move from morton street .
" this will always stay with us .
my son 's very quiet , he 's off school today and yesterday because he 's just not sleeping .

we were supposed to get married this year , but we 'll have to cancel that maree dixon carlisle resident communities helped as flood stress continues for the past 15 months , maree dixon , 34 , has been happy to rent a two-bedroom house for her fiancé and son in caldewgate , carlisle .
but now she just wants to leave the damp , smelly , cold and contaminated terrace house after flood water flowed through it on 7 january .
like many streets throughout the city , morton street is full of skips filled with the wet and ruined innards of its 20 or so houses .
while the whir of drying machines can be heard behind the locked doors of the deserted neighbouring houses , ms dixon continues to live in her house with william , 45 , and steven , 15 .
she sits on a settee donated by friends , her feet on a rug that when lifted off the stripped concrete floor reveals a dampness that will shortly produce a white mould lightly covering the pink mat .
a tidemark about 4ft high runs through the living room , kitchen and bathroom downstairs , showing where the water reached on 8 january .
the flood mark can be clearly seen throughout the house when the water started trickling in , the family 's desperate attempts to block up the back door were pointless - water was also coming in the front door and raw sewage was bubbling up from the toilet .
she warns against touching the still damp walls .
although her fiancé has washed out the house with a jet spray , she still fears residing bacteria from the dirty flood .
as the water rose , they tried to get as many belongings upstairs as possible , but lost their furniture , washing machine , cooker , fridge and all their food , as well as their car .
" the quicker we tried to move things , the quicker the water came in .
we 've lost things with sentimental value , such as photo albums , certificates , documents - things that you ca n't replace . "
a grant of £ 750 from the cumbria flood recovery fund has been used to purchase new items but it did not go far .
with no insurance , the family are reliant on friends and authorities but feel frustrated by what they regard as a lack of official help .
carlisle flood aftermath in pictures " we were supposed to get married this year but we 'll have to cancel that the way things are going .
all the money we had will have to go into this . "
ms dixon has stopped paying rent because of a dispute with her landlord over when the house will become habitable again .
she lost her housekeeping job about a fortnight after the flood .
morton st is deserted except for skips and builders she had initially been unable to contact her employers as telecommunications were cut and she was then too stressed coping with a damaged house to get to work .
her partner 's employer gave him a week off with pay to deal with the flood aftermath .
ms dixon is hoping her family will be rehoused , but one month on she has yet to move from morton street .

we were supposed to get married this year , but we 'll have to cancel that maree dixon carlisle resident communities helped as flood stress continues for the past 15 months , maree dixon , 34 , has been happy to rent a two-bedroom house for her fiancé and son in caldewgate , carlisle .
but now she just wants to leave the damp , smelly , cold and contaminated terrace house after flood water flowed through it on 7 january .
like many streets throughout the city , morton street is full of skips filled with the wet and ruined innards of its 20 or so houses .
while the whir of drying machines can be heard behind the locked doors of the deserted neighbouring houses , ms dixon continues to live in her house with william , 45 , and steven , 15 .
she sits on a settee donated by friends , her feet on a rug that when lifted off the stripped concrete floor reveals a dampness that will shortly produce a white mould lightly covering the pink mat .
a tidemark about 4ft high runs through the living room , kitchen and bathroom downstairs , showing where the water reached on 8 january .
the flood mark can be clearly seen throughout the house when the water started trickling in , the family 's desperate attempts to block up the back door were pointless - water was also coming in the front door and raw sewage was bubbling up from the toilet .
she warns against touching the still damp walls .
although her fiancé has washed out the house with a jet spray , she still fears residing bacteria from the dirty flood .
as the water rose , they tried to get as many belongings upstairs as possible , but lost their furniture , washing machine , cooker , fridge and all their food , as well as their car .
" the quicker we tried to move things , the quicker the water came in .
we 've lost things with sentimental value , such as photo albums , certificates , documents - things that you ca n't replace . "
a grant of £ 750 from the cumbria flood recovery fund has been used to purchase new items but it did not go far .
with no insurance , the family are reliant on friends and authorities but feel frustrated by what they regard as a lack of official help .
carlisle flood aftermath in pictures " we were supposed to get married this year but we 'll have to cancel that the way things are going .
all the money we had will have to go into this . "
ms dixon has stopped paying rent because of a dispute with her landlord over when the house will become habitable again .
she lost her housekeeping job about a fortnight after the flood .
morton st is deserted except for skips and builders she had initially been unable to contact her employers as telecommunications were cut and she was then too stressed coping with a damaged house to get to work .
her partner 's employer gave him a week off with pay to deal with the flood aftermath .
ms dixon is hoping her family will be rehoused , but one month on she has yet to move from morton street .

the research claims the number of drivers speeding regularly is up almost 10 % on a year ago .
it said that overall 57 % of drivers broke the motorway speed limit , and almost two-thirds exceed 30mph speed limits .
the figures came as another survey showed wales had one in eight of the uk 's mobile speed camera sites .
the 2005 rac report on motoring published on monday suggested current enforcement of speeding restrictions appeared to have little impact .
the most common reason given for speeding by those surveyed was the small chance of being caught .
the rac has termed this " driving under the radar " .
rac spokesman philip hale said : " in wales we have something of a speeding epidemic on our hands .
" more motorists than ever are admitting to disorder on the roads .
overall , 16 % , or four million british drivers , do not consider themselves law-abiding , almost double last year 's figure .
" enough people to fill 10 commercial holiday jets die every year on britain 's roads .
" individual motorists know these risks , yet choose to ignore them - drivers are speeding undeterred on all types of road , at all times of day , every day of the week and would only respond to the harshest penalties . "
mandatory re-training the rac said better detection , penalties and education were necessary to cut the number of speeding drivers .
it recommended the introduction of graduated speeding penalties so that worst offenders would receive the harshest punishments , as well as mandatory driver re-training and education after a speeding ban .
meanwhile , the number of mobile road safety camera sites in operation in the uk rose by 34.5 % during 2004 , according to cyclops , a company which manufactures detectors warning drivers about camera locations .
it said wales had 12.6 % of the sites , or one in eight .
the largest concentration of mobile sites , those patrolled by radar or laser operated speed cameras , were in south-east england , with 17.6 % of the uk total .
the lowest numbers were in scotland , with 8.7 % .

its survey reveals half of gps fail to make early diagnosis and many sufferers are not treated by a specialist .
emma healy from the association says in many cases it is down to a lack of gp training in this specialist field .
" doctors should be looking for other signs like personal trauma rather than just a problem with food . "
the association wants to end the lottery of treatment by increasing awareness and encouraging more study of the background to the condition .
low esteem " young people with eating disorders may have low self-esteem or have undergone a trigger cause like the death of a close relation or bullying at school , " said ms healy .
" these mixed together and an eating disorder can be one of the results .
people with concerns about their children should also be taken more seriously .
" on our helplines we 're still hearing about too many people going to the doctor and being told it 's just a phase and they 'll grow out of it .
" we know that the earlier you treat an eating disorder the quicker it is to a full recovery . "

his election as an mep in the east midlands took the silver-haired 61-year-old back to the career he left to become a household name .
born in birmingham , mr kilroy-silk was educated at the london school of economics .
he worked as a university lecturer before becoming a labour mp .
he represented ormskirk in lancashire from 1974 and was involved a long-running dispute with supporters of the hard left militant tendency .
he later switched seats opting for the safe labour constituency of knowsley north following the 1983 boundary review , serving on labour 's frontbench as a home affairs spokesman .
three years later he quit to host the bbc 's kilroy show .
arab comments mr kilroy-silk insisted he had no regrets about abandoning the serious work of westminster politics .
he once said the bbc expected him to do newsnight or question time , but that he found kilroy " more interesting and it paid more " .
it was a career that saw him brush with controversy on more than one occasion , most famously in his sunday express column describing arabs as " suicide bombers , limb-amputators , women repressors " . "
i do n't do humble " robert kilroy-silk while he insisted he had a right to express his views and claimed to have widespread public support , the comments saw his show axed and him leave the bbc .
the row was not the first time the tv host had been accused of racism or xenophobia .
he had attracted criticism for comments about asylum seekers and irish people .
' victim entertainment ' the presenter 's show also fell foul of tv watchdogs - in 1998 it was rapped by the british standards commission for a scene in which a guest exposed himself on live tv .
the bbc said the programme team had been " taken by surprise " by the incident , which prompted five complaints from viewers .
nevertheless the corporation apologised to the bsc over the incident .
in another run-in with the bsc , mr kilroy-silk said the bsc 's £ 2m budget would be better spent on the nhs .
this time , he was responding to criticism of the kilroy show , which the bsc had branded " victim entertainment " .
the presenter , who hosted the show for 17 years , said the organisation 's budget could be spent on " 630 hip operations or 345 heart bypass operations " .
he denounced the bsc 's attitude as " patronising " to his guests .
further ambitions married with two children , mr kilroy-silk 's return to the political fray again shows he has no desire for a quiet life .
he even declared : " i do n't do humble . "
he said more or less from the outset that he would consider taking over the ukip leadership .
for months he walked a tightrope - believing he was the party 's greatest asset he openly campaigned to oust roger knapman while warning that ukip would " self-destruct " if it expelled him .
in the end he quit before he was pushed and then a few days later founded his own party called veritas , which is latin for truth .
he announced he was to fight the derbyshire seat of erewash in the general election expected in 2005 .

born in birmingham , mr kilroy-silk was educated at the london school of economics .
he worked as a university lecturer before becoming a labour mp .
he represented ormskirk in lancashire from 1974 and was involved a long-running dispute with supporters of the hard left militant tendency .
