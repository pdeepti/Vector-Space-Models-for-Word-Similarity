on the other side is denmark , his homeland of 50 years .
but it is there that he , with his wife jane , is n't permitted to live .
and the relationship had begun so promisingly . " we married in 2002 , " he said .
" jane has a sister who has lived in denmark since 1991 and came to visit .
we met and it was love at first sight . " after marrying , they applied for residency for 25-year-old jane at a local police station . " they questioned us separately , " she recalled .
" they were trying to be nice but in reality , they reported that my husband had only married me to get me into the country . " jane is 21 years younger than her husband - too big an age difference , the immigration authorities decided .
it just could n't be love .
so they declared the marriage " fictitious " and told jane to leave the country .
she did and he followed her , to the philippines , then sweden and finally , a year ago , to flensburg . " it is friendly here and we feel free , " he said .
" that is why we will remain .
we do n't want to relive that again . " many examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik and his wife crown princess mary had no problems getting married , even though mary is australian .
about 3,000 danes marry foreigners every year and many of them leave the country , usually to live in sweden or germany .
if they marry a non-eu national , they can only live in denmark under certain conditions .
for example , the foreign spouse must be at least 24 years old .
and in each case , immigration officials have the sole right to decide whether it is a valid marriage . this practice does not correspond with eu laws , said elsebeth gerner nielsen , a representative of the opposition social liberals in the danish parliament . " we in denmark have unfortunately not consulted eu law , " she said .
" we still have old danish rules here . " reducing immigration denmark has a special status in the eu .
that is how the conservative ruling party was able to strengthen the immigration rules in 2002 .
about 7 percent of the population in denmark is foreign .
" we want to reduce immigration in order to improve integration of immigrants already here , " said immigration minister rikke hvilshoey .
" through the new law , the children of immigrants have a better chance in the workplace . " but nielsen believes the law will only make things worse . " the concerns over immigration are in western denmark where there are hardly any immigrants , " she said .
" in copenhagen , where most foreigners live , people say they have no problems with it . " but the social liberal party stands alone in their views .
even the social democrats backed the conservatives in the plan . so thousands more international couples will continue to follow the footsteps of steen and jane back hansen - to live out their married lives beyond denmark 's borders . jens wellhörner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where gay marriage is just marriage as the gay marriage debate continues in the u.s. and canada , many european countries are looking on bemusedly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.05.2005 danish immigration policies hinder love großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : danes and their foreign spouses find it easier to love in other countries they may have hearts on their currency but these days , some danes and their foreign spouses are calling increasingly tougher danish immigration policies heartless and moving to neighboring countries . steen back hansen looks out at the flensburg fjord in germany .
on the other side is denmark , his homeland of 50 years .
but it is there that he , with his wife jane , is n't permitted to live .
and the relationship had begun so promisingly . " we married in 2002 , " he said .
" jane has a sister who has lived in denmark since 1991 and came to visit .
we met and it was love at first sight . " after marrying , they applied for residency for 25-year-old jane at a local police station . " they questioned us separately , " she recalled .
" they were trying to be nice but in reality , they reported that my husband had only married me to get me into the country . " jane is 21 years younger than her husband - too big an age difference , the immigration authorities decided .
it just could n't be love .
so they declared the marriage " fictitious " and told jane to leave the country .
she did and he followed her , to the philippines , then sweden and finally , a year ago , to flensburg . " it is friendly here and we feel free , " he said .
" that is why we will remain .
we do n't want to relive that again . " many examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik and his wife crown princess mary had no problems getting married , even though mary is australian .
about 3,000 danes marry foreigners every year and many of them leave the country , usually to live in sweden or germany .
if they marry a non-eu national , they can only live in denmark under certain conditions .
for example , the foreign spouse must be at least 24 years old .
and in each case , immigration officials have the sole right to decide whether it is a valid marriage . this practice does not correspond with eu laws , said elsebeth gerner nielsen , a representative of the opposition social liberals in the danish parliament . " we in denmark have unfortunately not consulted eu law , " she said .
" we still have old danish rules here . " reducing immigration denmark has a special status in the eu .
that is how the conservative ruling party was able to strengthen the immigration rules in 2002 .
about 7 percent of the population in denmark is foreign .
" we want to reduce immigration in order to improve integration of immigrants already here , " said immigration minister rikke hvilshoey .
" through the new law , the children of immigrants have a better chance in the workplace . " but nielsen believes the law will only make things worse . " the concerns over immigration are in western denmark where there are hardly any immigrants , " she said .
" in copenhagen , where most foreigners live , people say they have no problems with it . " but the social liberal party stands alone in their views .
even the social democrats backed the conservatives in the plan . so thousands more international couples will continue to follow the footsteps of steen and jane back hansen - to live out their married lives beyond denmark 's borders . jens wellhörner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where gay marriage is just marriage as the gay marriage debate continues in the u.s. and canada , many european countries are looking on bemusedly .
the continent has been pioneering the drive to grant gays the same rights as herterosexual couples .

they point to a new study which claims that about 30 percent of the staff in postwar west german ministries had been members of hitler 's nazi party .
a law passed in 1951 allowed former nazi party members to be re-employed by the newly-established west german state .
but historians such as hans-ullrich wehler now say the first postwar german government interpreted the new freedoms in an exceptional way . " at the beginning of the 1950s a strong debate emerged after it became known that there were more nazi party members in government administration than at the peak of hitler 's power in 1938 , " he said .
" without any doubt there was a continuation of staff policy at the non-political level in german ministries . "
a fresh start ? the new findings published by historian norbert frei indicate that in the interior ministry more than 40 percent of the staff in the 1950s may have had a nazi past .
interior minister schily , however , sees no reason to investigate the influence of nazi ideology on german interior policy at the time .
in a recent cabinet meeting he refused to introduce such efforts undertaken by other ministers . " i see no reason to set up an independent history commission , " schily said .
" this would create the impression that there is such a thing as a continuation in staff policy , which i strongly believe is actually non-existent . " in a high-profile case , foreign minister joschka fischer set up such a commission recently after it had become known that the german foreign office readily employed nazis after the war .
they included former nazi prosecutor franz nüsslein , who signed death warrants in german-occupied czechoslovakia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and renate künast consumer protection and agriculture minister renate künast has also started a probe to find out how many nazis were taken on by her ministry in the 1950s .
meanwhile , schily 's refusal to join his colleagues in this effort has caused strong criticism from opposition politicians such as jürgen fissinger from the liberal fdp .
slipped through de-nazification ? " quite obviously interior minister otto schily is seeking to end the debate about germany 's nazi past once and for all , " he said .
" this is in stark contrast to the laudable attempts of joschka fischer and renate künast and is an attitude that should n't be allowed to go through . " historians believe that the interior ministry , in particular , could have a number of skeletons in the closet .
setting up postwar german security agencies , including police and intelligence services , might not have been possible without the participation of former nazis , they say .
in the worst case , members of the gestapo secret service who had escaped postwar de-nazification may have been among them . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer fires dissenting diplomat attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter .

they point to a new study which claims that about 30 percent of the staff in postwar west german ministries had been members of hitler 's nazi party .
a law passed in 1951 allowed former nazi party members to be re-employed by the newly-established west german state .
but historians such as hans-ullrich wehler now say the first postwar german government interpreted the new freedoms in an exceptional way . " at the beginning of the 1950s a strong debate emerged after it became known that there were more nazi party members in government administration than at the peak of hitler 's power in 1938 , " he said .
" without any doubt there was a continuation of staff policy at the non-political level in german ministries . "
a fresh start ? the new findings published by historian norbert frei indicate that in the interior ministry more than 40 percent of the staff in the 1950s may have had a nazi past .
interior minister schily , however , sees no reason to investigate the influence of nazi ideology on german interior policy at the time .
in a recent cabinet meeting he refused to introduce such efforts undertaken by other ministers . " i see no reason to set up an independent history commission , " schily said .
" this would create the impression that there is such a thing as a continuation in staff policy , which i strongly believe is actually non-existent . " in a high-profile case , foreign minister joschka fischer set up such a commission recently after it had become known that the german foreign office readily employed nazis after the war .
they included former nazi prosecutor franz nüsslein , who signed death warrants in german-occupied czechoslovakia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and renate künast consumer protection and agriculture minister renate künast has also started a probe to find out how many nazis were taken on by her ministry in the 1950s .
meanwhile , schily 's refusal to join his colleagues in this effort has caused strong criticism from opposition politicians such as jürgen fissinger from the liberal fdp .
slipped through de-nazification ? " quite obviously interior minister otto schily is seeking to end the debate about germany 's nazi past once and for all , " he said .
" this is in stark contrast to the laudable attempts of joschka fischer and renate künast and is an attitude that should n't be allowed to go through . " historians believe that the interior ministry , in particular , could have a number of skeletons in the closet .
setting up postwar german security agencies , including police and intelligence services , might not have been possible without the participation of former nazis , they say .
in the worst case , members of the gestapo secret service who had escaped postwar de-nazification may have been among them . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer fires dissenting diplomat attempts to avoid embarrassing tributes to diplomats who served under the nazis have led to the removal of one long-time diplomat critical of the foreign minister 's handling of the matter .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.05.2005 life beyond frankfurters ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer , top dog among germany 's sassy , young tv chefs young , " hip " tv cooks including and modeled on britain 's jamie oliver have developed a significant audience in germany .
it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .
people find that in the star cook and in the new organic supermarkets . "
centuries of bad food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi but it seems incongruous that in a country where discount supermarkets are experiencing an unprecedented boom , germans would spend their money on the high quality ingredients that the tv chefs stress .
and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that . '
it 's still applicable today , " siebeck said . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

on the other side is denmark , his homeland of 50 years .
but it is there that he , with his wife jane , is n't permitted to live .
and the relationship had begun so promisingly . " we married in 2002 , " he said .
" jane has a sister who has lived in denmark since 1991 and came to visit .
we met and it was love at first sight . " after marrying , they applied for residency for 25-year-old jane at a local police station . " they questioned us separately , " she recalled .
" they were trying to be nice but in reality , they reported that my husband had only married me to get me into the country . " jane is 21 years younger than her husband - too big an age difference , the immigration authorities decided .
it just could n't be love .
so they declared the marriage " fictitious " and told jane to leave the country .
she did and he followed her , to the philippines , then sweden and finally , a year ago , to flensburg . " it is friendly here and we feel free , " he said .
" that is why we will remain .
we do n't want to relive that again . " many examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik and his wife crown princess mary had no problems getting married , even though mary is australian .
about 3,000 danes marry foreigners every year and many of them leave the country , usually to live in sweden or germany .
if they marry a non-eu national , they can only live in denmark under certain conditions .
for example , the foreign spouse must be at least 24 years old .
and in each case , immigration officials have the sole right to decide whether it is a valid marriage . this practice does not correspond with eu laws , said elsebeth gerner nielsen , a representative of the opposition social liberals in the danish parliament . " we in denmark have unfortunately not consulted eu law , " she said .
" we still have old danish rules here . " reducing immigration denmark has a special status in the eu .
that is how the conservative ruling party was able to strengthen the immigration rules in 2002 .
about 7 percent of the population in denmark is foreign .
" we want to reduce immigration in order to improve integration of immigrants already here , " said immigration minister rikke hvilshoey .
" through the new law , the children of immigrants have a better chance in the workplace . " but nielsen believes the law will only make things worse . " the concerns over immigration are in western denmark where there are hardly any immigrants , " she said .
" in copenhagen , where most foreigners live , people say they have no problems with it . " but the social liberal party stands alone in their views .
even the social democrats backed the conservatives in the plan . so thousands more international couples will continue to follow the footsteps of steen and jane back hansen - to live out their married lives beyond denmark 's borders . jens wellhörner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where gay marriage is just marriage as the gay marriage debate continues in the u.s. and canada , many european countries are looking on bemusedly .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .
gustavo aristegui is a spokesperson for spain 's main opposition party , the conservative popular party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom and democracy after four decades " our transition from dictatorship to democracy is an example in europe and i think that we 've got to cherish this and not re-open wounds that have healed , " he said .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .

it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .

and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that .

the 56-year-old organization will adopt three conventions on preventing and financing terrorism and human trafficking during the gathering . other issues on the agenda include the protection of minorities , free movement of europeans across the continent and violence against children .
the council 's future goals will be defined in a new political mandate meant to ensure that its activities remain relevant to the 800 million people who live in its 46 member states . " i 'm hoping the summit agrees to put more emphasis on democracy as it is clear from many countries , ukraine and georgia are two , that people want more democracy , " the council 's secretary general , terry davis , told reuters news agency . " we 're looking to expand to central asia and develop relations .
it might well be that at some point in the future the heads of states would like the council 's boundaries to be expanded , " davis said , adding that expansion was not on the warsaw summit 's agenda . talking shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe the council of europe is often regarded as the conscience of europe .
formed at the end of world war ii , since 1989 it has acted as a human rights watchdog for europe 's fledgling post-communist democracies , alerting the international community to suspected abuses . human rights groups , though , expressed concern that the warsaw summit will just be a talking shop , producing little in the way of concrete results .

it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .

germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .
people find that in the star cook and in the new organic supermarkets . "
centuries of bad food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi but it seems incongruous that in a country where discount supermarkets are experiencing an unprecedented boom , germans would spend their money on the high quality ingredients that the tv chefs stress .
and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .
his lawyer , robert amsterdam , said his client 's arrest and trial was the culmination of a vicious campaign by putin to eliminate political opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin allegedly saw in khodorkosvky a potential political opponent outside of the courtroom in moscow , supporters and opponents gathered in anticipation of the verdict .
khodorkovsky lawyer sanford saunders was pessimistic upon entering the court room monday morning . " mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev will be convicted today … and the verdict will not represent the evidence , " saunders told television cameras .
west skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the moscow courtoom , with photos of khodorkovsky in the background in his closing statements , khodorkovsky has said the trial " was contrived " by the kremlin " with the aim of taking for themselves the most profitable oil company in russia . " russian officials on april 27 postponed the verdict on the trial , which wrapped up on april 11 .
opponents said putin was trying to avoid tough questions as he welcomed world leaders , including president george w. bush , to moscow to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii on may 9 .
the western world has kept a close eye on the trial .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a visit to moscow in april that " people are really watching -lrb- the trial -rrb- for signals that indeed there is rule of law in russia . " germany market-oriented germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder seems less perturbed by the case .
the chancellor , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it was n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a close relationship with the russian president german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verdict in yukos trial postponed the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .

these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .

no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.05.2005 spain deals with its fascist past back to first page back 2/2 not a personal monument but there 's no doubt that millions of spaniards do regard a reexamination of the past as very important . exhibitions and television programs about what happened during the civil war and the franco years attract enormous public attention here .
on the streets of madrid , most people think it is about time the valley of the fallen was changed . " i think it 's alright to change it because there is no museum of the civil war for instance , there is no nothing at all for that , " said one pedestrian named javier .
" so i think that they want to forget it and the people want to remember so not to happen again . i hope there will be a debate for it . "
but that 's not a view shared by the franco foundation - a privately funded group dedicated to preserving the history of the franco years . their office is like a snapshot from the fascist past - dimly lit rooms , eagle-headed flags hanging from the walls , franco busts and photos everywhere . there are even old maps rolled up on tables as though the generalissimo himself is about to enter and plan his next move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some revere him still " i do n't believe it is a monument to franco , it 's not a personal monument to anyone , " said felipe moralez , deputy director of the franco foundation .
" but the bodies of soldiers from both sides in the war of 1936 are buried there . it 's neither a monument to franco or -lrb- fascism -rrb- . " but to some , a place of homage it 's an argument that does have validity : thousands of bodies , both nationalist and republican are buried in the monument . when this colossal structure was finished in 1959 , franco did dedicate it to national reconciliation . but there 's still no information telling visitors that republican prisoners of war - thirty thousand of them - actually built it .
and the monument certainly has n't reconciled many spaniards .
emilo silva calls it franco 's version of an egyptian pyramid , built by him to glorify his memory .
many refuse to visit it for that reason .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.05.2005 spain deals with its fascist past back to first page back 2/2 not a personal monument but there 's no doubt that millions of spaniards do regard a reexamination of the past as very important . exhibitions and television programs about what happened during the civil war and the franco years attract enormous public attention here .
on the streets of madrid , most people think it is about time the valley of the fallen was changed . " i think it 's alright to change it because there is no museum of the civil war for instance , there is no nothing at all for that , " said one pedestrian named javier .
" so i think that they want to forget it and the people want to remember so not to happen again . i hope there will be a debate for it . "
but that 's not a view shared by the franco foundation - a privately funded group dedicated to preserving the history of the franco years . their office is like a snapshot from the fascist past - dimly lit rooms , eagle-headed flags hanging from the walls , franco busts and photos everywhere . there are even old maps rolled up on tables as though the generalissimo himself is about to enter and plan his next move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some revere him still " i do n't believe it is a monument to franco , it 's not a personal monument to anyone , " said felipe moralez , deputy director of the franco foundation .
" but the bodies of soldiers from both sides in the war of 1936 are buried there . it 's neither a monument to franco or -lrb- fascism -rrb- . " but to some , a place of homage it 's an argument that does have validity : thousands of bodies , both nationalist and republican are buried in the monument . when this colossal structure was finished in 1959 , franco did dedicate it to national reconciliation . but there 's still no information telling visitors that republican prisoners of war - thirty thousand of them - actually built it .
and the monument certainly has n't reconciled many spaniards .
emilo silva calls it franco 's version of an egyptian pyramid , built by him to glorify his memory .
many refuse to visit it for that reason .
but for a small number of others , it is a place of homage .
the falange , still a legal political party in spain , gather each year in the valley of the fallen to mark franco 's death and think changing the monument is like trying to rewrite the past . " we think that it 's very dangerous for our history to eliminate only one part of spain 's history , " said fernando canda la piedra , head of the falange party .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

they point to a new study which claims that about 30 percent of the staff in postwar west german ministries had been members of hitler 's nazi party .
a law passed in 1951 allowed former nazi party members to be re-employed by the newly-established west german state .
but historians such as hans-ullrich wehler now say the first postwar german government interpreted the new freedoms in an exceptional way . " at the beginning of the 1950s a strong debate emerged after it became known that there were more nazi party members in government administration than at the peak of hitler 's power in 1938 , " he said .
" without any doubt there was a continuation of staff policy at the non-political level in german ministries . "
a fresh start ? the new findings published by historian norbert frei indicate that in the interior ministry more than 40 percent of the staff in the 1950s may have had a nazi past .
interior minister schily , however , sees no reason to investigate the influence of nazi ideology on german interior policy at the time .
in a recent cabinet meeting he refused to introduce such efforts undertaken by other ministers . " i see no reason to set up an independent history commission , " schily said .
" this would create the impression that there is such a thing as a continuation in staff policy , which i strongly believe is actually non-existent . " in a high-profile case , foreign minister joschka fischer set up such a commission recently after it had become known that the german foreign office readily employed nazis after the war .
they included former nazi prosecutor franz nüsslein , who signed death warrants in german-occupied czechoslovakia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer and renate künast consumer protection and agriculture minister renate künast has also started a probe to find out how many nazis were taken on by her ministry in the 1950s .
meanwhile , schily 's refusal to join his colleagues in this effort has caused strong criticism from opposition politicians such as jürgen fissinger from the liberal fdp .
slipped through de-nazification ? " quite obviously interior minister otto schily is seeking to end the debate about germany 's nazi past once and for all , " he said .
" this is in stark contrast to the laudable attempts of joschka fischer and renate künast and is an attitude that should n't be allowed to go through . " historians believe that the interior ministry , in particular , could have a number of skeletons in the closet .

on the streets of madrid , most people think it is about time the valley of the fallen was changed . " i think it 's alright to change it because there is no museum of the civil war for instance , there is no nothing at all for that , " said one pedestrian named javier .
" so i think that they want to forget it and the people want to remember so not to happen again . i hope there will be a debate for it . "
but that 's not a view shared by the franco foundation - a privately funded group dedicated to preserving the history of the franco years . their office is like a snapshot from the fascist past - dimly lit rooms , eagle-headed flags hanging from the walls , franco busts and photos everywhere . there are even old maps rolled up on tables as though the generalissimo himself is about to enter and plan his next move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some revere him still " i do n't believe it is a monument to franco , it 's not a personal monument to anyone , " said felipe moralez , deputy director of the franco foundation .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

the 56-year-old organization will adopt three conventions on preventing and financing terrorism and human trafficking during the gathering . other issues on the agenda include the protection of minorities , free movement of europeans across the continent and violence against children .
the council 's future goals will be defined in a new political mandate meant to ensure that its activities remain relevant to the 800 million people who live in its 46 member states . " i 'm hoping the summit agrees to put more emphasis on democracy as it is clear from many countries , ukraine and georgia are two , that people want more democracy , " the council 's secretary general , terry davis , told reuters news agency . " we 're looking to expand to central asia and develop relations .
it might well be that at some point in the future the heads of states would like the council 's boundaries to be expanded , " davis said , adding that expansion was not on the warsaw summit 's agenda . talking shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe the council of europe is often regarded as the conscience of europe .
formed at the end of world war ii , since 1989 it has acted as a human rights watchdog for europe 's fledgling post-communist democracies , alerting the international community to suspected abuses . human rights groups , though , expressed concern that the warsaw summit will just be a talking shop , producing little in the way of concrete results .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.05.2005 spain deals with its fascist past back to first page back 2/2 not a personal monument but there 's no doubt that millions of spaniards do regard a reexamination of the past as very important . exhibitions and television programs about what happened during the civil war and the franco years attract enormous public attention here .
on the streets of madrid , most people think it is about time the valley of the fallen was changed . " i think it 's alright to change it because there is no museum of the civil war for instance , there is no nothing at all for that , " said one pedestrian named javier .
" so i think that they want to forget it and the people want to remember so not to happen again . i hope there will be a debate for it . "
but that 's not a view shared by the franco foundation - a privately funded group dedicated to preserving the history of the franco years . their office is like a snapshot from the fascist past - dimly lit rooms , eagle-headed flags hanging from the walls , franco busts and photos everywhere . there are even old maps rolled up on tables as though the generalissimo himself is about to enter and plan his next move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some revere him still " i do n't believe it is a monument to franco , it 's not a personal monument to anyone , " said felipe moralez , deputy director of the franco foundation .
" but the bodies of soldiers from both sides in the war of 1936 are buried there . it 's neither a monument to franco or -lrb- fascism -rrb- . " but to some , a place of homage it 's an argument that does have validity : thousands of bodies , both nationalist and republican are buried in the monument . when this colossal structure was finished in 1959 , franco did dedicate it to national reconciliation . but there 's still no information telling visitors that republican prisoners of war - thirty thousand of them - actually built it .
and the monument certainly has n't reconciled many spaniards .
emilo silva calls it franco 's version of an egyptian pyramid , built by him to glorify his memory .
many refuse to visit it for that reason .
but for a small number of others , it is a place of homage .
the falange , still a legal political party in spain , gather each year in the valley of the fallen to mark franco 's death and think changing the monument is like trying to rewrite the past . " we think that it 's very dangerous for our history to eliminate only one part of spain 's history , " said fernando canda la piedra , head of the falange party .
" i think it should stay like it is now because no one can say what is good and what is bad history . "
but if the falange is still living in the past , spanish society has moved on .
even most of those on the right of the political spectrum think it 's important to provide accurate historical information on the site , and in a manner that is respectful to both sides .
in many ways , many say this is a battle for control of spain 's history . but it 's certain that franco 's valley of the fallen will be changed and with those changes spain is making an important gesture towards the past and its future . danny wood -lrb- jb -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain says resounding yes to eu constitution spaniards gave a strong seal of approval to the new european constitution in a sunday referendum , with four in five of those casting ballots backing the text , exit polls showed .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .

on the streets of madrid , most people think it is about time the valley of the fallen was changed . " i think it 's alright to change it because there is no museum of the civil war for instance , there is no nothing at all for that , " said one pedestrian named javier .
" so i think that they want to forget it and the people want to remember so not to happen again . i hope there will be a debate for it . "
but that 's not a view shared by the franco foundation - a privately funded group dedicated to preserving the history of the franco years . their office is like a snapshot from the fascist past - dimly lit rooms , eagle-headed flags hanging from the walls , franco busts and photos everywhere . there are even old maps rolled up on tables as though the generalissimo himself is about to enter and plan his next move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some revere him still " i do n't believe it is a monument to franco , it 's not a personal monument to anyone , " said felipe moralez , deputy director of the franco foundation .
" but the bodies of soldiers from both sides in the war of 1936 are buried there . it 's neither a monument to franco or -lrb- fascism -rrb- . " but to some , a place of homage it 's an argument that does have validity : thousands of bodies , both nationalist and republican are buried in the monument . when this colossal structure was finished in 1959 , franco did dedicate it to national reconciliation . but there 's still no information telling visitors that republican prisoners of war - thirty thousand of them - actually built it .
and the monument certainly has n't reconciled many spaniards .
emilo silva calls it franco 's version of an egyptian pyramid , built by him to glorify his memory .
many refuse to visit it for that reason .
but for a small number of others , it is a place of homage .
the falange , still a legal political party in spain , gather each year in the valley of the fallen to mark franco 's death and think changing the monument is like trying to rewrite the past . " we think that it 's very dangerous for our history to eliminate only one part of spain 's history , " said fernando canda la piedra , head of the falange party .
" i think it should stay like it is now because no one can say what is good and what is bad history . "
but if the falange is still living in the past , spanish society has moved on .
even most of those on the right of the political spectrum think it 's important to provide accurate historical information on the site , and in a manner that is respectful to both sides .
in many ways , many say this is a battle for control of spain 's history . but it 's certain that franco 's valley of the fallen will be changed and with those changes spain is making an important gesture towards the past and its future . danny wood -lrb- jb -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain says resounding yes to eu constitution spaniards gave a strong seal of approval to the new european constitution in a sunday referendum , with four in five of those casting ballots backing the text , exit polls showed .

" but to some , a place of homage it 's an argument that does have validity : thousands of bodies , both nationalist and republican are buried in the monument . when this colossal structure was finished in 1959 , franco did dedicate it to national reconciliation . but there 's still no information telling visitors that republican prisoners of war - thirty thousand of them - actually built it .
and the monument certainly has n't reconciled many spaniards .
emilo silva calls it franco 's version of an egyptian pyramid , built by him to glorify his memory .
many refuse to visit it for that reason .
but for a small number of others , it is a place of homage .
the falange , still a legal political party in spain , gather each year in the valley of the fallen to mark franco 's death and think changing the monument is like trying to rewrite the past . " we think that it 's very dangerous for our history to eliminate only one part of spain 's history , " said fernando canda la piedra , head of the falange party .
" i think it should stay like it is now because no one can say what is good and what is bad history . "
but if the falange is still living in the past , spanish society has moved on .
even most of those on the right of the political spectrum think it 's important to provide accurate historical information on the site , and in a manner that is respectful to both sides .
in many ways , many say this is a battle for control of spain 's history . but it 's certain that franco 's valley of the fallen will be changed and with those changes spain is making an important gesture towards the past and its future . danny wood -lrb- jb -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain says resounding yes to eu constitution spaniards gave a strong seal of approval to the new european constitution in a sunday referendum , with four in five of those casting ballots backing the text , exit polls showed .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .

on the other side is denmark , his homeland of 50 years .
but it is there that he , with his wife jane , is n't permitted to live .
and the relationship had begun so promisingly . " we married in 2002 , " he said .
" jane has a sister who has lived in denmark since 1991 and came to visit .
we met and it was love at first sight . " after marrying , they applied for residency for 25-year-old jane at a local police station . " they questioned us separately , " she recalled .
" they were trying to be nice but in reality , they reported that my husband had only married me to get me into the country . " jane is 21 years younger than her husband - too big an age difference , the immigration authorities decided .
it just could n't be love .
so they declared the marriage " fictitious " and told jane to leave the country .
she did and he followed her , to the philippines , then sweden and finally , a year ago , to flensburg . " it is friendly here and we feel free , " he said .
" that is why we will remain .
we do n't want to relive that again . " many examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik and his wife crown princess mary had no problems getting married , even though mary is australian .
about 3,000 danes marry foreigners every year and many of them leave the country , usually to live in sweden or germany .
if they marry a non-eu national , they can only live in denmark under certain conditions .
for example , the foreign spouse must be at least 24 years old .
and in each case , immigration officials have the sole right to decide whether it is a valid marriage . this practice does not correspond with eu laws , said elsebeth gerner nielsen , a representative of the opposition social liberals in the danish parliament . " we in denmark have unfortunately not consulted eu law , " she said .
" we still have old danish rules here . " reducing immigration denmark has a special status in the eu .
that is how the conservative ruling party was able to strengthen the immigration rules in 2002 .
about 7 percent of the population in denmark is foreign .
" we want to reduce immigration in order to improve integration of immigrants already here , " said immigration minister rikke hvilshoey .
" through the new law , the children of immigrants have a better chance in the workplace . " but nielsen believes the law will only make things worse . " the concerns over immigration are in western denmark where there are hardly any immigrants , " she said .
" in copenhagen , where most foreigners live , people say they have no problems with it . " but the social liberal party stands alone in their views .
even the social democrats backed the conservatives in the plan . so thousands more international couples will continue to follow the footsteps of steen and jane back hansen - to live out their married lives beyond denmark 's borders . jens wellhörner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where gay marriage is just marriage as the gay marriage debate continues in the u.s. and canada , many european countries are looking on bemusedly .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .
gustavo aristegui is a spokesperson for spain 's main opposition party , the conservative popular party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom and democracy after four decades " our transition from dictatorship to democracy is an example in europe and i think that we 've got to cherish this and not re-open wounds that have healed , " he said .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .
his lawyer , robert amsterdam , said his client 's arrest and trial was the culmination of a vicious campaign by putin to eliminate political opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin allegedly saw in khodorkosvky a potential political opponent outside of the courtroom in moscow , supporters and opponents gathered in anticipation of the verdict .

" russian officials on april 27 postponed the verdict on the trial , which wrapped up on april 11 .
opponents said putin was trying to avoid tough questions as he welcomed world leaders , including president george w. bush , to moscow to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii on may 9 .

it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .

but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .

retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .

" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .

it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .

germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .

and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.05.2005 germans offer theory on whale strandings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more whales are beached when the sun 's activity is high surges of solar activity may cause whales to run aground , possibly by disrupting the creatures ' internal compass , german scientists at the university of kiel suggest . university of kiel researchers klaus vaneslow and klaus ricklefs looked at sightings of sperm whales found beached in the north sea between 1712 and 2003 . they then compared this record with another set of historical data - astronomers ' observations of sunspots , which is an indicator of solar radiation .
more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.05.2005 life beyond frankfurters ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer , top dog among germany 's sassy , young tv chefs young , " hip " tv cooks including and modeled on britain 's jamie oliver have developed a significant audience in germany .
it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .
people find that in the star cook and in the new organic supermarkets . "
centuries of bad food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi but it seems incongruous that in a country where discount supermarkets are experiencing an unprecedented boom , germans would spend their money on the high quality ingredients that the tv chefs stress .
and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that . '
it 's still applicable today , " siebeck said . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.05.2005 life beyond frankfurters ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer , top dog among germany 's sassy , young tv chefs young , " hip " tv cooks including and modeled on britain 's jamie oliver have developed a significant audience in germany .
it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .
people find that in the star cook and in the new organic supermarkets . "
centuries of bad food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi but it seems incongruous that in a country where discount supermarkets are experiencing an unprecedented boom , germans would spend their money on the high quality ingredients that the tv chefs stress .
and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that . '
it 's still applicable today , " siebeck said . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .
-lrb- dec .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .
his lawyer , robert amsterdam , said his client 's arrest and trial was the culmination of a vicious campaign by putin to eliminate political opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin allegedly saw in khodorkosvky a potential political opponent outside of the courtroom in moscow , supporters and opponents gathered in anticipation of the verdict .
khodorkovsky lawyer sanford saunders was pessimistic upon entering the court room monday morning . " mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev will be convicted today … and the verdict will not represent the evidence , " saunders told television cameras .
west skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the moscow courtoom , with photos of khodorkovsky in the background in his closing statements , khodorkovsky has said the trial " was contrived " by the kremlin " with the aim of taking for themselves the most profitable oil company in russia . " russian officials on april 27 postponed the verdict on the trial , which wrapped up on april 11 .
opponents said putin was trying to avoid tough questions as he welcomed world leaders , including president george w. bush , to moscow to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii on may 9 .
the western world has kept a close eye on the trial .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a visit to moscow in april that " people are really watching -lrb- the trial -rrb- for signals that indeed there is rule of law in russia . " germany market-oriented germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder seems less perturbed by the case .
the chancellor , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it was n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a close relationship with the russian president german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verdict in yukos trial postponed the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .
gustavo aristegui is a spokesperson for spain 's main opposition party , the conservative popular party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom and democracy after four decades " our transition from dictatorship to democracy is an example in europe and i think that we 've got to cherish this and not re-open wounds that have healed , " he said . " leave things be , it 's not an issue anymore , i mean people on the street are not worried about these things anymore .

the 56-year-old organization will adopt three conventions on preventing and financing terrorism and human trafficking during the gathering . other issues on the agenda include the protection of minorities , free movement of europeans across the continent and violence against children .
the council 's future goals will be defined in a new political mandate meant to ensure that its activities remain relevant to the 800 million people who live in its 46 member states . " i 'm hoping the summit agrees to put more emphasis on democracy as it is clear from many countries , ukraine and georgia are two , that people want more democracy , " the council 's secretary general , terry davis , told reuters news agency . " we 're looking to expand to central asia and develop relations .

" we would welcome something really constructive coming from there , but we are sceptical , " said brigitte dufour , deputy executive director of the helsinki foundation for human rights .

among those who have confirmed they will attend the summit are german chancellor gerhard schröder , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , georgian leader mikhail saakashvili and the presidents of the three baltic states . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was also due to attend , as was russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , british deputy prime minister john prescott , french foreign minister michel barnier and prince albert of monaco , the latest country to join the council , in october last year . some 10,000 police officers will be deployed around the capital , and roads leading to the royal castle near warsaw 's old town will be closed to traffic , officials said . " we have to be ready for all sorts of threats , be they terrorist or related to anti-globalization protesters , " the deputy commander of the police force for the warsaw region , andrzej palczewski told afp . several hundred anti-globalization protesters plan to demonstrate on monday near the royal castle , where the leaders will gather under a large marquee to hold their summit . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .
his lawyer , robert amsterdam , said his client 's arrest and trial was the culmination of a vicious campaign by putin to eliminate political opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin allegedly saw in khodorkosvky a potential political opponent outside of the courtroom in moscow , supporters and opponents gathered in anticipation of the verdict .
khodorkovsky lawyer sanford saunders was pessimistic upon entering the court room monday morning . " mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev will be convicted today … and the verdict will not represent the evidence , " saunders told television cameras .
west skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the moscow courtoom , with photos of khodorkovsky in the background in his closing statements , khodorkovsky has said the trial " was contrived " by the kremlin " with the aim of taking for themselves the most profitable oil company in russia . " russian officials on april 27 postponed the verdict on the trial , which wrapped up on april 11 .
opponents said putin was trying to avoid tough questions as he welcomed world leaders , including president george w. bush , to moscow to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii on may 9 .
the western world has kept a close eye on the trial .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a visit to moscow in april that " people are really watching -lrb- the trial -rrb- for signals that indeed there is rule of law in russia . " germany market-oriented germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder seems less perturbed by the case .
the chancellor , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it was n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a close relationship with the russian president german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verdict in yukos trial postponed the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow .
-lrb- april 27 , 2005 -rrb- schröder not worried about yukos affair in moscow for a one-day visit to boost german-russian business ties , german chancellor gerhard schröder praised russian president vladimir putin 's economic reform course and said he had faith in russia 's judicial system .

the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .

the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .
gustavo aristegui is a spokesperson for spain 's main opposition party , the conservative popular party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom and democracy after four decades " our transition from dictatorship to democracy is an example in europe and i think that we 've got to cherish this and not re-open wounds that have healed , " he said . " leave things be , it 's not an issue anymore , i mean people on the street are not worried about these things anymore .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .

but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .

on the streets of madrid , most people think it is about time the valley of the fallen was changed . " i think it 's alright to change it because there is no museum of the civil war for instance , there is no nothing at all for that , " said one pedestrian named javier .
" so i think that they want to forget it and the people want to remember so not to happen again . i hope there will be a debate for it . "
but that 's not a view shared by the franco foundation - a privately funded group dedicated to preserving the history of the franco years . their office is like a snapshot from the fascist past - dimly lit rooms , eagle-headed flags hanging from the walls , franco busts and photos everywhere . there are even old maps rolled up on tables as though the generalissimo himself is about to enter and plan his next move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some revere him still " i do n't believe it is a monument to franco , it 's not a personal monument to anyone , " said felipe moralez , deputy director of the franco foundation .
" but the bodies of soldiers from both sides in the war of 1936 are buried there . it 's neither a monument to franco or -lrb- fascism -rrb- . " but to some , a place of homage it 's an argument that does have validity : thousands of bodies , both nationalist and republican are buried in the monument . when this colossal structure was finished in 1959 , franco did dedicate it to national reconciliation . but there 's still no information telling visitors that republican prisoners of war - thirty thousand of them - actually built it .
and the monument certainly has n't reconciled many spaniards .
emilo silva calls it franco 's version of an egyptian pyramid , built by him to glorify his memory .
many refuse to visit it for that reason .
but for a small number of others , it is a place of homage .
the falange , still a legal political party in spain , gather each year in the valley of the fallen to mark franco 's death and think changing the monument is like trying to rewrite the past . " we think that it 's very dangerous for our history to eliminate only one part of spain 's history , " said fernando canda la piedra , head of the falange party .
" i think it should stay like it is now because no one can say what is good and what is bad history . "
but if the falange is still living in the past , spanish society has moved on .
even most of those on the right of the political spectrum think it 's important to provide accurate historical information on the site , and in a manner that is respectful to both sides .
in many ways , many say this is a battle for control of spain 's history . but it 's certain that franco 's valley of the fallen will be changed and with those changes spain is making an important gesture towards the past and its future . danny wood -lrb- jb -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain says resounding yes to eu constitution spaniards gave a strong seal of approval to the new european constitution in a sunday referendum , with four in five of those casting ballots backing the text , exit polls showed .

it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .
people find that in the star cook and in the new organic supermarkets . "
centuries of bad food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi but it seems incongruous that in a country where discount supermarkets are experiencing an unprecedented boom , germans would spend their money on the high quality ingredients that the tv chefs stress .
and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that . '
it 's still applicable today , " siebeck said . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .
gustavo aristegui is a spokesperson for spain 's main opposition party , the conservative popular party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom and democracy after four decades " our transition from dictatorship to democracy is an example in europe and i think that we 've got to cherish this and not re-open wounds that have healed , " he said . " leave things be , it 's not an issue anymore , i mean people on the street are not worried about these things anymore .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .

" in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .
his lawyer , robert amsterdam , said his client 's arrest and trial was the culmination of a vicious campaign by putin to eliminate political opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin allegedly saw in khodorkosvky a potential political opponent outside of the courtroom in moscow , supporters and opponents gathered in anticipation of the verdict .
khodorkovsky lawyer sanford saunders was pessimistic upon entering the court room monday morning . " mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev will be convicted today … and the verdict will not represent the evidence , " saunders told television cameras .
west skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the moscow courtoom , with photos of khodorkovsky in the background in his closing statements , khodorkovsky has said the trial " was contrived " by the kremlin " with the aim of taking for themselves the most profitable oil company in russia . " russian officials on april 27 postponed the verdict on the trial , which wrapped up on april 11 .
opponents said putin was trying to avoid tough questions as he welcomed world leaders , including president george w. bush , to moscow to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii on may 9 .
the western world has kept a close eye on the trial .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a visit to moscow in april that " people are really watching -lrb- the trial -rrb- for signals that indeed there is rule of law in russia . " germany market-oriented germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder seems less perturbed by the case .
the chancellor , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it was n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a close relationship with the russian president german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verdict in yukos trial postponed the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.05.2005 life beyond frankfurters ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer , top dog among germany 's sassy , young tv chefs young , " hip " tv cooks including and modeled on britain 's jamie oliver have developed a significant audience in germany .
it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .
people find that in the star cook and in the new organic supermarkets . "
centuries of bad food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi but it seems incongruous that in a country where discount supermarkets are experiencing an unprecedented boom , germans would spend their money on the high quality ingredients that the tv chefs stress .
and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that . '
it 's still applicable today , " siebeck said . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

his lawyer , robert amsterdam , said his client 's arrest and trial was the culmination of a vicious campaign by putin to eliminate political opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin allegedly saw in khodorkosvky a potential political opponent outside of the courtroom in moscow , supporters and opponents gathered in anticipation of the verdict .
khodorkovsky lawyer sanford saunders was pessimistic upon entering the court room monday morning . " mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev will be convicted today … and the verdict will not represent the evidence , " saunders told television cameras .
west skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the moscow courtoom , with photos of khodorkovsky in the background in his closing statements , khodorkovsky has said the trial " was contrived " by the kremlin " with the aim of taking for themselves the most profitable oil company in russia . " russian officials on april 27 postponed the verdict on the trial , which wrapped up on april 11 .
opponents said putin was trying to avoid tough questions as he welcomed world leaders , including president george w. bush , to moscow to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii on may 9 .
the western world has kept a close eye on the trial .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a visit to moscow in april that " people are really watching -lrb- the trial -rrb- for signals that indeed there is rule of law in russia . " germany market-oriented germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder seems less perturbed by the case .
the chancellor , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it was n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a close relationship with the russian president german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verdict in yukos trial postponed the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow .

it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .

they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .

these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .

"
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .

the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .
his lawyer , robert amsterdam , said his client 's arrest and trial was the culmination of a vicious campaign by putin to eliminate political opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin allegedly saw in khodorkosvky a potential political opponent outside of the courtroom in moscow , supporters and opponents gathered in anticipation of the verdict .
khodorkovsky lawyer sanford saunders was pessimistic upon entering the court room monday morning . " mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev will be convicted today … and the verdict will not represent the evidence , " saunders told television cameras .
west skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the moscow courtoom , with photos of khodorkovsky in the background in his closing statements , khodorkovsky has said the trial " was contrived " by the kremlin " with the aim of taking for themselves the most profitable oil company in russia . " russian officials on april 27 postponed the verdict on the trial , which wrapped up on april 11 .
opponents said putin was trying to avoid tough questions as he welcomed world leaders , including president george w. bush , to moscow to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii on may 9 .
the western world has kept a close eye on the trial .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a visit to moscow in april that " people are really watching -lrb- the trial -rrb- for signals that indeed there is rule of law in russia . " germany market-oriented germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder seems less perturbed by the case .
the chancellor , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it was n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a close relationship with the russian president german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 16.05.2005 life beyond frankfurters ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim mälzer , top dog among germany 's sassy , young tv chefs young , " hip " tv cooks including and modeled on britain 's jamie oliver have developed a significant audience in germany .
it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks in the united states .
germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .
people find that in the star cook and in the new organic supermarkets . "
centuries of bad food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi but it seems incongruous that in a country where discount supermarkets are experiencing an unprecedented boom , germans would spend their money on the high quality ingredients that the tv chefs stress .
and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that . '
it 's still applicable today , " siebeck said . nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " bio food " goes big in germany organic food has long been popular among germans , but while such products have been sold in small stores so far , supermarket-style venues focusing exclusively on so-called " bio food " are becoming more prevalent .

it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .

germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .
" the people who embody these new values make up his following . " but opinions differ about whether more people are cooking themselves or merely watching more of it done on tv . " it 's only voyeurism , watching but not doing , " roman retzbach of future-institute international said .
retzbach posited people 's withdrawal into their own four walls has them sitting in front of the tube but not buying cookbooks to take a stab at it themselves . but eike wenzel pointed to the undeniably huge demand for organic food as evidence that germans are indeed interested in cooking .
" what the star cooks show is that health and pleasure can go together .

centuries of bad food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : discounter aldi but it seems incongruous that in a country where discount supermarkets are experiencing an unprecedented boom , germans would spend their money on the high quality ingredients that the tv chefs stress .
and the fact that they 've started buying organically grown food does n't mean they know what to do with it or that their tastes are becoming more refined . " we have always eaten badly , " explained wolfram siebeck .
" since the 30 years war the germans were always poor .
they have always just taken what is there : potatoes , potatoes , potatoes . "
siebeck conceded that germans ' approach to food has changed over the last century , but said it still has a long way to go despite the helping hand from oliver and company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sauerbraten , a typical german dish " it 's been 20 years since i wrote the sentence : ' cooking badly is n't an achievement , but then being proud of it - only the germans can do that .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .
gustavo aristegui is a spokesperson for spain 's main opposition party , the conservative popular party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freedom and democracy after four decades " our transition from dictatorship to democracy is an example in europe and i think that we 've got to cherish this and not re-open wounds that have healed , " he said .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .

these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .

on the streets of madrid , most people think it is about time the valley of the fallen was changed . " i think it 's alright to change it because there is no museum of the civil war for instance , there is no nothing at all for that , " said one pedestrian named javier .
" so i think that they want to forget it and the people want to remember so not to happen again . i hope there will be a debate for it . "
but that 's not a view shared by the franco foundation - a privately funded group dedicated to preserving the history of the franco years . their office is like a snapshot from the fascist past - dimly lit rooms , eagle-headed flags hanging from the walls , franco busts and photos everywhere . there are even old maps rolled up on tables as though the generalissimo himself is about to enter and plan his next move . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some revere him still " i do n't believe it is a monument to franco , it 's not a personal monument to anyone , " said felipe moralez , deputy director of the franco foundation .
" but the bodies of soldiers from both sides in the war of 1936 are buried there . it 's neither a monument to franco or -lrb- fascism -rrb- . " but to some , a place of homage it 's an argument that does have validity : thousands of bodies , both nationalist and republican are buried in the monument . when this colossal structure was finished in 1959 , franco did dedicate it to national reconciliation . but there 's still no information telling visitors that republican prisoners of war - thirty thousand of them - actually built it .
and the monument certainly has n't reconciled many spaniards .
emilo silva calls it franco 's version of an egyptian pyramid , built by him to glorify his memory .
many refuse to visit it for that reason .
but for a small number of others , it is a place of homage .
the falange , still a legal political party in spain , gather each year in the valley of the fallen to mark franco 's death and think changing the monument is like trying to rewrite the past . " we think that it 's very dangerous for our history to eliminate only one part of spain 's history , " said fernando canda la piedra , head of the falange party .
" i think it should stay like it is now because no one can say what is good and what is bad history . "
but if the falange is still living in the past , spanish society has moved on .
even most of those on the right of the political spectrum think it 's important to provide accurate historical information on the site , and in a manner that is respectful to both sides .
in many ways , many say this is a battle for control of spain 's history . but it 's certain that franco 's valley of the fallen will be changed and with those changes spain is making an important gesture towards the past and its future . danny wood -lrb- jb -rrb- back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de spain says resounding yes to eu constitution spaniards gave a strong seal of approval to the new european constitution in a sunday referendum , with four in five of those casting ballots backing the text , exit polls showed .

the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .

it looks like the " cooking is cool " craze has finally taken off here - or has it ? the germans are notorious for looking to london for new trends , and when it comes to the new lot of tv chefs , it seems they 've done it again .
the current generation of young , male chefs whipping their creams and flipping their steaks for german viewers can be attributed to no other than english star chef jamie oliver .
decked out in jeans and t-shirts in their airy , colorful kitchens , the german chefs , like their english model , do their darndest to show that cooking is cool . hamburg chef tim mälzer , whose web site brags that he worked side-by-side with oliver in london for a time , is currently the most successful of the new lot .
on average , over 1.5 million people tune into the 32-year-old 's daily show , far surpassing oliver 's german ratings of around 370,000 viewers .
besides mälzer and oliver , 34-year-old ralf zacherl is currently experimenting with different formats , now demonstrating his skills on kids ' show " planet cook , " and , along with two other cooking colleagues , in a recently launched documentary soap . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfram siebeck , germany 's cookery pope " i find cooking shows ever more superfluous .
they have become entertainment , " said wolfram siebeck -lrb- photo -rrb- , germany 's most prominent food writer and a one-time tv chef himself .
but siebeck credits jamie oliver and his german imitators with a different approach .
they come across as being cool and relaxed in their cooking , taking away the intimidating aura that emanated from professional tv chefs of the past .
by not putting value on exact measurements or cooking times , the new crew in the studio kitchens gives home cooks the freedom to play .
withdrawing into the home it 's not just this new laid-back attitude to making food that has resulted in the new crop of german cooking shows .
as in britain , trend researchers trace the enthusiasm to social changes in the wake of the sept .

germans , like people elsewhere in the west , have shifted their focus towards the home , which is reflected in the success of the shows . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jamie oliver " jamie oliver -lrb- photo -rrb- is a good example of the change in social values : that family is important again , that there 's a new form of socializing which is being re-discovered , " future consultant eike wenzel of germany 's zukunftsinstitut gmbh said .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .

the end of world war ii did n't mean an end for fascist dictatorships in western europe - in spain , francisco franco ruled until his death in 1975 .
and only now , some say , is spain truly confronting his legacy . in a souvenir shop in the middle of madrid 's wealthy salamanca district , there is a steady stream of customers who drop in to buy a pendant or a piece of memorabilia .
but instead of plastic figures of flamenco dancers or matadors , this shop sells another type of souvenir - those of the franco regime . there are bracelets and badges and flags , the eagle flag , various metal pendants and even an identity card of franco , a pretend one with his thumb-print on the side .
there is also a picture of tejero , the man who attempted the coup back in 1981 that was an attempt to overthrow the democratic government of spain . paco has run this shop for nearly thirty years . he says he 's a proud supporter of the falange , spain 's equivalent of the nazis . split society after decades of dictatorship , feelings in spain towards its fascist past are very different to those in germany , which has spent decades confronting its nazi history . many argue that only now spanish society is really dealing with this part of its history . for example , three decades after franco 's death , the government is finally willing to make changes to franco 's most imposing legacy : the valley of the fallen .
this colossal burial chamber with its own church and monastery was built by franco using republican prisoners of war as slave labor . spain 's government is about to make an historic decision that could change this enormous monument into an education centre about fascism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : his legacy lives on at the same time , a shop like this is very indicative of the contradictions in spain 's modern democracy , ones illustrated by the customers who come here . they 're not neo-nazi thugs or fascists , but mainstream spaniards including lots of young people .
these days , large numbers of spaniards on the right do n't feel shame about or responsibility for their fascist past . and many on the left of spanish politics - those whose families fought for the losing republican side during the civil war in the 1930s - still feel that spanish society is divided into the winners of that war and the losers . those on the winning side reaped the benefits of the victory , access to the best schools and the best jobs ; the losers were excluded from society and still feel the consequences of losing in the civil war today . emilio silva , from a nationwide association called recovering the historical memory says the fascist past still has n't been properly dealt with .
" in spain , we have a lot of consequences , cultural consequences of the dictatorship , " he said . " if we look at the past and we know the past , we can be more free . i think it 's like psychoanalysis because we have to talk about our past to be a healthy society and i think it is very important . "
no accounting for the bodies there is plenty of critical literature about the franco years but there 's been no official calling to account for the crimes of dictatorship and no official recognition for the thousands who disappeared during those repressive four decades . many are still in mass graves scattered about the country .
only now the government has decided to make significant moves to set the record straight .
within months , changes will be made to franco 's most impressive legacy : a huge monument just outside madrid , including his burial chamber , a church and a monastery .
some political groups want the dictator 's remains moved from the site .
most just want basic information telling visitors the historical facts about the monument .
but not everyone is enthusiastic about the proposed changes .

the 56-year-old organization will adopt three conventions on preventing and financing terrorism and human trafficking during the gathering . other issues on the agenda include the protection of minorities , free movement of europeans across the continent and violence against children .
the council 's future goals will be defined in a new political mandate meant to ensure that its activities remain relevant to the 800 million people who live in its 46 member states . " i 'm hoping the summit agrees to put more emphasis on democracy as it is clear from many countries , ukraine and georgia are two , that people want more democracy , " the council 's secretary general , terry davis , told reuters news agency . " we 're looking to expand to central asia and develop relations .
it might well be that at some point in the future the heads of states would like the council 's boundaries to be expanded , " davis said , adding that expansion was not on the warsaw summit 's agenda . talking shop ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe the council of europe is often regarded as the conscience of europe .
formed at the end of world war ii , since 1989 it has acted as a human rights watchdog for europe 's fledgling post-communist democracies , alerting the international community to suspected abuses . human rights groups , though , expressed concern that the warsaw summit will just be a talking shop , producing little in the way of concrete results . " we would welcome something really constructive coming from there , but we are sceptical , " said brigitte dufour , deputy executive director of the helsinki foundation for human rights .
" they should feel they are the conscience of europe , but they let political , economic , even military aspects get in the way , " she told reuters . high security strict security measures were in place in warsaw on sunday as leaders began to arrive .
among those who have confirmed they will attend the summit are german chancellor gerhard schröder , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , georgian leader mikhail saakashvili and the presidents of the three baltic states . turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan was also due to attend , as was russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , british deputy prime minister john prescott , french foreign minister michel barnier and prince albert of monaco , the latest country to join the council , in october last year . some 10,000 police officers will be deployed around the capital , and roads leading to the royal castle near warsaw 's old town will be closed to traffic , officials said . " we have to be ready for all sorts of threats , be they terrorist or related to anti-globalization protesters , " the deputy commander of the police force for the warsaw region , andrzej palczewski told afp . several hundred anti-globalization protesters plan to demonstrate on monday near the royal castle , where the leaders will gather under a large marquee to hold their summit . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de terrorism tops the agenda in warsaw as the third summit of interior ministers and high-ranking government officials from the 46-member council of europe enters its last day in warsaw , talks continue to focus on tackling terrorism and organized crime .

the judge will continue reading the lengthy verdict tuesday . the arrest and trial of one of russia 's most powerful oligarchs has shaken investor confidence and put the rule of law in putin 's russia under the international microscope .
khodorkovsky and platon lebedev , his deputy in the yukos oil company , were arrested in 2003 on charges of massive fraud and tax evasion , and have been on trial since june 2004 . they each face up to 10 years in prison . yukos oil , once russia 's most profitable oil company , has since been dismantled by the kremlin after failing to pay $ 27.5 billion -lrb- 34.7 billion euros -rrb- in back taxes .
the company 's oil fields , among other assets , have gone up for auction . political martyr khodorkovsky has dismissed the trial as a fraud since his arrest in october 2003 .
the powerful oil tycoon was said to have harbored political ambitions to run against putin , and funded putin 's political opponents .
his lawyer , robert amsterdam , said his client 's arrest and trial was the culmination of a vicious campaign by putin to eliminate political opposition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin allegedly saw in khodorkosvky a potential political opponent outside of the courtroom in moscow , supporters and opponents gathered in anticipation of the verdict .
khodorkovsky lawyer sanford saunders was pessimistic upon entering the court room monday morning . " mr khodorkovsky and mr lebedev will be convicted today … and the verdict will not represent the evidence , " saunders told television cameras .
west skeptical bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators outside the moscow courtoom , with photos of khodorkovsky in the background in his closing statements , khodorkovsky has said the trial " was contrived " by the kremlin " with the aim of taking for themselves the most profitable oil company in russia . " russian officials on april 27 postponed the verdict on the trial , which wrapped up on april 11 .
opponents said putin was trying to avoid tough questions as he welcomed world leaders , including president george w. bush , to moscow to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the end of wwii on may 9 .
the western world has kept a close eye on the trial .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice said after a visit to moscow in april that " people are really watching -lrb- the trial -rrb- for signals that indeed there is rule of law in russia . " germany market-oriented germany 's chancellor gerhard schröder seems less perturbed by the case .
the chancellor , who has a close working relationship with putin , has said that it was n't unusual for the state to prosecute someone for tax evasion .
following summits with putin in the past year , he said that he has confidence that a just result will be reached . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder has a close relationship with the russian president german gas companies have watched the smashing of yukos with interest .
utility giants e.on and rwe already have stakes in russia 's vast and profitable energy sector , and have looked at the auction of yukos assets with interest . khodorkovsky lawyer amsterdam said market access has steered schröder 's ambivalence towards khodorkovsky 's fate .
" the german chancellor worked as an accomplice to the kremlin 's theft , " amsterdam said in an interview with berliner zeitung in april . dw staff -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de verdict in yukos trial postponed the eagerly anticipated verdict in the trial of yukos oil giant founder mikhail khodorkovsky was unexpectedly postponed wednesday amid speculation russia wanted to avoid controversy ahead of wwii celebrations in moscow .

more whale strandings occurred when the sun 's activity is high , they found . the sun experiences cycles of activity which range from eight to 17 years , with 11 years being the average .
short cycles are linked with periods of high energy output , while long cycles are believed to be low energy . changes in levels of solar radiation have a big effect on earth 's magnetic field .
the most notable events are gouts of highly-charged particles , called solar flares , that cause shimmering lights , called aurorae , in the magnetic fields in polar regions . big solar flares can also disrupt telecommunications and power lines and knock out delicate electronic circuitry on satellites . the researchers found that of the 97 stranding events reported around the coastal countries of the north sea over the 291 years , 90 percent occurred when the sun cycles was below average in duration . magnetic orientation the vanselow team speculate that whales may have a magnetic sense of orientation like pigeons , which are believed to navigate thanks to small magnetic crystals on their beaks . what could happen is that male sperm whales , following a migratory path from the norwegian sea , could become disorientated by minor changes in the geomagnetic field as they enter the north sea , the pair suggest . " in this shallow-shelf sea with a contourless seabed , often with soft bottom sediments , their deep-water sonar and other adaptations to their normal habitat may not function properly , " they say . previous studies have suggested that powerful marine sonar could be to blame for whale strandings by messing up the whales ' sense of direction and depth . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dead sperm whales on the island of romoe in the north sea off western denmark , wednesday , march 27 , 1996 .
an october 2003 study by british and spanish marine pathologists , based on autopsies carried out on 10 beaked whales that beached in the canary islands a few hours after a spanish-led naval task force passed by , found that the cetaceans had suffered a mortal attack of the " bends . " tissue dissection showed that the whales ' livers and other internal organs were filled with gas bubbles , and smaller blood vessels had been literally blown apart from inside . the injuries were consistent with decompression sickness , in which nitrogen gas , absorbed into the blood stream , expands quickly as a submerged mammal rises to the surface , forming bubbles that can clot or breach blood vessels . the latest study is published in the journal of sea research , published by the netherlands-based elsevier group . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany opens world 's biggest solar plant the world ’ s biggest solar power plant was inaugurated in the german town of espenhain wednesday .

on the other side is denmark , his homeland of 50 years .
but it is there that he , with his wife jane , is n't permitted to live .
and the relationship had begun so promisingly . " we married in 2002 , " he said .
" jane has a sister who has lived in denmark since 1991 and came to visit .
we met and it was love at first sight . " after marrying , they applied for residency for 25-year-old jane at a local police station . " they questioned us separately , " she recalled .
" they were trying to be nice but in reality , they reported that my husband had only married me to get me into the country . " jane is 21 years younger than her husband - too big an age difference , the immigration authorities decided .
it just could n't be love .
so they declared the marriage " fictitious " and told jane to leave the country .
she did and he followed her , to the philippines , then sweden and finally , a year ago , to flensburg . " it is friendly here and we feel free , " he said .
" that is why we will remain .
we do n't want to relive that again . " many examples bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : denmark 's crown prince frederik and his wife crown princess mary had no problems getting married , even though mary is australian .
about 3,000 danes marry foreigners every year and many of them leave the country , usually to live in sweden or germany .
if they marry a non-eu national , they can only live in denmark under certain conditions .
for example , the foreign spouse must be at least 24 years old .
and in each case , immigration officials have the sole right to decide whether it is a valid marriage . this practice does not correspond with eu laws , said elsebeth gerner nielsen , a representative of the opposition social liberals in the danish parliament . " we in denmark have unfortunately not consulted eu law , " she said .
" we still have old danish rules here . " reducing immigration denmark has a special status in the eu .
that is how the conservative ruling party was able to strengthen the immigration rules in 2002 .
about 7 percent of the population in denmark is foreign .
" we want to reduce immigration in order to improve integration of immigrants already here , " said immigration minister rikke hvilshoey .
" through the new law , the children of immigrants have a better chance in the workplace . " but nielsen believes the law will only make things worse . " the concerns over immigration are in western denmark where there are hardly any immigrants , " she said .
" in copenhagen , where most foreigners live , people say they have no problems with it . " but the social liberal party stands alone in their views .
even the social democrats backed the conservatives in the plan . so thousands more international couples will continue to follow the footsteps of steen and jane back hansen - to live out their married lives beyond denmark 's borders . jens wellhörner -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : where gay marriage is just marriage as the gay marriage debate continues in the u.s. and canada , many european countries are looking on bemusedly .

his pursuit of manchester united has made him a household name in uk financial circles and a figure of suspicion for many ordinary fans .
however , malcolm glazer 's background could n't be any further removed from the glamour and drama of the ' theatre of dreams ' .
from a lithuanian family which emigrated to the united states , he was born in 1928 , just as the wall street crash was about to propel america into a decade-long depression .
hands-on the budding tycoon grew up in rochester , new york state , what was then a provincial town an hour from the canadian border and 300 miles north of new york city .
his father ran a store selling watch parts and it was in this humble setting , that he first cut his teeth in business after his father 's death in 1943 .
harley-davidson slipped through mr glazer 's hands in 1989 over the next thirty years , the aspiring businessman steadily transformed his small inheritance into a growing business empire , thanks to a series of shrewd investments .
yet , it was not until well into his mid fifties that mr glazer was to become embroiled in his first takeover battle .
american icons in 1984 , he launched an unsuccessful $ 7.6bn -lrb- £ 4bn -rrb- bid to buy the bankrupt freight rail company , conrail , reputedly backed up by just £ 100m of his own money .
the bid may have come off the rails but mr glazer avoided being shunted into the sidings .
he successfully invested in a range of business spanning television , restaurants and property .
he became famous for stalking icons of american life such as kitchen designer formica and motorcycle manufacturer harley-davidson .
neither of these deals ultimately came off but his willingness to take a gamble and put himself in the firing line was clear .
this hard edge was not merely confined to his public life .
in 1980 , glazer took his five sisters to court in a dispute over their mother 's will .
sporting passion however , it was in the bearpit of american football that he was really to make his business reputation and cement his fortune .
in 1995 , he paid $ 192m for the underperforming nfl football team , the tampa bay buccaneers .
quickly proving that he would n't just sit on the touchline , he sacked the team 's coach at the end of his first season .
several unremarkable seasons followed and the new owner incurred the wrath of the team 's fans by threatening to move the team out of the city .
malcolm glazer has yet to win round many manchester utd fans in 2003 , he spent $ 8m on luring one of the sport 's most successful coaches , jon gruden , from rival team , the oakland raiders .
the gamble paid off and that same year , the buccaneers went on to win the superbowl .
his investment in the club was said to have quadrupled in value .
however , he was n't content to sit on his laurels .
he soon tried and failed to buy the los angeles dodgers baseball team .
on the ball more significantly , it was in march 2003 - the year that manchester united last won the premiership title - that mr glazer first paid £ 9m to buy into britain 's biggest football club .
any suggestions that he was merely in it for the prawn sandwiches were quickly dispelled as the tycoon 's stake steadily rose , hitting 28 % last october .
the talk was of a bidding war between him and two other legendary gamblers , financiers jp mcmanus and john magnier who had also built up a significant holding in the club .
after the club rebuffed an informal takeover approach last november , mr glazer showed his ruthless streak , effectively forcing three united directors off the board .
this escalation of hostilities was seen as a mistake by some and mr glazer 's main financial backer , jp morgan , promptly withdrew .
however , the american proved undaunted and returned with more detailed takeover proposals and fresh backers in february .
the fans may not have liked it but mr glazer was proving , not for the first time , that he would n't take no for an answer .

his pursuit of manchester united has made him a household name in uk financial circles and a figure of suspicion for many ordinary fans .
however , malcolm glazer 's background could n't be any further removed from the glamour and drama of the ' theatre of dreams ' .
from a lithuanian family which emigrated to the united states , he was born in 1928 , just as the wall street crash was about to propel america into a decade-long depression .
hands-on the budding tycoon grew up in rochester , new york state , what was then a provincial town an hour from the canadian border and 300 miles north of new york city .
his father ran a store selling watch parts and it was in this humble setting , that he first cut his teeth in business after his father 's death in 1943 .
harley-davidson slipped through mr glazer 's hands in 1989 over the next thirty years , the aspiring businessman steadily transformed his small inheritance into a growing business empire , thanks to a series of shrewd investments .
yet , it was not until well into his mid fifties that mr glazer was to become embroiled in his first takeover battle .
american icons in 1984 , he launched an unsuccessful $ 7.6bn -lrb- £ 4bn -rrb- bid to buy the bankrupt freight rail company , conrail , reputedly backed up by just £ 100m of his own money .
the bid may have come off the rails but mr glazer avoided being shunted into the sidings .
he successfully invested in a range of business spanning television , restaurants and property .
he became famous for stalking icons of american life such as kitchen designer formica and motorcycle manufacturer harley-davidson .
neither of these deals ultimately came off but his willingness to take a gamble and put himself in the firing line was clear .
this hard edge was not merely confined to his public life .
in 1980 , glazer took his five sisters to court in a dispute over their mother 's will .
sporting passion however , it was in the bearpit of american football that he was really to make his business reputation and cement his fortune .
in 1995 , he paid $ 192m for the underperforming nfl football team , the tampa bay buccaneers .
quickly proving that he would n't just sit on the touchline , he sacked the team 's coach at the end of his first season .
several unremarkable seasons followed and the new owner incurred the wrath of the team 's fans by threatening to move the team out of the city .
malcolm glazer has yet to win round many manchester utd fans in 2003 , he spent $ 8m on luring one of the sport 's most successful coaches , jon gruden , from rival team , the oakland raiders .
the gamble paid off and that same year , the buccaneers went on to win the superbowl .
his investment in the club was said to have quadrupled in value .
however , he was n't content to sit on his laurels .
he soon tried and failed to buy the los angeles dodgers baseball team .
on the ball more significantly , it was in march 2003 - the year that manchester united last won the premiership title - that mr glazer first paid £ 9m to buy into britain 's biggest football club .
any suggestions that he was merely in it for the prawn sandwiches were quickly dispelled as the tycoon 's stake steadily rose , hitting 28 % last october .

third generation mobile technology , 3g , came off the worst in a report into people 's understanding and take-up of technologies .
seventy-six percent either do not know , are misinformed or can not explain 3g .
many have become confused and are bombarded with information which turns them off experimenting with technology .
people also feel they can not take up the opportunities new technologies have to offer , even if they wanted to , because the prices are still too high , ofcom 's independent consumer panel report found .
it is of serious concern to us that so many customers feel it is so hard to grapple with new advances related to phones , tv , radio and the internet colette bowe , consumer panel although people broadly knew what terms such as " broadband " and " digital tv " were , less that a third knew what " digital switchover " meant .
that is the term which describes the change from analogue to digital broadcasting that is taking place across britain .
grappling with the new most had " heard of " digital radio , but less than half asked actually understood to what it really referred .
" our research provides a firm stake in the ground for the communications market , " said colette bowe , the consumer panel chair .
technological awareness broadband : 62 % aware of / understand it digital tv : 70 % aware of / understand it digital radio : 47 % aware / understand 3g : 15 % aware / understand source : ofcom independent consumer panel " it is of serious concern to us that so many customers feel it is so hard to grapple with new advances related to phones , tv , radio and the internet . "
the report also found that even though knowledge of 3g was generally low , those with lower incomes tended to live in households with mobile phones , rather than landline connections .
they are paying proportionately more than higher income households for their phone bills through pre-pay deals though .
third generation mobile services have had a hard time capturing the public 's enthusiasm .
a survey earlier this year found that only 4 % of those questioned said they were considering swapping their existing mobile for a new 3g handset .
quick guide broadband many cited the bewildering number of features on 3g handsets as the reason they were put off .
but others think people just do not know what they can offer them .
" one of the main reasons that 3g has failed to catch the public 's imagination is because its potential for e-commerce has n't been promoted enough , " said michael brady , mobile search firm fast .
" one of the key factors in the development of online commerce was the evolution of search on the internet .
" 3g needs to similarly be promoted as a new way to buy online .
and once again , we believe that search needs to be specifically tailored for the mobile environment to encourage the uptake of wireless commerce . "
fiddly and confusing only one in five were interested in keeping up-to-date with technological developments , according to the research .
partly , this is down to the kind of language that is used to explain technologies , what they can do for people , and how much they cost people .
the older age groups feel particularly frustrated when it comes to understanding information they are given about technologies .
older people are also especially irritated with devices and technologies that are fiddly to use , a problem shared with disabled people .
technlogy in homes 93 % households have access to a landline 79 % have a mobile 58 % have access to the net 57 % have digital tv source : ofcom independent consumer panel twice as many people with disabilities , who are also under 65 , said they found it difficult to use mobiles , than those with no disabilities .
" this is a wake up call for the industry really to listen to all its customers , not just the young , " said ms bowe .
" it makes business sense to do so and the industry risks turning off a significant amount of potential customers if it does n't act now . "
ofcom said the consumer panel would be holding workshops with industry and other groups to find out what can be done to alleviate the problems identified in the report .
among the discussion will be how to get clear , easy to understand information about products to all socio-economic groups .
it will also look at how to make it easier for people to compare prices of technologies and where they can get help when they need it .

dr gibbons said it was down to the local authority to solve the issue of " bed-blocking " in hospitals .
trust managers said tackling the issue was " our number one priority " .
cardiff council said private nursing home sales had created a shortage but it would take a year to provide 200 extra care home beds . "
there is a unique problem in cardiff which does need to be addressed " health minister dr gibbons around 180 beds are currently blocked in cardiff hospitals by patients who do not need hospital care but can not leave the wards because there is no place available in a care home .
dr gibbons told bbc wales : " he said : " i think there is a particular problem in cardiff in that they have n't got a lot of care home beds , so there is a unique problem in cardiff which does need to be addressed . "
he said the local authority was working to address this issue but said it also needed to look at promoting the independence of older and vulnerable people as well as people 's ability to live in their own homes .
he said the assembly had given money for the council to redesign social care services as well as for joint working with other relevant organisations .
he said : " from our point of view a fair amount of money has gone into assisting all local authorities .
other local authorities have demonstrated that progress can be made . "
councillor john dixon , who is responsible for social services in cardiff , said : " there is a problem in cardiff and brian gibbons is quite right , it 's down to one of basic economics .
" in cardiff you have increasing property prices so care home owners are increasingly looking to sell up as a way of realising more of their assets . "
he said the local authority had added £ 1.2m to the money it had received from the assembly for care homes services .
' regret distress ' but 200 extra care home beds and extra care housing would not be available in the city for another year , he said .
" it 's not something that can be solved overnight .
we are doing as much as we can right now but it is going to cost money . "
he said the welsh assembly and uk governments had spent money on improving bed capacity but attention was also needed in the social care sector .
" it 's no good building capacity within a hospital unless you are also looking equally at the back door of getting people out of there and into appropriate care . "
in a statement cardiff and vale nhs trust said : " we regret any distress caused by delays in our emergency unit .
" tackling delayed transfers of care is our number one priority , and 85 % of patients attending the unit are treated , and either discharged or admitted within four hours . "

the country 's solid reputation as a five-times winner has been eroded after a run of dismal results , blamed on political voting rather than lacklustre entries .
the 23-year-old londoner will attempt to make an impact with touch my fire , an uptempo song with the exotic feel of the middle east , and shades of turkey 's 2003 winner .
" i did have it in mind a little bit .
i definitely wanted that ethnic vibe .
we did some reggae tracks , but this one stood out from the rest , " she says .

but javine will not be the only entrant mixing western sounds with eastern influences - albania , cyprus and greece are also pinning their hopes on the ethnic-pop ticket .
greece 's helena paparizou is one of javine 's rivals " i 've heard the greek song .
it 's a good track - not as good as mine , though !
i ca n't see myself coming last .
i know i 'm going to be in the top ten , " she says .
" it would be a bonus to win , but it 's going to be an experience .
it 's a singing competition which should n't be taken that seriously , " adds the performer .
' visual performance ' eurovision is not only about singing and the music - many past winners have added an eye-catching visual element to their stage performance , such as the skirt-ripping routine of bucks fizz in 1981 .
" although the songs may be good , it is all about what they do on that stage to carry the whole performance off , " says javine .
" i 'll have dancers who are great - and will be singing too .
and it 's going to be a visual performance , because everyone else will be doing that .
we 'll have to pull it out of the bag , " she adds .
it 's a singing competition which should n't be taken that seriously javine hylton the singer is unfazed about performing second in the final , which is less likely to produce a eurovision winner .
" i 'm quite glad to be going on early .
i 'll be able to sit back and enjoy the rest of the show .
" everyone will be settling down to tune into eurovision at the beginning - they 'll start drifting off at the halfway point , " she says .
" it 's hard to sit through all those songs .
" my performance is more likely to be seen .
i 'm not going to let it get me down .
" i 'll just stay focussed on what i 'm doing and not worry about anyone else .
i 'm also going to enjoy myself and party , " says javine .
as for the " curse of eurovision " - which leads singers to sink without trace after they have performed at the contest - javine is not worried .
" if people like what they see , they like it .

a climber fell to his death from cliffs at rhossili , and a 29-year-old man got into difficulties as he tried to swim ashore from worms head on friday .
the search for the outdoor pursuits instructor was called off on sunday .
ian reynolds , 29 , from swansea , had been camping with a female friend when he crossed a flooded causeway to the mainland from the small island .
as the search for him continued , a climber , believed to have been in his mid-20s , fell 150ft to his death as he abseiled at fall bay , near rhossili , at around 1400 bst .
he was taken by helicopter to swansea 's morriston hospital but was pronounced dead on arrival .
within a few hours of his death , swansea coastguard confirmed that they had wound down a three-day search for mr reynolds .
walkers helped search the area for mr reynolds on saturday it emerged that he and his female friend had planned to leave the island at 0530 bst on friday - before the tide turned - but overslept .
the four-hour tide " window " recommended to cross the causeway between worm 's head and rhossili in safety ended at 0610 bst , so they decided to swim across .
as they made their way across the causeway towards the mainland , they became caught up in strong currents .
both were carrying camping gear at the time .
the woman held on to hers and used it as a buoyancy aid , but mr reynolds let go of his .
on reaching the mainland , she climbed rocks to reach an emergency telephone and raised the alarm at 0816 bst , and a major land , sea and air search and rescue operation got under way .
emergency crews had hoped mr reynolds would be found safely ashore at one of the many isolated gower beaches .
rescuers , who were among the first to arrive at the scene , said they were powerless to save mr reynolds as he was swept away by the rising tide .
mr reynolds was trying to reach the shore from worm 's head steve jones , one of the first to respond to the call , said he and his colleagues heard mr reynolds ' cries but no-one could see where he was .
" we were there within three minutes of the call-out , " he explained .
" we could hear him .
there were eight of us here , but not one of us could see him in the water . "
south wales police had appealed for anyone who had seen mr reynolds to come forward .
swansea coastguard rescue teams from rhossili and oxwich had been searching the area along with a rescue helicopter from raf chivenor in devon .
rnli inshore lifeboats were also launched from horton , port eynon and burry point , as well as rnli all weather lifeboat from the mumbles .

a new front has appeared on the forecasting horizon in the form of weatherscape xt , which has replaced the traditional symbols used for decades .
happy times the software programme uses virtual reality technology to allow the forecaster to swoop beneath clouds and move around the country .
shafts of light now denote sunshine , thunder rumbles and snow looks like the real thing .
friends of the symbol may have foreseen its fate when the weather forecast was enlisted in the bbc 's ratings battle .
they certainly would have felt a low forming when audience research showed that people found the symbols " old fashioned " and " boring " .
the feedback convinced weather bosses that for most of the 26 million viewers who rely on the forecasters in the average month , an update was needed .
have your say : what do you think of the new forecast ?
it is described by the bbc as the most radical change in 30 years and the first substantial update since the old magnetic symbols were replaced in 1985 by computer graphics .
the new technology may give viewers a clearer outlook , but for some the move comes not long after having come to terms with another huge change in the weather - the retirement of michael fish .
no flowers .

the 19-year-old 's new single entitled crazy chick , was played on radio 1 ahead of its release next month .

she said : " people are going to be very surprised to find that it 's her because of the voice because there is no hint of what she was before in it .

she clearly has got a far better voice than most of the current female pop singers .

public transport came to a standstill in nearly 100 towns and cities and many municipal offices were closed .
the government wanted to change the holiday to a normal working day and use the extra tax revenue to pay for care for the elderly .
disgruntled trade unions are holding strikes across the country .
the protest came just as political parties were launching their official campaigns over the european constitution .
most private firms were reported to be working normally , as were the big stores , and the army cancelled all leave for the day .
correspondents said many of those who stayed away were defying a centre-right government they accuse of abandoning social benefits for workers in favour of us-style free market policies .
a heatwave two years ago that killed 15,000 mainly elderly people prompted the government to scrap the holiday in order to fund measures to help older people cope .
anxious unions trade unionists are rallying against the loss of a day 's holiday , the government 's plans to loosen the rules on france 's 35-hour working week and against the european constitution .
many in the unions see the proposed constitution as a threat to the french social model .
they believe it offers the french workforce too little protection and enshrines a more anglo-saxon economic approach .
a cartoon in le parisien newspaper satirises both french fears about the constitution and the chaos surrounding this pentecost .
it has french president jacques chirac asking prime minister jean-pierre raffarin who will actually be at work in france today .
mr raffarin answers : " so far , four polish plumbers and three romanian plasterers . "
sweden has also scrapped the pentecost holiday , replacing it with a day off on the country 's flag day of 6 june .
