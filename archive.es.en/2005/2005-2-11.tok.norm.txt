program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.02.2005 germany mulls us arms partnership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's other big-budget air force project : the a400 german politicians are discussing the need to build a missile defense system against enemies that germany does n't have and with money it needs elsewhere .
the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .
struck called the project " essential for germany 's image in nato , but also with respect to its relationship with the usa . "

the finance ministry is wondering at what price .
experts like kubbig assume that the project will cost from three to four times current estimates .
the ministry 's military allowance is already maxed out with projects like the eu-developed eurofighter , the airbus 400 transport plane and the new nh 90 helicopter -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a decision will have to be made soon .
deadline for germany to sign the contract is the end of march .
the first missiles should be in service by 2012 . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans may aid us firms with ' star wars ' american defense contractors lockheed martin and northrop grumman say they will cooperate closely with european companies on the development of george w. bush 's so-called " star wars " missile defense system .

critics say minister joschka fischer treats diplomats who were once members of the nazi party shabbily . since 2003 , the internal foreign ministry newsletter has ceased to print obituaries for former members of the nazi party .
foreign minister fischer demanded the exception be made to the practice of commemorating deceased ministry workers in the circular , according to german papers . former ambassador to japan franz krapf died in october , but not a word about his death has appeared in the " internaa " newsletter .

" what more has to happen before the vip squadron gets new planes ? " he asked at a cabinet meeting shortly after being subjected to an emergency landing of one of the state 's challenger jets when the plane started smoking .
" will i have to be laid out in a coffin in the foreign ministry 's world hall first ? "
der spiegel weekly quoted the diplomat as saying . admittedly , germany 's vip fleet - in the service of the president , chancellor , cabinet , parliamentary and party leaders - is getting a bit long in the tooth .
the six " challenger " small- and mid-range jets have been flying for nearly 20 years and the seven airbus a310s are only slightly younger .
three of them were inherited from east germany 's state airlines in 1990 and the others were second-hand purchases from lufthansa around the same time . pariah planes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " challenger " jet , such as the one fischer was in that had to make an emergency landing but fischer is n't the only one unhappy with the old planes .
chancellor gerhard schröder and defense minister peter struck are well acquainted with the fleet 's weaknesses .
when the plane he was set to fly on was revealed to be defect , the chancellor recently snapped up the jet struck had booked right out from under the minister 's feet .
struck had to wait a long time for a military transporter to finally pick him up , according to der spiegel . and it 's not just government members who would rather shun the planes .
opposition cdu politician volker rühe , head of parliament 's foreign policy committee last week said the vip squadron had apparently reached the limits and alternatives , such as leasing new planes , should be examined .
" we have to act before something happens , " christian socialist defense expert christian schmidt told bild newspaper . embarrassing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder does n't always have so much company on vip flights germany 's business community is n't keen on the vip fleet either .
on a return trip from asia last year , schröder found himself in a half-full plane .
many of the top german managers in the chancellor 's entourage , including siemens ceo heinrich von pierer and then german industry association chief michael rogowski , chose to fly home with lufthansa rather then hitch a ride with schröder . von pierer has called the state planes unacceptable , while another manager complained that one of the toilet doors did n't close properly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german government plane but experts in the defense ministry , which is responsible for the vip fleet , have said that there 's currently no need to replace the planes , according to die welt daily .
the fleet is in a " technically good to very good condition , " the ministry said in a report . still , schröder is said to have asked frequent flyer fischer and struck - notorious for his tight hold on his ministry 's purse strings - to get together and discuss the matter . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus jumbo readies for take off some 5,000 guests will be among the first to cast their eyes on the world 's largest airliner , when airbus rolls out the a380 in a lavish ceremony in toulouse , france , on tuesday .

with regard to the kurdish issue , it concluded that the improvements were merely theoretical . a report by the delegation of international lawyers claims that the official representation of problems such as the kurdish issue are " largely euphemistic , if not totally false " .
the report , to which dw-world has access , said that while turkey has made many attempts towards becoming a democratic state , there is still a long way to go in putting reformed laws into practice . turkish human rights activists stressed to the delegation that " there has been no fundamental change in the mentality and thinking in the turkish government and state apparatus . "
they said the turkish government has to develop a far-reaching program for the political , socio-economic and cultural equality for the kurdish people . " and as long as they are not willing to do so , there can be no recommendation that they join the eu , " the report said .
they called for the establishment of a commission comprising ngos from both turkey and eu nations to oversee reforms relating to human rights in turkey . continued suppression bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kurdish issue rages on in turkey the six-person delegation , comprising of high-ranking german and south african lawyers , traveled to istanbul and ankara in the middle of january where they conducted numerous conversations with human rights activists , representatives of turkey 's ruling akp party and members of parliament . the lawyers stated that neither the government , the military or other political parties show a fundamental shift in thinking on the kurdish issue , and concluded that the official policy is still a long way off recognising the kurds as equals with the same rights and freedoms . despite certain legal changes , the kurdish language is still widely repressed .
there are no kurdish radio or tv stations and the two weekly half-hour programs on state television , which are repeatedly cited as progress on the kurdish issue , amount to nothing more than propaganda which has been translated into kurdish .
" nobody watches them , " one of the lawyers said .
in addition , there is still a law in effect which bans political parties from using any language other than turkish . the lawyers have called on the eu to make the kurdish issue a central element of their negotiations .
the influence of the eu in accession talks is the most effective factor for a peaceful and politically correct solution to the issue . öclan in solitary confinement during their trip , the lawyers also sought to gain an impression of the conditions in which former chairman of the kurdistan workers party , the pkk , abdullah öclan , is being held captive on the island of imrali .
in a ruling in march 2003 , the european court of justice for human rights deemed the trial against öclan unfair .
the turkish government , however , launched an appeal , and a decision on the issue is expected this spring . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah ocalan , fugitive chief of the kurdistan workers party , pkk , stands blindfolded and handcuffed in front of turkish flags before being interrogated by turkish officials at the prison-island of imrali in this photo provided by the turkish intelligence service on thursday , feb.18 , 1999 .
ocalan was captured by turkish commandos monday evening , feb .
15 , in nairobi , kenya .
-lrb- ap photo / turkish intelligence service-mit / anatolia -rrb- in the eyes of the human rights activists , there has been no change in öclan 's prison conditions .
the lawyers are involved as international observers in the öclan appeal case and were dissatisfied with the turkish justice minister 's refusal to accept a visit from the delegation for " reasons of security " . they claim that öclan is in solitary confinement , and that his relatives and lawyers are prevented from visiting him .
isolation , they said , is white torture and capable of breaking the personalities and wills of political prisoners . the report , which is due for publication later this month , says that öclan 's case is a " indicator for the credibility of the development of human rights in turkey " .
it concluded that öclan 's prison conditions have to become a central point in eu accession talks . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu membership offers hope for turkey 's kurds for over 13 million kurds living in turkey 's southeast , eu membership is a chance for more democracy in their conflict-weary region , where many fear a return of violence and unrest if ankara is denied entry .

" what more has to happen before the vip squadron gets new planes ? " he asked at a cabinet meeting shortly after being subjected to an emergency landing of one of the state 's challenger jets when the plane started smoking .
" will i have to be laid out in a coffin in the foreign ministry 's world hall first ? "
der spiegel weekly quoted the diplomat as saying . admittedly , germany 's vip fleet - in the service of the president , chancellor , cabinet , parliamentary and party leaders - is getting a bit long in the tooth .
the six " challenger " small- and mid-range jets have been flying for nearly 20 years and the seven airbus a310s are only slightly younger .
three of them were inherited from east germany 's state airlines in 1990 and the others were second-hand purchases from lufthansa around the same time . pariah planes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " challenger " jet , such as the one fischer was in that had to make an emergency landing but fischer is n't the only one unhappy with the old planes .
chancellor gerhard schröder and defense minister peter struck are well acquainted with the fleet 's weaknesses .
when the plane he was set to fly on was revealed to be defect , the chancellor recently snapped up the jet struck had booked right out from under the minister 's feet .
struck had to wait a long time for a military transporter to finally pick him up , according to der spiegel . and it 's not just government members who would rather shun the planes .
opposition cdu politician volker rühe , head of parliament 's foreign policy committee last week said the vip squadron had apparently reached the limits and alternatives , such as leasing new planes , should be examined .
" we have to act before something happens , " christian socialist defense expert christian schmidt told bild newspaper . embarrassing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder does n't always have so much company on vip flights germany 's business community is n't keen on the vip fleet either .
on a return trip from asia last year , schröder found himself in a half-full plane .
many of the top german managers in the chancellor 's entourage , including siemens ceo heinrich von pierer and then german industry association chief michael rogowski , chose to fly home with lufthansa rather then hitch a ride with schröder . von pierer has called the state planes unacceptable , while another manager complained that one of the toilet doors did n't close properly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german government plane but experts in the defense ministry , which is responsible for the vip fleet , have said that there 's currently no need to replace the planes , according to die welt daily .
the fleet is in a " technically good to very good condition , " the ministry said in a report . still , schröder is said to have asked frequent flyer fischer and struck - notorious for his tight hold on his ministry 's purse strings - to get together and discuss the matter . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus jumbo readies for take off some 5,000 guests will be among the first to cast their eyes on the world 's largest airliner , when airbus rolls out the a380 in a lavish ceremony in toulouse , france , on tuesday .

" what more has to happen before the vip squadron gets new planes ? " he asked at a cabinet meeting shortly after being subjected to an emergency landing of one of the state 's challenger jets when the plane started smoking .
" will i have to be laid out in a coffin in the foreign ministry 's world hall first ? "
der spiegel weekly quoted the diplomat as saying . admittedly , germany 's vip fleet - in the service of the president , chancellor , cabinet , parliamentary and party leaders - is getting a bit long in the tooth .
the six " challenger " small- and mid-range jets have been flying for nearly 20 years and the seven airbus a310s are only slightly younger .
three of them were inherited from east germany 's state airlines in 1990 and the others were second-hand purchases from lufthansa around the same time . pariah planes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " challenger " jet , such as the one fischer was in that had to make an emergency landing but fischer is n't the only one unhappy with the old planes .
chancellor gerhard schröder and defense minister peter struck are well acquainted with the fleet 's weaknesses .
when the plane he was set to fly on was revealed to be defect , the chancellor recently snapped up the jet struck had booked right out from under the minister 's feet .
struck had to wait a long time for a military transporter to finally pick him up , according to der spiegel . and it 's not just government members who would rather shun the planes .
opposition cdu politician volker rühe , head of parliament 's foreign policy committee last week said the vip squadron had apparently reached the limits and alternatives , such as leasing new planes , should be examined .
" we have to act before something happens , " christian socialist defense expert christian schmidt told bild newspaper . embarrassing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder does n't always have so much company on vip flights germany 's business community is n't keen on the vip fleet either .
on a return trip from asia last year , schröder found himself in a half-full plane .
many of the top german managers in the chancellor 's entourage , including siemens ceo heinrich von pierer and then german industry association chief michael rogowski , chose to fly home with lufthansa rather then hitch a ride with schröder . von pierer has called the state planes unacceptable , while another manager complained that one of the toilet doors did n't close properly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german government plane but experts in the defense ministry , which is responsible for the vip fleet , have said that there 's currently no need to replace the planes , according to die welt daily .
the fleet is in a " technically good to very good condition , " the ministry said in a report . still , schröder is said to have asked frequent flyer fischer and struck - notorious for his tight hold on his ministry 's purse strings - to get together and discuss the matter . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus jumbo readies for take off some 5,000 guests will be among the first to cast their eyes on the world 's largest airliner , when airbus rolls out the a380 in a lavish ceremony in toulouse , france , on tuesday .

" if you did n't know him , you missed something , you missed someone , " he said tearfully of the 50-year-old producer , who committed suicide earlier in the day . european skew kosslick , who has headed up the 11-day festival since 2002 , has made european cinema the main focus of this year 's berlinale , where 14 of the 22 films competing for the top golden and silver bear awards are from europe . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlinale film festival jury headed by roland emmerich the seven-person jury is headed by " independence day " director roland emmerich , and includes chinese actress bai ling , ukrainian writer and cinematographer andrei kurkov and , in a paean to the fashion industry , italian designer nino cerruti .
they will announce the winners of the coveted awards on feb .
19 . at the opening ceremony , berlin mayor klaus wowereit made an impassioned plea for more public money for cinema , with culture programs in economically-stagnant germany often the first on the chopping block . the " people 's " festival seventeen of the films in competition will screen for the first time in the german capital , and six of those are from first-time feature directors .
organizers are emphasizing the openness of the festival , where tickets cost an average of € 7 -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- and can often be obtained up until half an hour before the curtain goes up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from competing film " one day in europe " by director hannes stöhr jostling for the golden bear for best film are family drama " kong que " -lrb- " peacock " -rrb- by china 's gu chang wei -lrb- " farewell my concubine " -rrb- , a japanese sword-fighting love story " kakushi ken - oni no tsume " -lrb- " the hidden blade " -rrb- , and a german-spanish crime caper on soccer obsession called " one day in europe . " four french films are also in the running and france lent a hand to three other productions .
germany , which walked away with the golden bear last year for the gripping cross-cultural relationship drama " gegen die wand " -lrb- " head-on " -rrb- , is represented with three films and one co-production , and the united states has three films in the running . dw staff / afp -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlinale joins european big three it may not have the cachet of cannes or the star quality of sundance , but the berlinale is one of the most important dates on the film industry 's calendar , thanks in part to its own trade fair , the european film market .

the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .
struck called the project " essential for germany 's image in nato , but also with respect to its relationship with the usa . "

the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .

in the 14-story assembly hall , ten men in white overalls are screwing nuts onto a huge white barrel five and a half meters in diameters and as high as three wardrobes stacked on top of each other .
the barrel is the highest part of the rocket , which was built in the northern german city of bremen , to carry satellites into orbit .
a heavy-weight transporter steven kubacki is one of the technicians at eads space , working to assemble , or " integrate , " as the experts say , the new ariane 5 eca .
piece by piece it grows upwards complete with jets , towering fuel tanks , and boosters . the world will be watching the blast-off with baited breath , remembering the fated first attempt back in december 2002 when the control center had to blow the rocket up , causing € 130 million -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- to come shattering back down to earth in shards . horst holsten , known to his colleagues at eads as " mr ariane , " said the error , which was traced back to the engine , has been eliminated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst holsten of eads space he has been involved in the development of all the ariane rockets from the first prototype which dates back 26 years to the newest ariane 5 eca .
he started out as an engineer , but went on to become team leader , and after many years as head of the carrier rocket department , he is now coming up for retirement . but before that happens , holsten wants to see the new eca soar up through the skies , carrying 10 tons of cargo - 67 percent more weight than its predecessor . " as soon as the moment for blast-off arrives , as soon as the rocket has been launched , there is nothing more we can do from the ground , " he said .
" as soon as it is gone , we can only hope there is nothing we have forgotten . " testing the skies the ariane expert is not the only one who is hoping that nothing gets forgotten .
operators of the xtar satellite which will be the main cargo on this virgin flight , have their fingers firmly crossed . in order to test whether the ariane 5 eca is really as strong as the engineers have calculated , they will also be sending some dead freight laden with measuring equipment . if everything goes according to plan the technicians will turn their attention to their next goal of expanding the cargo capability of the rocket to 12 tons .
but with the boom in the telecommunications market and the demand in transport for large expensive satellites over , it is far from clear whether such a successor model will ever actually be built . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa hails huygens , plans new missions one week after the european space probe huygens successfully landed on saturn 's moon titan , the european space agency released more details and revealed future plans .

finalists in seven of the 17 world cups since the inaugural tournament in uruguay all the way back in 1930 , germany have been champions three times and have graced the final , although unsuccessfully , a further four times .
germany 's record in world cup finals speaks for itself but many of the team 's greatest achievements have come in other games within the tournament .
while in some cases germany 's route to the world cup has been little more than effective , the team has always risen to the challenge of the big stage once qualification has been achieved .

critics say minister joschka fischer treats diplomats who were once members of the nazi party shabbily . since 2003 , the internal foreign ministry newsletter has ceased to print obituaries for former members of the nazi party .
foreign minister fischer demanded the exception be made to the practice of commemorating deceased ministry workers in the circular , according to german papers . former ambassador to japan franz krapf died in october , but not a word about his death has appeared in the " internaa " newsletter .
a slew of high-ranking foreign diplomats made good for the omission by publishing a large-format death notice for their late colleague in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on wednesday . one of krapf 's disgruntled colleagues , former foreign ministry state secretary werner hoyer , called fischer 's instructions an " undignified incident and a sign of misunderstood political correctness . " krapf was not merely a nazi party member but also in the ss .
after world war ii , however , he was deemed fit to work in the foreign service and started his career there in 1951 . generation gap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new wind blows in joschka fischer 's foreign ministry " the atmosphere has changed since the 1980s , " was the foreign ministry 's comment on the new practice . younger diplomats have called it a relief that someone finally took a critical approach to the subject .
they referred to the recent commemoration of former ministry worker fritz kolbe , who was allegedly viewed for years as a traitor for passing some 1,600 secret documents to the us between 1943 and 1945 .
in 1951 , his application to re-join the foreign ministry ranks was rejected . " for many of the old and new civil servants in the foreign ministry , fritz kolbe 's cooperation with the allies was treason , " fischer said in the autumn in a speech honoring kolbe , during which a lecture hall in the foreign ministry was named after him .
" at the same time , especially for those of his colleagues in the higher levels who had come to terms with the nazi regime and did n't show the courage to resist , kolbe , the low-ranking consulate secretary , was always a living reproach . " some critics , however , have alleged that fischer is applying a double-standard , pointing to joscha schmierer 's appointment to the foreign ministry 's planning staff .
until 1983 , schmierer was a member , and for some time even a leader , of the kbw , a west german communist party .
in his defense , fischer argued that , in the ensuing 20 years , schmierer had changed his outlook . fischer himself has faced angry opposition from conservative politicians in the past over his own background as a member of a militant left-wing group in frankfurt from 1968 to 1975 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

world cup final , 1966 : england vs. west germany england and germany came together in london for the final of the 1966 world cup , creating one of the most memorable games in the tournament 's history and one of the most enduring rivalries in the sport .
world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .
first they had to overcome reigning european champs italy .
world cup final , 1974 : west germany vs. the netherlands hosts germany struggled through the early stages in the 1974 world cup but had picked up speed by the time they met the netherlands in the final .

the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .
struck called the project " essential for germany 's image in nato , but also with respect to its relationship with the usa . "

critics say minister joschka fischer treats diplomats who were once members of the nazi party shabbily . since 2003 , the internal foreign ministry newsletter has ceased to print obituaries for former members of the nazi party .
foreign minister fischer demanded the exception be made to the practice of commemorating deceased ministry workers in the circular , according to german papers . former ambassador to japan franz krapf died in october , but not a word about his death has appeared in the " internaa " newsletter .
a slew of high-ranking foreign diplomats made good for the omission by publishing a large-format death notice for their late colleague in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on wednesday . one of krapf 's disgruntled colleagues , former foreign ministry state secretary werner hoyer , called fischer 's instructions an " undignified incident and a sign of misunderstood political correctness . " krapf was not merely a nazi party member but also in the ss .
after world war ii , however , he was deemed fit to work in the foreign service and started his career there in 1951 . generation gap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new wind blows in joschka fischer 's foreign ministry " the atmosphere has changed since the 1980s , " was the foreign ministry 's comment on the new practice . younger diplomats have called it a relief that someone finally took a critical approach to the subject .
they referred to the recent commemoration of former ministry worker fritz kolbe , who was allegedly viewed for years as a traitor for passing some 1,600 secret documents to the us between 1943 and 1945 .
in 1951 , his application to re-join the foreign ministry ranks was rejected . " for many of the old and new civil servants in the foreign ministry , fritz kolbe 's cooperation with the allies was treason , " fischer said in the autumn in a speech honoring kolbe , during which a lecture hall in the foreign ministry was named after him .
" at the same time , especially for those of his colleagues in the higher levels who had come to terms with the nazi regime and did n't show the courage to resist , kolbe , the low-ranking consulate secretary , was always a living reproach . " some critics , however , have alleged that fischer is applying a double-standard , pointing to joscha schmierer 's appointment to the foreign ministry 's planning staff .
until 1983 , schmierer was a member , and for some time even a leader , of the kbw , a west german communist party .
in his defense , fischer argued that , in the ensuing 20 years , schmierer had changed his outlook . fischer himself has faced angry opposition from conservative politicians in the past over his own background as a member of a militant left-wing group in frankfurt from 1968 to 1975 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

finalists in seven of the 17 world cups since the inaugural tournament in uruguay all the way back in 1930 , germany have been champions three times and have graced the final , although unsuccessfully , a further four times .
germany 's record in world cup finals speaks for itself but many of the team 's greatest achievements have come in other games within the tournament .
while in some cases germany 's route to the world cup has been little more than effective , the team has always risen to the challenge of the big stage once qualification has been achieved .
throughout the competitions history , the germans have been involved in some of the world cup 's most memorable games when it really mattered . here , dw-world recounts five of germany 's most exciting contests from the team 's long association with the greatest prize in international soccer . dw-world.de world cup final , 1954 : hungary vs. west germany germany became world champions for the first time in switzerland in 1954 in a fairytale final that started the german world cup legend .
world cup final , 1966 : england vs. west germany england and germany came together in london for the final of the 1966 world cup , creating one of the most memorable games in the tournament 's history and one of the most enduring rivalries in the sport .
world cup semi-final , 1970 : italy vs. west germany germany were looking for world cup glory after the disappointment of 1966 .
first they had to overcome reigning european champs italy .
world cup final , 1974 : west germany vs. the netherlands hosts germany struggled through the early stages in the 1974 world cup but had picked up speed by the time they met the netherlands in the final .
it would be a contest of total discipline versus total football .
world cup semi-final , 1982 : west germany vs. france the finals in spain played host to the clash between teutonic efficiency and french élan as germany met france in the hugely anticipated semi-final in seville .

in the 14-story assembly hall , ten men in white overalls are screwing nuts onto a huge white barrel five and a half meters in diameters and as high as three wardrobes stacked on top of each other .
the barrel is the highest part of the rocket , which was built in the northern german city of bremen , to carry satellites into orbit .
a heavy-weight transporter steven kubacki is one of the technicians at eads space , working to assemble , or " integrate , " as the experts say , the new ariane 5 eca .
piece by piece it grows upwards complete with jets , towering fuel tanks , and boosters . the world will be watching the blast-off with baited breath , remembering the fated first attempt back in december 2002 when the control center had to blow the rocket up , causing € 130 million -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- to come shattering back down to earth in shards . horst holsten , known to his colleagues at eads as " mr ariane , " said the error , which was traced back to the engine , has been eliminated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst holsten of eads space he has been involved in the development of all the ariane rockets from the first prototype which dates back 26 years to the newest ariane 5 eca .
he started out as an engineer , but went on to become team leader , and after many years as head of the carrier rocket department , he is now coming up for retirement . but before that happens , holsten wants to see the new eca soar up through the skies , carrying 10 tons of cargo - 67 percent more weight than its predecessor . " as soon as the moment for blast-off arrives , as soon as the rocket has been launched , there is nothing more we can do from the ground , " he said .
" as soon as it is gone , we can only hope there is nothing we have forgotten . " testing the skies the ariane expert is not the only one who is hoping that nothing gets forgotten .
operators of the xtar satellite which will be the main cargo on this virgin flight , have their fingers firmly crossed . in order to test whether the ariane 5 eca is really as strong as the engineers have calculated , they will also be sending some dead freight laden with measuring equipment . if everything goes according to plan the technicians will turn their attention to their next goal of expanding the cargo capability of the rocket to 12 tons .
but with the boom in the telecommunications market and the demand in transport for large expensive satellites over , it is far from clear whether such a successor model will ever actually be built . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa hails huygens , plans new missions one week after the european space probe huygens successfully landed on saturn 's moon titan , the european space agency released more details and revealed future plans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.02.2005 fischer snubs ex-nazi diplomats großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many nazis remained in the german foreign ministry after 1945 the german foreign ministry has invoked the ire of a who 's who of former german diplomats .
critics say minister joschka fischer treats diplomats who were once members of the nazi party shabbily . since 2003 , the internal foreign ministry newsletter has ceased to print obituaries for former members of the nazi party .
foreign minister fischer demanded the exception be made to the practice of commemorating deceased ministry workers in the circular , according to german papers . former ambassador to japan franz krapf died in october , but not a word about his death has appeared in the " internaa " newsletter .
a slew of high-ranking foreign diplomats made good for the omission by publishing a large-format death notice for their late colleague in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on wednesday . one of krapf 's disgruntled colleagues , former foreign ministry state secretary werner hoyer , called fischer 's instructions an " undignified incident and a sign of misunderstood political correctness . " krapf was not merely a nazi party member but also in the ss .
after world war ii , however , he was deemed fit to work in the foreign service and started his career there in 1951 . generation gap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new wind blows in joschka fischer 's foreign ministry " the atmosphere has changed since the 1980s , " was the foreign ministry 's comment on the new practice . younger diplomats have called it a relief that someone finally took a critical approach to the subject .
they referred to the recent commemoration of former ministry worker fritz kolbe , who was allegedly viewed for years as a traitor for passing some 1,600 secret documents to the us between 1943 and 1945 .
in 1951 , his application to re-join the foreign ministry ranks was rejected . " for many of the old and new civil servants in the foreign ministry , fritz kolbe 's cooperation with the allies was treason , " fischer said in the autumn in a speech honoring kolbe , during which a lecture hall in the foreign ministry was named after him .
" at the same time , especially for those of his colleagues in the higher levels who had come to terms with the nazi regime and did n't show the courage to resist , kolbe , the low-ranking consulate secretary , was always a living reproach . " some critics , however , have alleged that fischer is applying a double-standard , pointing to joscha schmierer 's appointment to the foreign ministry 's planning staff .
until 1983 , schmierer was a member , and for some time even a leader , of the kbw , a west german communist party .
in his defense , fischer argued that , in the ensuing 20 years , schmierer had changed his outlook . fischer himself has faced angry opposition from conservative politicians in the past over his own background as a member of a militant left-wing group in frankfurt from 1968 to 1975 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

reiterating his hopes for peace in aceh , which has been in the grip of a separatist rebellion since 1976 , fischer emphasized that solving the violent conflict was crucial to ensure aceh remains open to foreign aid and for reconstruction to begin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.02.2005 germany mulls us arms partnership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's other big-budget air force project : the a400 german politicians are discussing the need to build a missile defense system against enemies that germany does n't have and with money it needs elsewhere .
the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .
struck called the project " essential for germany 's image in nato , but also with respect to its relationship with the usa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder sits in the cockpit of a new multi-role military helicopter nh 90 at the opening day of the international aerospace exibition in berlin monday , may 10 , 2004 .
the finance ministry is wondering at what price .
experts like kubbig assume that the project will cost from three to four times current estimates .
the ministry 's military allowance is already maxed out with projects like the eu-developed eurofighter , the airbus 400 transport plane and the new nh 90 helicopter -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a decision will have to be made soon .

the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .

critics say minister joschka fischer treats diplomats who were once members of the nazi party shabbily . since 2003 , the internal foreign ministry newsletter has ceased to print obituaries for former members of the nazi party .
foreign minister fischer demanded the exception be made to the practice of commemorating deceased ministry workers in the circular , according to german papers . former ambassador to japan franz krapf died in october , but not a word about his death has appeared in the " internaa " newsletter .
a slew of high-ranking foreign diplomats made good for the omission by publishing a large-format death notice for their late colleague in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on wednesday . one of krapf 's disgruntled colleagues , former foreign ministry state secretary werner hoyer , called fischer 's instructions an " undignified incident and a sign of misunderstood political correctness . " krapf was not merely a nazi party member but also in the ss .
after world war ii , however , he was deemed fit to work in the foreign service and started his career there in 1951 . generation gap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new wind blows in joschka fischer 's foreign ministry " the atmosphere has changed since the 1980s , " was the foreign ministry 's comment on the new practice . younger diplomats have called it a relief that someone finally took a critical approach to the subject .
they referred to the recent commemoration of former ministry worker fritz kolbe , who was allegedly viewed for years as a traitor for passing some 1,600 secret documents to the us between 1943 and 1945 .
in 1951 , his application to re-join the foreign ministry ranks was rejected . " for many of the old and new civil servants in the foreign ministry , fritz kolbe 's cooperation with the allies was treason , " fischer said in the autumn in a speech honoring kolbe , during which a lecture hall in the foreign ministry was named after him .
" at the same time , especially for those of his colleagues in the higher levels who had come to terms with the nazi regime and did n't show the courage to resist , kolbe , the low-ranking consulate secretary , was always a living reproach . " some critics , however , have alleged that fischer is applying a double-standard , pointing to joscha schmierer 's appointment to the foreign ministry 's planning staff .
until 1983 , schmierer was a member , and for some time even a leader , of the kbw , a west german communist party .
in his defense , fischer argued that , in the ensuing 20 years , schmierer had changed his outlook . fischer himself has faced angry opposition from conservative politicians in the past over his own background as a member of a militant left-wing group in frankfurt from 1968 to 1975 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

" as soon as it is gone , we can only hope there is nothing we have forgotten . " testing the skies the ariane expert is not the only one who is hoping that nothing gets forgotten .
operators of the xtar satellite which will be the main cargo on this virgin flight , have their fingers firmly crossed . in order to test whether the ariane 5 eca is really as strong as the engineers have calculated , they will also be sending some dead freight laden with measuring equipment . if everything goes according to plan the technicians will turn their attention to their next goal of expanding the cargo capability of the rocket to 12 tons .

his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "

the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.02.2005 germany mulls us arms partnership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's other big-budget air force project : the a400 german politicians are discussing the need to build a missile defense system against enemies that germany does n't have and with money it needs elsewhere .
the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .
struck called the project " essential for germany 's image in nato , but also with respect to its relationship with the usa . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schroeder sits in the cockpit of a new multi-role military helicopter nh 90 at the opening day of the international aerospace exibition in berlin monday , may 10 , 2004 .
the finance ministry is wondering at what price .
experts like kubbig assume that the project will cost from three to four times current estimates .
the ministry 's military allowance is already maxed out with projects like the eu-developed eurofighter , the airbus 400 transport plane and the new nh 90 helicopter -lrb- photo -rrb- .
a decision will have to be made soon .
deadline for germany to sign the contract is the end of march .

in the 14-story assembly hall , ten men in white overalls are screwing nuts onto a huge white barrel five and a half meters in diameters and as high as three wardrobes stacked on top of each other .
the barrel is the highest part of the rocket , which was built in the northern german city of bremen , to carry satellites into orbit .
a heavy-weight transporter steven kubacki is one of the technicians at eads space , working to assemble , or " integrate , " as the experts say , the new ariane 5 eca .
piece by piece it grows upwards complete with jets , towering fuel tanks , and boosters . the world will be watching the blast-off with baited breath , remembering the fated first attempt back in december 2002 when the control center had to blow the rocket up , causing € 130 million -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- to come shattering back down to earth in shards . horst holsten , known to his colleagues at eads as " mr ariane , " said the error , which was traced back to the engine , has been eliminated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst holsten of eads space he has been involved in the development of all the ariane rockets from the first prototype which dates back 26 years to the newest ariane 5 eca .
he started out as an engineer , but went on to become team leader , and after many years as head of the carrier rocket department , he is now coming up for retirement . but before that happens , holsten wants to see the new eca soar up through the skies , carrying 10 tons of cargo - 67 percent more weight than its predecessor . " as soon as the moment for blast-off arrives , as soon as the rocket has been launched , there is nothing more we can do from the ground , " he said .
" as soon as it is gone , we can only hope there is nothing we have forgotten . " testing the skies the ariane expert is not the only one who is hoping that nothing gets forgotten .
operators of the xtar satellite which will be the main cargo on this virgin flight , have their fingers firmly crossed . in order to test whether the ariane 5 eca is really as strong as the engineers have calculated , they will also be sending some dead freight laden with measuring equipment . if everything goes according to plan the technicians will turn their attention to their next goal of expanding the cargo capability of the rocket to 12 tons .
but with the boom in the telecommunications market and the demand in transport for large expensive satellites over , it is far from clear whether such a successor model will ever actually be built . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa hails huygens , plans new missions one week after the european space probe huygens successfully landed on saturn 's moon titan , the european space agency released more details and revealed future plans .

der spiegel weekly quoted the diplomat as saying . admittedly , germany 's vip fleet - in the service of the president , chancellor , cabinet , parliamentary and party leaders - is getting a bit long in the tooth .
the six " challenger " small- and mid-range jets have been flying for nearly 20 years and the seven airbus a310s are only slightly younger .

struck had to wait a long time for a military transporter to finally pick him up , according to der spiegel . and it 's not just government members who would rather shun the planes .
opposition cdu politician volker rühe , head of parliament 's foreign policy committee last week said the vip squadron had apparently reached the limits and alternatives , such as leasing new planes , should be examined .

the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .
struck called the project " essential for germany 's image in nato , but also with respect to its relationship with the usa . "

but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .

his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .

in the 14-story assembly hall , ten men in white overalls are screwing nuts onto a huge white barrel five and a half meters in diameters and as high as three wardrobes stacked on top of each other .
the barrel is the highest part of the rocket , which was built in the northern german city of bremen , to carry satellites into orbit .
a heavy-weight transporter steven kubacki is one of the technicians at eads space , working to assemble , or " integrate , " as the experts say , the new ariane 5 eca .
piece by piece it grows upwards complete with jets , towering fuel tanks , and boosters . the world will be watching the blast-off with baited breath , remembering the fated first attempt back in december 2002 when the control center had to blow the rocket up , causing € 130 million -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- to come shattering back down to earth in shards . horst holsten , known to his colleagues at eads as " mr ariane , " said the error , which was traced back to the engine , has been eliminated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst holsten of eads space he has been involved in the development of all the ariane rockets from the first prototype which dates back 26 years to the newest ariane 5 eca .
he started out as an engineer , but went on to become team leader , and after many years as head of the carrier rocket department , he is now coming up for retirement . but before that happens , holsten wants to see the new eca soar up through the skies , carrying 10 tons of cargo - 67 percent more weight than its predecessor . " as soon as the moment for blast-off arrives , as soon as the rocket has been launched , there is nothing more we can do from the ground , " he said .
" as soon as it is gone , we can only hope there is nothing we have forgotten . " testing the skies the ariane expert is not the only one who is hoping that nothing gets forgotten .
operators of the xtar satellite which will be the main cargo on this virgin flight , have their fingers firmly crossed . in order to test whether the ariane 5 eca is really as strong as the engineers have calculated , they will also be sending some dead freight laden with measuring equipment . if everything goes according to plan the technicians will turn their attention to their next goal of expanding the cargo capability of the rocket to 12 tons .
but with the boom in the telecommunications market and the demand in transport for large expensive satellites over , it is far from clear whether such a successor model will ever actually be built . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa hails huygens , plans new missions one week after the european space probe huygens successfully landed on saturn 's moon titan , the european space agency released more details and revealed future plans .

" what more has to happen before the vip squadron gets new planes ? " he asked at a cabinet meeting shortly after being subjected to an emergency landing of one of the state 's challenger jets when the plane started smoking .
" will i have to be laid out in a coffin in the foreign ministry 's world hall first ? "
der spiegel weekly quoted the diplomat as saying . admittedly , germany 's vip fleet - in the service of the president , chancellor , cabinet , parliamentary and party leaders - is getting a bit long in the tooth .
the six " challenger " small- and mid-range jets have been flying for nearly 20 years and the seven airbus a310s are only slightly younger .
three of them were inherited from east germany 's state airlines in 1990 and the others were second-hand purchases from lufthansa around the same time . pariah planes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " challenger " jet , such as the one fischer was in that had to make an emergency landing but fischer is n't the only one unhappy with the old planes .
chancellor gerhard schröder and defense minister peter struck are well acquainted with the fleet 's weaknesses .
when the plane he was set to fly on was revealed to be defect , the chancellor recently snapped up the jet struck had booked right out from under the minister 's feet .
struck had to wait a long time for a military transporter to finally pick him up , according to der spiegel . and it 's not just government members who would rather shun the planes .
opposition cdu politician volker rühe , head of parliament 's foreign policy committee last week said the vip squadron had apparently reached the limits and alternatives , such as leasing new planes , should be examined .
" we have to act before something happens , " christian socialist defense expert christian schmidt told bild newspaper . embarrassing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder does n't always have so much company on vip flights germany 's business community is n't keen on the vip fleet either .
on a return trip from asia last year , schröder found himself in a half-full plane .
many of the top german managers in the chancellor 's entourage , including siemens ceo heinrich von pierer and then german industry association chief michael rogowski , chose to fly home with lufthansa rather then hitch a ride with schröder . von pierer has called the state planes unacceptable , while another manager complained that one of the toilet doors did n't close properly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german government plane but experts in the defense ministry , which is responsible for the vip fleet , have said that there 's currently no need to replace the planes , according to die welt daily .
the fleet is in a " technically good to very good condition , " the ministry said in a report . still , schröder is said to have asked frequent flyer fischer and struck - notorious for his tight hold on his ministry 's purse strings - to get together and discuss the matter . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de airbus jumbo readies for take off some 5,000 guests will be among the first to cast their eyes on the world 's largest airliner , when airbus rolls out the a380 in a lavish ceremony in toulouse , france , on tuesday .

critics say minister joschka fischer treats diplomats who were once members of the nazi party shabbily . since 2003 , the internal foreign ministry newsletter has ceased to print obituaries for former members of the nazi party .
foreign minister fischer demanded the exception be made to the practice of commemorating deceased ministry workers in the circular , according to german papers . former ambassador to japan franz krapf died in october , but not a word about his death has appeared in the " internaa " newsletter .
a slew of high-ranking foreign diplomats made good for the omission by publishing a large-format death notice for their late colleague in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on wednesday . one of krapf 's disgruntled colleagues , former foreign ministry state secretary werner hoyer , called fischer 's instructions an " undignified incident and a sign of misunderstood political correctness . " krapf was not merely a nazi party member but also in the ss .
after world war ii , however , he was deemed fit to work in the foreign service and started his career there in 1951 . generation gap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new wind blows in joschka fischer 's foreign ministry " the atmosphere has changed since the 1980s , " was the foreign ministry 's comment on the new practice . younger diplomats have called it a relief that someone finally took a critical approach to the subject .
they referred to the recent commemoration of former ministry worker fritz kolbe , who was allegedly viewed for years as a traitor for passing some 1,600 secret documents to the us between 1943 and 1945 .
in 1951 , his application to re-join the foreign ministry ranks was rejected . " for many of the old and new civil servants in the foreign ministry , fritz kolbe 's cooperation with the allies was treason , " fischer said in the autumn in a speech honoring kolbe , during which a lecture hall in the foreign ministry was named after him .
" at the same time , especially for those of his colleagues in the higher levels who had come to terms with the nazi regime and did n't show the courage to resist , kolbe , the low-ranking consulate secretary , was always a living reproach . " some critics , however , have alleged that fischer is applying a double-standard , pointing to joscha schmierer 's appointment to the foreign ministry 's planning staff .
until 1983 , schmierer was a member , and for some time even a leader , of the kbw , a west german communist party .
in his defense , fischer argued that , in the ensuing 20 years , schmierer had changed his outlook . fischer himself has faced angry opposition from conservative politicians in the past over his own background as a member of a militant left-wing group in frankfurt from 1968 to 1975 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

the barrel is the highest part of the rocket , which was built in the northern german city of bremen , to carry satellites into orbit .

he started out as an engineer , but went on to become team leader , and after many years as head of the carrier rocket department , he is now coming up for retirement . but before that happens , holsten wants to see the new eca soar up through the skies , carrying 10 tons of cargo - 67 percent more weight than its predecessor . " as soon as the moment for blast-off arrives , as soon as the rocket has been launched , there is nothing more we can do from the ground , " he said .
" as soon as it is gone , we can only hope there is nothing we have forgotten . " testing the skies the ariane expert is not the only one who is hoping that nothing gets forgotten .
operators of the xtar satellite which will be the main cargo on this virgin flight , have their fingers firmly crossed . in order to test whether the ariane 5 eca is really as strong as the engineers have calculated , they will also be sending some dead freight laden with measuring equipment . if everything goes according to plan the technicians will turn their attention to their next goal of expanding the cargo capability of the rocket to 12 tons .

organizers are emphasizing the openness of the festival , where tickets cost an average of € 7 -lrb- $ 9 -rrb- and can often be obtained up until half an hour before the curtain goes up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from competing film " one day in europe " by director hannes stöhr jostling for the golden bear for best film are family drama " kong que " -lrb- " peacock " -rrb- by china 's gu chang wei -lrb- " farewell my concubine " -rrb- , a japanese sword-fighting love story " kakushi ken - oni no tsume " -lrb- " the hidden blade " -rrb- , and a german-spanish crime caper on soccer obsession called " one day in europe .

in the 14-story assembly hall , ten men in white overalls are screwing nuts onto a huge white barrel five and a half meters in diameters and as high as three wardrobes stacked on top of each other .
the barrel is the highest part of the rocket , which was built in the northern german city of bremen , to carry satellites into orbit .
a heavy-weight transporter steven kubacki is one of the technicians at eads space , working to assemble , or " integrate , " as the experts say , the new ariane 5 eca .
piece by piece it grows upwards complete with jets , towering fuel tanks , and boosters . the world will be watching the blast-off with baited breath , remembering the fated first attempt back in december 2002 when the control center had to blow the rocket up , causing € 130 million -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- to come shattering back down to earth in shards . horst holsten , known to his colleagues at eads as " mr ariane , " said the error , which was traced back to the engine , has been eliminated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst holsten of eads space he has been involved in the development of all the ariane rockets from the first prototype which dates back 26 years to the newest ariane 5 eca .
he started out as an engineer , but went on to become team leader , and after many years as head of the carrier rocket department , he is now coming up for retirement . but before that happens , holsten wants to see the new eca soar up through the skies , carrying 10 tons of cargo - 67 percent more weight than its predecessor . " as soon as the moment for blast-off arrives , as soon as the rocket has been launched , there is nothing more we can do from the ground , " he said .
" as soon as it is gone , we can only hope there is nothing we have forgotten . " testing the skies the ariane expert is not the only one who is hoping that nothing gets forgotten .
operators of the xtar satellite which will be the main cargo on this virgin flight , have their fingers firmly crossed . in order to test whether the ariane 5 eca is really as strong as the engineers have calculated , they will also be sending some dead freight laden with measuring equipment . if everything goes according to plan the technicians will turn their attention to their next goal of expanding the cargo capability of the rocket to 12 tons .
but with the boom in the telecommunications market and the demand in transport for large expensive satellites over , it is far from clear whether such a successor model will ever actually be built . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa hails huygens , plans new missions one week after the european space probe huygens successfully landed on saturn 's moon titan , the european space agency released more details and revealed future plans .

in the 14-story assembly hall , ten men in white overalls are screwing nuts onto a huge white barrel five and a half meters in diameters and as high as three wardrobes stacked on top of each other .
the barrel is the highest part of the rocket , which was built in the northern german city of bremen , to carry satellites into orbit .
a heavy-weight transporter steven kubacki is one of the technicians at eads space , working to assemble , or " integrate , " as the experts say , the new ariane 5 eca .
piece by piece it grows upwards complete with jets , towering fuel tanks , and boosters . the world will be watching the blast-off with baited breath , remembering the fated first attempt back in december 2002 when the control center had to blow the rocket up , causing € 130 million -lrb- $ 167 million -rrb- to come shattering back down to earth in shards . horst holsten , known to his colleagues at eads as " mr ariane , " said the error , which was traced back to the engine , has been eliminated . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst holsten of eads space he has been involved in the development of all the ariane rockets from the first prototype which dates back 26 years to the newest ariane 5 eca .
he started out as an engineer , but went on to become team leader , and after many years as head of the carrier rocket department , he is now coming up for retirement . but before that happens , holsten wants to see the new eca soar up through the skies , carrying 10 tons of cargo - 67 percent more weight than its predecessor . " as soon as the moment for blast-off arrives , as soon as the rocket has been launched , there is nothing more we can do from the ground , " he said .
" as soon as it is gone , we can only hope there is nothing we have forgotten . " testing the skies the ariane expert is not the only one who is hoping that nothing gets forgotten .
operators of the xtar satellite which will be the main cargo on this virgin flight , have their fingers firmly crossed . in order to test whether the ariane 5 eca is really as strong as the engineers have calculated , they will also be sending some dead freight laden with measuring equipment . if everything goes according to plan the technicians will turn their attention to their next goal of expanding the cargo capability of the rocket to 12 tons .
but with the boom in the telecommunications market and the demand in transport for large expensive satellites over , it is far from clear whether such a successor model will ever actually be built . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de esa hails huygens , plans new missions one week after the european space probe huygens successfully landed on saturn 's moon titan , the european space agency released more details and revealed future plans .

" the german economy grew by 1.7 percent last year , primarily as a result of exports , " rato told the daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung in an interview .
" business sentiment appears to have improved a little and there are signs of a recovery in domestic demand .
nevertheless , we expect growth to slow to 1.0-1.5 percent . "
that is slower than the government 's official growth forecast of 1.6 percent this year .
rato urged the euro zone 's biggest economy to press ahead with reforms to help boost growth .
" the social security net has long become a trap , " he said .
" if this does n't change and there are no further reforms , the growth potential of the german economy , which is currently no more than 1.5-1.9 percent , will sink further .
in germany , as in other european countries , more people will have to work and employees will have to work a little longer than they do at present . " dw-world.de economists , industry pin hopes on 2005 after several years of stagnation , the german economy has begun showing signs of life and some economists and industry leaders say they are cautiously optimistic about 2005 .
others say germany ’ s not out of the woods yet .

bernhard docke told the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine that his client was " sexually stimulated in a helpless position " by " three women in lacy bras and panties " at the prison .
one of the women sat on his lap , while another rubbed her breasts against him .
when he managed to push one of the women away , he was beaten by guards , docke said .
detainees have previously complained of physical abuse and exposure to temperature extremes , but according to the washington post , pentagon officials have insisted that terrorists are trained to make false torture allegations .
the charges recall the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal .
pentagon officials have said that being scantily clad or touching and chatting with prisoners in a suggestive manner are inappropriate interrogation methods .
" i do n't see that as being authorized by the secretary of defense 's approved interrogation techniques for guantanamo , " colonel david mcwilliams , a spokesman for the miami-based us southern command , told the post .

pentagon officials have said that being scantily clad or touching and chatting with prisoners in a suggestive manner are inappropriate interrogation methods .
" i do n't see that as being authorized by the secretary of defense 's approved interrogation techniques for guantanamo , " colonel david mcwilliams , a spokesman for the miami-based us southern command , told the post .
he also said it was too early to comment on the allegations , as a military investigation of guantanamo - launched in january , after a group of fbi agents said they witnessed abuse - was still under way . dw-world.de europe criticizes treatment of prisoners in guantanamo bay a group of european parliament members has urged the european union to step up pressure on the u.s. to ensure fair treatment of guantanamo bay prisoners , in particular 20 eu citizens .

" what more has to happen before the vip squadron gets new planes ? " he asked at a cabinet meeting shortly after being subjected to an emergency landing of one of the state 's challenger jets when the plane started smoking .
" will i have to be laid out in a coffin in the foreign ministry 's world hall first ? "
der spiegel weekly quoted the diplomat as saying . admittedly , germany 's vip fleet - in the service of the president , chancellor , cabinet , parliamentary and party leaders - is getting a bit long in the tooth .
the six " challenger " small- and mid-range jets have been flying for nearly 20 years and the seven airbus a310s are only slightly younger .
three of them were inherited from east germany 's state airlines in 1990 and the others were second-hand purchases from lufthansa around the same time . pariah planes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a " challenger " jet , such as the one fischer was in that had to make an emergency landing but fischer is n't the only one unhappy with the old planes .
chancellor gerhard schröder and defense minister peter struck are well acquainted with the fleet 's weaknesses .
when the plane he was set to fly on was revealed to be defect , the chancellor recently snapped up the jet struck had booked right out from under the minister 's feet .
struck had to wait a long time for a military transporter to finally pick him up , according to der spiegel . and it 's not just government members who would rather shun the planes .
opposition cdu politician volker rühe , head of parliament 's foreign policy committee last week said the vip squadron had apparently reached the limits and alternatives , such as leasing new planes , should be examined .
" we have to act before something happens , " christian socialist defense expert christian schmidt told bild newspaper . embarrassing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder does n't always have so much company on vip flights germany 's business community is n't keen on the vip fleet either .
on a return trip from asia last year , schröder found himself in a half-full plane .
many of the top german managers in the chancellor 's entourage , including siemens ceo heinrich von pierer and then german industry association chief michael rogowski , chose to fly home with lufthansa rather then hitch a ride with schröder . von pierer has called the state planes unacceptable , while another manager complained that one of the toilet doors did n't close properly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german government plane but experts in the defense ministry , which is responsible for the vip fleet , have said that there 's currently no need to replace the planes , according to die welt daily .

critics say minister joschka fischer treats diplomats who were once members of the nazi party shabbily . since 2003 , the internal foreign ministry newsletter has ceased to print obituaries for former members of the nazi party .
foreign minister fischer demanded the exception be made to the practice of commemorating deceased ministry workers in the circular , according to german papers . former ambassador to japan franz krapf died in october , but not a word about his death has appeared in the " internaa " newsletter .
a slew of high-ranking foreign diplomats made good for the omission by publishing a large-format death notice for their late colleague in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper on wednesday . one of krapf 's disgruntled colleagues , former foreign ministry state secretary werner hoyer , called fischer 's instructions an " undignified incident and a sign of misunderstood political correctness . " krapf was not merely a nazi party member but also in the ss .
after world war ii , however , he was deemed fit to work in the foreign service and started his career there in 1951 . generation gap ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new wind blows in joschka fischer 's foreign ministry " the atmosphere has changed since the 1980s , " was the foreign ministry 's comment on the new practice . younger diplomats have called it a relief that someone finally took a critical approach to the subject .
they referred to the recent commemoration of former ministry worker fritz kolbe , who was allegedly viewed for years as a traitor for passing some 1,600 secret documents to the us between 1943 and 1945 .
in 1951 , his application to re-join the foreign ministry ranks was rejected . " for many of the old and new civil servants in the foreign ministry , fritz kolbe 's cooperation with the allies was treason , " fischer said in the autumn in a speech honoring kolbe , during which a lecture hall in the foreign ministry was named after him .
" at the same time , especially for those of his colleagues in the higher levels who had come to terms with the nazi regime and did n't show the courage to resist , kolbe , the low-ranking consulate secretary , was always a living reproach . " some critics , however , have alleged that fischer is applying a double-standard , pointing to joscha schmierer 's appointment to the foreign ministry 's planning staff .
until 1983 , schmierer was a member , and for some time even a leader , of the kbw , a west german communist party .
in his defense , fischer argued that , in the ensuing 20 years , schmierer had changed his outlook . fischer himself has faced angry opposition from conservative politicians in the past over his own background as a member of a militant left-wing group in frankfurt from 1968 to 1975 . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundestag wants to close visa loopholes are german diplomats too lax in issuing visas ?

in the 14-story assembly hall , ten men in white overalls are screwing nuts onto a huge white barrel five and a half meters in diameters and as high as three wardrobes stacked on top of each other .

the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .

the main reason : the us would be their main partner . the medium extended air defense system will guarantee that any foreign object - be it a plane , a missile or something else - launched toward germany from within 1,000 km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- of its borders will face an early demise .
the project , which has the full support of the german military , is spearheaded by american defense contractor lockheed martin and also has on board an italian defense contractor .
it is an opportunity for the german defense industry to once again get involved with a lucrative and high-profile project .
but the € 2.85 billion -lrb- $ 3.6 billion -rrb- it will cost for the german division of the european arms company eads to participate has raised some eyebrows in the german parliament .
green parliamentarian winfried nachtwei doubted " the military urgency " of the project .
his colleague hans christian ströbele , one of the parliament 's bedrock pacifists , said he " had the impression that the push to develop the system is n't really being made on military grounds . "
where 's the urgency ?
security expert bernd kubbig , who works for the frankfurt peace research institute , agreed .
though the danger of terrorism always lurks , germany has no known enemies within the 1,000 km range , he said .
like other security specialists he figures there are other motives behind the plan .
" one reason is that they want to make money available to the german armaments industry so that they can continue on , " said kubbig .
the second reason is that the german air force is eager to replace aging systems like " roland " and " hawk , " he said .
some politicians prefer to use the jobs argument , no small one at a time when germany 's growth rates are sputtering and where more than 10 percent of the population is unemployed .
jobs and friends " a good amount of the radar development will take place in germany , " said hans-peter bartels , a parliamentarian from chancellor schröder 's social democratic party .
german industry , he continued , would benefit from the project as would " possibly other areas . "
but perhaps the biggest reason may be germany 's eagerness to get back on washington 's good side .
after transatlantic relations froze over the iraq war , both sides have been working hard on improving ties .

he told a news conference in the northern city of kiel that he and justice minister brigitte zypries would present details of measures to prevent the march on friday .
they could then be fast-tracked before the planned far-right gathering in may .
schily said the government 's proposals would seek to ban protests at certain sites , notably those of a sensitive nature .
the far right-wing party npd plans to hold a rally on or around may 8 , the 60th anniversary of the end of world war two in europe , and aims to protest at the subsequent era of " liberation lies " and " the cult of guilt . "
mainstream parties have been divided in their response to the far right 's activities , but the neo-nazi 's plan to march past the soon-to-be-finished jewish memorial and sweep through brandenburg gate in may has spurred action .
the far right march in may is already a matter for the berlin city assembly , but it is unlikely to decide whether to ban it before late april .
the city could prevent it on security grounds , such as the proximity to the new us embassy currently under construction . dw-world.de dw-world : the struggle over dresden ’ s symbolism on sunday , dresden commemorates the 60th anniversary of the bomb attacks that reduced the city to rubble .
the far-right hopes to capitalize on the tragedy to spread its own message while others focus on reconciliation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.02.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc guantanamo prisoner presses charges amidst a broader scandal about female interrogators using sexually suggestive tactics , a lawyer for murat kurnaz , a german-born turk being held at guantanamo , said his client was sexually humiliated by three scantily clad female interrogators .
bernhard docke told the online version of der spiegel newsmagazine that his client was " sexually stimulated in a helpless position " by " three women in lacy bras and panties " at the prison .
one of the women sat on his lap , while another rubbed her breasts against him .
when he managed to push one of the women away , he was beaten by guards , docke said .
detainees have previously complained of physical abuse and exposure to temperature extremes , but according to the washington post , pentagon officials have insisted that terrorists are trained to make false torture allegations .
the charges recall the abu ghraib prisoner abuse scandal .
pentagon officials have said that being scantily clad or touching and chatting with prisoners in a suggestive manner are inappropriate interrogation methods .
" i do n't see that as being authorized by the secretary of defense 's approved interrogation techniques for guantanamo , " colonel david mcwilliams , a spokesman for the miami-based us southern command , told the post .

the administrative court in kassel , central germany , decided that members of the northern alliance no longer have anything to fear in afghanistan .
the northern alliance forces helped the united states and its other allies to oust the taliban in late 2001 .
but the court ruled that members of the communist party , which supported the soviet occupation of afghanistan in the 1980s , would still be in danger if they return home .
more than 70,000 afghan refugees are living in germany , although 8,000 of them do not have the status of refugees but are allowed to stay for the time being .
a legal freeze on sending the refugees back home , agreed by interior ministers from germany 's 16 states , runs out at the end of april . dw-world.de dw-world : first german immigration law takes effect after much wrangling with the opposition , the german government drew up an immigration law to regulate migration last year .

more than 60 people have been killed since the clashes began , in some of the most intense fighting for years .

" i have a mission to accomplish on the ground , i will finish what the rebels started , " he said .
guide to philippine conflict the fighting began on monday and appears to have been triggered by the army 's entry into rebel territory following an ambush .
the rebels are believed to include fighters from the abu sayyaf and some disgruntled members of the moro national liberation front -lrb- mnlf -rrb- , which signed a peace deal with the government in 1996 .
the philippines government said on friday that the mnlf fighters were being led by a brother of nur misuari , who used to lead the mnlf until he was jailed on charges of rebellion in 2001 .
there has been no sign yet that a larger rebel group , the mindanao-based moro islamic liberation front -lrb- milf -rrb- , will become involved in the dispute or end its ceasefire .
the latest skirmishes have been concentrated in several towns around jolo , a known stronghold for islamic militants .

by virginia gidley-kitchen bbc news kenya has run a high-profile campaign against corruption kenya 's government , which was elected on a pledge to fight corruption , has been hit by the resignation of its chief anti-corruption official john githongo this week .
donor countries have threatened to suspend aid if they can not be sure that their money will be well spent .
kenya 's leaders are not the only ones to find that eradicating corrupt practices is a tall order .
sceptics fear that the uk-led move to increase aid to africa and forgive their debts will only make more money available to corrupt elites .
western governments are increasingly linking aid to good governance , and in particular to efforts to tackle corruption .
so , is corruption in africa getting worse , or just getting more attention ?
brave william kalema , chairman of the board of the uganda investment authority , and one of the commissioners for africa named by uk prime minister tony blair , is not sure if corruption is worse than five or 10 years ago but says it is certainly more widespread than 20 or 30 years ago .
" the scale is increasing but i think also that the information about it is also increasing .
as long as politics is seen as the path to wealth , then africa is on a downward path jeremy pope transparency international " the erosion of institutions in africa has been a steady process so if the institutions get weaker every year then the time comes when they are so weakened that certain things are possible that would not have been possible before . "
jeremy pope , a founding executive director of the anti-corruption watchdog transparency international , says kenya 's anti-corruption chief john githongo did his best but was blocked by powerful political groups .
" it 's been a very gutsy performance by john , he has stuck in there to do absolutely what he could , " he said .
" he realised that he was going to get nowhere because the political forces against reform were so much stronger and were outwitting the political forces in favour of reform . "
lone reformer nigeria 's president olusegun obasanjo has also found it difficult to stamp out corruption once in office .
mr pope says he is desperately trying to get on top of corruption but that even the president can do little on his own .
corruption can spread from the top to directly affect people 's daily lives " everybody knows that come a certain date , he will be out of office , he will be gone , and the inertia is there .
it is very , very difficult for a reformer at the top unless there are people like him throughout the system . "
zambia and malawi have had a similar experiences , with new presidents promising to get tough on corruption facing political obstacles , sometimes from within their own parties " what has been revealed is a hopelessly corrupt political elite - a political class across the spectrum that simply sees politics as a way of becoming wealthy , " mr pope says .
" as long as politics is seen as the path to wealth , then africa is on a downward path . "
he points to botswana as proof that african countries can be well governed .
" they look after their money , they invest wisely , and they run a decent country with a very good human rights record . "
gloomy mr kalema says that both african countries and the west can take measures to make it harder for the corrupt to benefit from their crimes .
" in many consultative meetings people called on particularly the governments of the west to make it very much harder for ill-gotten gains to be salted away in their banks .
even the president needs help to fight corruption in nigeria other suggestions are to make it easier for african countries to recover stolen assets .
and to publish information that would enable civil society to hold leaders to account regarding the use of funds and regarding their own personal gains from public funds .
mr pope feels that the only solution is the emergence of a new political class that has not had to buy its way into politics .
but he emphasises that it is not just african countries themselves who are responsible for corruption .
" when one focuses on corruption in africa , the tendency is to think only in terms of africa .
but the international banks , the western businessmen who bribe to get the contract , who are in cahoots with all the millionaires are all up to their eyeballs in what 's taking place .
" so when it comes to moral standing everybody belongs in the gutter together . "
a gloomy picture .
but at least the new emphasis on linking aid to good governance gives both western and african governments a greater incentive to see what they can each to do to tackle the scourge of corruption .

often this help has come in the form of corporate art sponsorship or infrastructure provision .
but that dance is growing more intimate as hi-tech firms look to the creative industries for inspiration .
and vice versa .
uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative .
the idea , says bt , is to shape a " 21st century model " which will help cement the art , technology , and business worlds together .
" we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology , " said frank stone , head of the bt 's business sector programmes .
he looks after several " centres of excellence " which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations , one of which is focused on creative industries .
for tech 's sake ?
to mark the initiative 's launch , a major international art installation is to open on 15 april in brussels , with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer .
they have both been created using the telco 's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm , including a sophisticated graphics rendering program .
using a 3d graphics engine , the type commonly used in gaming , bafta-winning artists langlands & bell have created a virtual , story-based , 3d model of brussels ' coudenberg cellars .
the river was integral to the city 's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared langlands & bell they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace , an historical seat of european power .
the 3d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th century .
" the river was integral to the city 's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared , " said the artists .
" we hope that by uncovering the river , we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present , and appreciate the flow of modernity , once concealing , but now revealing the river senne . "
in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine .
the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering , game ai , and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game .
they are so time-consuming and expensive to create , the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games .
bt 's own engine , tara -lrb- total abstract rendering architecture -rrb- has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners .
it was also used in 2003 in encounter , an urban-based , pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical , on-the-street action .
because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds , new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets .
but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new , and many keen coders , designers , games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself .
not just online art as more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street , enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance , creativity will become an integral part of technology .
the orange expressionist exhibition last year , for example , displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation .
graphics engines , like the quake one , are usually licensed out to others technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential , not least because it gives people something to do with their technology .
big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too .
the art world is " fantastically rich " , said mr stone , with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them .
between 1997 and 2002 , the creative industry brought £ 21 billion to london alone .
it is an industry that is growing by 6 % a year too .
the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net , according to mr stone .
" this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online , " he said .
" it is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem . "
with broadband penetration reaching 100 % in the uk , businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it .
the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously .
it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries , or more patent ideas for tech companies .
" what we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking .
" we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy , " said mr stone .

uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative .
the idea , says bt , is to shape a " 21st century model " which will help cement the art , technology , and business worlds together .
" we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology , " said frank stone , head of the bt 's business sector programmes .
he looks after several " centres of excellence " which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations , one of which is focused on creative industries .
for tech 's sake ?
to mark the initiative 's launch , a major international art installation is to open on 15 april in brussels , with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer .
they have both been created using the telco 's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm , including a sophisticated graphics rendering program .
using a 3d graphics engine , the type commonly used in gaming , bafta-winning artists langlands & bell have created a virtual , story-based , 3d model of brussels ' coudenberg cellars .
the river was integral to the city 's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared langlands & bell they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace , an historical seat of european power .
the 3d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th century .
" the river was integral to the city 's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared , " said the artists .
" we hope that by uncovering the river , we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present , and appreciate the flow of modernity , once concealing , but now revealing the river senne . "
in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine .
the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering , game ai , and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game .
they are so time-consuming and expensive to create , the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games .
bt 's own engine , tara -lrb- total abstract rendering architecture -rrb- has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners .
it was also used in 2003 in encounter , an urban-based , pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical , on-the-street action .
because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds , new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets .
but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new , and many keen coders , designers , games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself .
not just online art as more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street , enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance , creativity will become an integral part of technology .
the orange expressionist exhibition last year , for example , displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation .
graphics engines , like the quake one , are usually licensed out to others technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential , not least because it gives people something to do with their technology .
big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too .
the art world is " fantastically rich " , said mr stone , with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them .
between 1997 and 2002 , the creative industry brought £ 21 billion to london alone .
it is an industry that is growing by 6 % a year too .
the partnership between artists and technologists is part of trying to understand the creative potential of technologies like broadband net , according to mr stone .
" this is not just about putting art galleries and museums online , " he said .
" it is about how can everyone have the best seat in house and asking if technology has a role in solving that problem . "
with broadband penetration reaching 100 % in the uk , businesses with a stake in the technology want to give people reasons to want and use it .
the creative drive is not purely altruistic obviously .
it is about both industries borrowing strategies and creative ideas together which can result in better business practices for creative industries , or more patent ideas for tech companies .
" what we are trying to do is have outside-in thinking .
" we are creating a future cultural drive for the economy , " said mr stone .

uk telco bt is serious about the idea and has launched its connected world initiative .
the idea , says bt , is to shape a " 21st century model " which will help cement the art , technology , and business worlds together .
" we are hoping to understand the creative industry that has a natural thirst for broadband technology , " said frank stone , head of the bt 's business sector programmes .
he looks after several " centres of excellence " which the telco has set up with other institutions and organisations , one of which is focused on creative industries .
for tech 's sake ?
to mark the initiative 's launch , a major international art installation is to open on 15 april in brussels , with a further exhibit in madrid later in the summer .
they have both been created using the telco 's technology that it has been incubating at its research and development arm , including a sophisticated graphics rendering program .
using a 3d graphics engine , the type commonly used in gaming , bafta-winning artists langlands & bell have created a virtual , story-based , 3d model of brussels ' coudenberg cellars .
the river was integral to the city 's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared langlands & bell they have recently been excavated and are thought to be the remnants of coudenberg palace , an historical seat of european power .
the 3d world can be navigated using a joystick and offers an immersive experience of a landscape that historically had a river running through it until it was bricked up in the 19th century .
" the river was integral to the city 's survival for hundreds of years and it was equally essential to the city that it disappeared , " said the artists .
" we hope that by uncovering the river , we can greater understand the connections between the past and the present , and appreciate the flow of modernity , once concealing , but now revealing the river senne . "
in their previous works they used the quake game graphics engine .
the game engine is the core component of a video game because it handles graphics rendering , game ai , and how objects behave and relate to each other in a game .
they are so time-consuming and expensive to create , the engines can be licensed out to handle other graphics-intensive games .
bt 's own engine , tara -lrb- total abstract rendering architecture -rrb- has been in development since 2001 and has been used to recreate virtual interactive models of buildings for planners .
it was also used in 2003 in encounter , an urban-based , pervasive game that combined both virtual play in conjunction with physical , on-the-street action .
because the artists wanted video and interactive elements in their worlds , new features were added to tara in order to handle the complex data sets .
but collaboration between art and digital technology is by no means new , and many keen coders , designers , games makers and animators argue that what they create is art itself .
not just online art as more tools for self-expression are given to the person on the street , enabling people to take photos with a phone and upload them to the web for instance , creativity will become an integral part of technology .
the orange expressionist exhibition last year , for example , displayed thousands of picture messages from people all over the uk to create an interactive installation .
graphics engines , like the quake one , are usually licensed out to others technology as a way of unleashing creativity has massive potential , not least because it gives people something to do with their technology .
big businesses know it is good for them to get in on the creative vein too .
the art world is " fantastically rich " , said mr stone , with creative people and ideas which means traditional companies like bt want to get in with them .

but few fans could name the man who provides the voice for the bright yellow sponge in both the show and its big-screen spin-off .
not that tom kenny is complaining .
" as a cartoon-obsessed child turned cartoon-obsessed grown-up , it 's been a lifelong dream to do a voice in an animated feature , " he says .
" it 's a great job .
corny as it sounds , it 's something that gets in your blood . "
having begun his career in the 1980s as a stand-up comedian , the 42-year-old father-of-two did his first voiceover in 1990 and has not looked back since .
' childlike ' " i started out more on camera as a stand-up comedian and had some success at it , " he explains .
" but then the voiceovers came along , and that aspect kept growing until it phased out everything else . "
appearances on the powerpuff girls and futurama followed , but it was spongebob squarepants - a character he has voiced since the show 's tv debut in 1999 - that really turned things around .
those uninitiated in the cult of spongebob should know that its hero is a buck-toothed sea sponge who lives on the ocean floor .
his best friend is a pink starfish called patrick , he works in a fast-food restaurant and he talks in a high-pitched gabble .
" the voice fell into place pretty quickly , " recalls kenny .
" it needed to be childlike but not a child 's voice - a voice of indeterminate age , like pee-wee herman or jerry lewis .
" there 's a helium-pitched flavour to it , like the munchkins in the wizard of oz . "
resentment light-hearted and garrulous , kenny responds to every question with good humour and easy-going charm .
but there is one subject that clearly rankles this native new yorker - namely , the way hollywood stars have invaded his territory .
eddie murphy , tom hanks and brad pitt are just some of the high-profile actors who have lent their voices to characters in animated features .
and kenny freely admits this issue has caused some resentment among the voiceover community .
" i look at voice acting as a fairly specialised skill , " he says .
" we 're good at painting a picture and a personality using only our voices .
" so we do n't appreciate highly-paid movie stars who do it over the phone , or do it on a whim because they want to do something their children can see .
" i would never assume i could waltz in and master the skill tom hanks has spent his whole life perfecting , " he continues .
" yet hollywood stars do n't have that same mindset when it comes to doing voiceover work . "
' inferiority ' kenny accepts that big names bring box-office clout to the animated genre .
and the spongebob squarepants movie is hardly blameless in this regard , having hired alec baldwin and bafta winner scarlett johansson to make guest appearances .
but he also believes such casting decisions point to a wider malaise .
" i think a lot of it is down to animation 's inferiority complex , " he says .
" it 's like it 's saying : ' see , we 're just like a real movie !
we 're using a-list actors ! '
" it 's counterproductive and aesthetically blah , but i guess one can not argue with the box office . "
having performed strongly in the us , the spongebob movie certainly has no concerns on that front .
and kenny admits to some pride in the fact that the character is so popular he has even had a church established in his name .
" i 'm always amazed by the amount of time and effort people put into things like that , " he chuckles .
" you know you 've arrived when someone builds a fake religion around your show ! "
the spongebob squarepants movie is released in the uk on 11 february .
spongebob squarepants can be seen every day on nickelodeon and nicktoons .

tom kenny began his career as a stand-up comedian but few fans could name the man who provides the voice for the bright yellow sponge in both the show and its big-screen spin-off .
not that tom kenny is complaining .
" as a cartoon-obsessed child turned cartoon-obsessed grown-up , it 's been a lifelong dream to do a voice in an animated feature , " he says .
" it 's a great job .
corny as it sounds , it 's something that gets in your blood . "
having begun his career in the 1980s as a stand-up comedian , the 42-year-old father-of-two did his first voiceover in 1990 and has not looked back since .
' childlike ' " i started out more on camera as a stand-up comedian and had some success at it , " he explains .
" but then the voiceovers came along , and that aspect kept growing until it phased out everything else . "
spongebob squarepants has built up a cult following among adults appearances on the powerpuff girls and futurama followed , but it was spongebob squarepants - a character he has voiced since the show 's tv debut in 1999 - that really turned things around .
those uninitiated in the cult of spongebob should know that its hero is a buck-toothed sea sponge who lives on the ocean floor .
his best friend is a pink starfish called patrick , he works in a fast-food restaurant and he talks in a high-pitched gabble .
" the voice fell into place pretty quickly , " recalls kenny .
" it needed to be childlike but not a child 's voice - a voice of indeterminate age , like pee-wee herman or jerry lewis .
" there 's a helium-pitched flavour to it , like the munchkins in the wizard of oz . "
resentment light-hearted and garrulous , kenny responds to every question with good humour and easy-going charm .
but there is one subject that clearly rankles this native new yorker - namely , the way hollywood stars have invaded his territory .
alec baldwin voices an evil character in the spongebob film eddie murphy , tom hanks and brad pitt are just some of the high-profile actors who have lent their voices to characters in animated features .
and kenny freely admits this issue has caused some resentment among the voiceover community .
" i look at voice acting as a fairly specialised skill , " he says .
" we 're good at painting a picture and a personality using only our voices .
" so we do n't appreciate highly-paid movie stars who do it over the phone , or do it on a whim because they want to do something their children can see .
" i would never assume i could waltz in and master the skill tom hanks has spent his whole life perfecting , " he continues .
" yet hollywood stars do n't have that same mindset when it comes to doing voiceover work . "
' inferiority ' kenny accepts that big names bring box-office clout to the animated genre .
and the spongebob squarepants movie is hardly blameless in this regard , having hired alec baldwin and bafta winner scarlett johansson to make guest appearances .
the church of spongebob offers study courses on the cartoon but he also believes such casting decisions point to a wider malaise .
" i think a lot of it is down to animation 's inferiority complex , " he says .
" it 's like it 's saying : ' see , we 're just like a real movie !
we 're using a-list actors ! '
" it 's counterproductive and aesthetically blah , but i guess one can not argue with the box office . "
having performed strongly in the us , the spongebob movie certainly has no concerns on that front .
and kenny admits to some pride in the fact that the character is so popular he has even had a church established in his name .
" i 'm always amazed by the amount of time and effort people put into things like that , " he chuckles .
" you know you 've arrived when someone builds a fake religion around your show ! "
the spongebob squarepants movie is released in the uk on 11 february .
spongebob squarepants can be seen every day on nickelodeon and nicktoons .

tom kenny began his career as a stand-up comedian but few fans could name the man who provides the voice for the bright yellow sponge in both the show and its big-screen spin-off .
not that tom kenny is complaining .
" as a cartoon-obsessed child turned cartoon-obsessed grown-up , it 's been a lifelong dream to do a voice in an animated feature , " he says .
" it 's a great job .
corny as it sounds , it 's something that gets in your blood . "
having begun his career in the 1980s as a stand-up comedian , the 42-year-old father-of-two did his first voiceover in 1990 and has not looked back since .
' childlike ' " i started out more on camera as a stand-up comedian and had some success at it , " he explains .
" but then the voiceovers came along , and that aspect kept growing until it phased out everything else . "
spongebob squarepants has built up a cult following among adults appearances on the powerpuff girls and futurama followed , but it was spongebob squarepants - a character he has voiced since the show 's tv debut in 1999 - that really turned things around .
those uninitiated in the cult of spongebob should know that its hero is a buck-toothed sea sponge who lives on the ocean floor .
his best friend is a pink starfish called patrick , he works in a fast-food restaurant and he talks in a high-pitched gabble .
" the voice fell into place pretty quickly , " recalls kenny .
" it needed to be childlike but not a child 's voice - a voice of indeterminate age , like pee-wee herman or jerry lewis .
" there 's a helium-pitched flavour to it , like the munchkins in the wizard of oz . "
resentment light-hearted and garrulous , kenny responds to every question with good humour and easy-going charm .
but there is one subject that clearly rankles this native new yorker - namely , the way hollywood stars have invaded his territory .
alec baldwin voices an evil character in the spongebob film eddie murphy , tom hanks and brad pitt are just some of the high-profile actors who have lent their voices to characters in animated features .
and kenny freely admits this issue has caused some resentment among the voiceover community .
" i look at voice acting as a fairly specialised skill , " he says .
" we 're good at painting a picture and a personality using only our voices .
" so we do n't appreciate highly-paid movie stars who do it over the phone , or do it on a whim because they want to do something their children can see .
" i would never assume i could waltz in and master the skill tom hanks has spent his whole life perfecting , " he continues .
" yet hollywood stars do n't have that same mindset when it comes to doing voiceover work . "
' inferiority ' kenny accepts that big names bring box-office clout to the animated genre .
and the spongebob squarepants movie is hardly blameless in this regard , having hired alec baldwin and bafta winner scarlett johansson to make guest appearances .
the church of spongebob offers study courses on the cartoon but he also believes such casting decisions point to a wider malaise .
" i think a lot of it is down to animation 's inferiority complex , " he says .
" it 's like it 's saying : ' see , we 're just like a real movie !
we 're using a-list actors ! '
" it 's counterproductive and aesthetically blah , but i guess one can not argue with the box office . "
having performed strongly in the us , the spongebob movie certainly has no concerns on that front .
and kenny admits to some pride in the fact that the character is so popular he has even had a church established in his name .
" i 'm always amazed by the amount of time and effort people put into things like that , " he chuckles .
" you know you 've arrived when someone builds a fake religion around your show ! "
the spongebob squarepants movie is released in the uk on 11 february .
spongebob squarepants can be seen every day on nickelodeon and nicktoons .

essential guide to british quangos 2005 author dan lewis said at least 111 of the appointed bodies had been set up since labour won power in 1997 .
he urged a limit on the number of quangos that could be set up by any individual government department .
tories and lib dems welcomed the report and called for a " slimming down " .
' explosion ' conservative deregulation spokesman john redwood said : " the research endorses our policy of destroying unwanted and unnecessary quangos , and slimming down the rest .
' most expensive quangos ' legal service commission - £ 2.1bn scottish education funding council - £ 800m northern health and social services board - £ 550m teacher training agency - £ 514.6m " a conservative government will axe 162 quangos , as part of its drive for more efficient and more accountable government . "
lib dem spokesman ed davey meanwhile said instead of the " bonfire of quangos " new labour had promised , there had been an " explosion " of them .
" for over two decades , under both tory and labour governments , these unaccountable agencies have mushroomed .
" liberal democrats would abolish many , merge others , and make any that remain properly accountable . "
labour representatives were unavailable for comment .
the quango guide follows last year 's government-commissioned gershon report which recommended significant cuts in bureaucracy across the public sector .
time limit ' most useless quangos ' british potato council milk development council energy savings trust agricultural wages committees wine standards board westminster foundation for democracy football licensing authority investors in people uk economic and social research council mr lewis wants a public inquiry into regional development agencies which cost £ 1.8bn a year - cash he says which " appears to be almost entirely wasted " .
as well as a departmental limit on quangos he also wants a statutory five-year limit on any such body with executive powers .
he also listed what he dubbed the nine " most useless quangos " .
they were the british potato council , the milk development council , the energy savings trust , agricultural wages committees , the wine standards board , the westminster foundation for democracy , the football licensing authority , investors in people uk and the economic and social research council .
mr lewis branded the existence of the 60-employee potato council , set up in 1997 to research and promote overseas potato markets , " surprising " .
he said the £ 80m spent annually on the energy savings trust , which promotes renewable energy , would be better spent on eight million boiler jackets for british homes .
rooney and he argued it was " absurd " to charge farmers for agricultural wages committees , which set working and wage standards in the industry , when many were prepared to take advantage of immigrant labour prepared to work for £ 1 an hour .
" if a football team can afford to pay £ 27m for wayne rooney , why should the taxpayer - not all of whom like football - be forced to fund the football licensing authority to the tune of over £ 1.1m a year ? "
mr lewis asked .
the report is published by the efficiency in government unit - a joint effort by right of centre think tanks the economic research council and the centre for policy studies .
it says before a new public body is set up , an assessment should be made whether its proposed role is already carried out by an existing charity or other private organisation .
