" two other funds , children 's investment fund management and atticus capital , each of which holds more than five percent in deutsche börse 's rival euronext , are also opposed , having determined that the deutsche börse offer - 530 pence per share , or nearly € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - is too high . " we think that this strategy compromises the long-term value of -lrb- deutsche börse , " atticus director david slager told the french newspaper la tribune in an article appearing friday .
" we are asking therefore the resignation of the current management and its replacement by one that would undertake a share buy-back . " deutsche börse has so far rejected atticus 's request for a special shareholder assembly to discuss the lse acquisition .
deutsche börse officials , having initially disdained shareholder unhappiness , have lately softened their tone .

german press reports have said deutsche börse shareholders who oppose or are critical of the lse bid control 30 percent of the frankfurt operator 's capital .
if a vote is taken in may at a regularly scheduled assembly they would need only to pass the 50 percent threshold to derail the project . in germany , there is also uneasiness at the prospect of transferring deutsche börse financial activities to london , which would deprive frankfurt of some of its stature .
on friday the regional government of hesse , which includes frankfurt , demanded to be heard . " we want more transparency , " regional finance minister karlheinz weimar told financial times deutschland newspaper . german media have also said that negotiations between the lse and british financial circles - the city - on the deutsche börse initiative have run into difficulties .
the city is reportedly demanding that the headquarters of a merged entity be transferred to london , which deutsche börse has so far rejected . under such circumstances , the chances of a hostile takeover aimed at the lse are growing , a development that deutsche börse head werner seifert declined to rule out last week . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt fears lse takeover as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.02.2005 iran signs russian nuclear deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant , could go online in 2006 iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development . under the agreement , which would cap an $ 800-million contract to build and bring the bushehr plant on line , russia will fuel the reactor on condition that iran sends back spent fuel , which could be upgraded to weapons use . iranian media said russia 's top atomic energy official alexander rumyantsev and his iranian counterpart gholamreza aghazadeh inked the deal during a tour of the russian-built power plant at bushehr in southern iran .
washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

" we want more transparency , " regional finance minister karlheinz weimar told financial times deutschland newspaper . german media have also said that negotiations between the lse and british financial circles - the city - on the deutsche börse initiative have run into difficulties .
the city is reportedly demanding that the headquarters of a merged entity be transferred to london , which deutsche börse has so far rejected . under such circumstances , the chances of a hostile takeover aimed at the lse are growing , a development that deutsche börse head werner seifert declined to rule out last week . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt fears lse takeover as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.02.2005 french castles go private großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haut-koenigsbourg in the alsace france is planning to privatize 178 historical castles and monuments .
but regional authorities fear they may get saddled with decrepit and indebted buildings that ca n't support themselves . the monastery of montmajour with its mighty 14th century keep is not far from the city of arles in southern france .
it can be seen from afar and is of great renown .
van gogh painted it many times .
yet , it does n't make any money : in 2002 , it carried a deficit of € 46,000 -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- .
the amount of debts almost trebled within one year , rising to € 131,000 in 2003 .
thus , the monastery has become a business of subsidies , which the french government would like to be rid of .
in the course of its decentralization policy , france aims to cede parts of its national cultural heritage to the administrative sovereignty of provinces and local authorities - for free .
but the association of french provinces has complained that the law allowing the transfer was passed without the approval of the affected bodies which fear high maintenance and restoration costs .
it 's a " poisoned gift " , many local politicians say .
nobody knows whether the state will grant financial support for the monuments ' renovation .
an uncertain future the french decentralization law of 2004 says restorations " could be subsidized by the state . "
but the subjunctive form dominating the phrase is the object of broad disapproval .
in the case of the villa cavrois , which is situated close to the industrial city of rubaix in northern france , the relevant local authority of croix asserted it did n't have the necessary resources for taking over the building .
the monument , built by architect modern french designer robert mallet-stevens -lrb- 1886-1945 -rrb- , is in a state of decay and is currently being renovated by the state .
altogether , the french government owns 400 historical monuments .
" they 're trying to foist all the monuments that they do n't want anymore to us , " michel vauzelle , president of the province provence-alpes-cotes d 'azur , complains .
just two years ago , he had been enthusiastic about the idea of making the castles and churches property of the provincial administrations .
but in the meantime , he has come to a completely different view of the situation .
" this law is going to ruin one of the most important parts of our cultural landscape . "
bildunterschrift : alsace small successes the castle haut-koenigsbourg in alsace is one of the few monuments able to fund its own upkeep .
the completely renovated castle attracts 500,000 visitors each year .
" the purchase is part of our policy in favor of castles and ruins of the vosges -lrb- mountains -rrb- .
we intend to turn the castle haut-koenigsbourg into our engine , " philippe richert , president of the lower rhine regional council said .
but other historical monuments are n't so profitable .
the list of monuments on the block includes silvacane abbey , the palace of jacques coeur in bourges and the castle of chaumont-sur-loire .
in 2000 , unesco declared the loire valley between sully and chalonnes part of world cultural heritage in order to preserve the unique natural and cultural landscape there .
but the area remains inadequate as a destination for day-trip mass tourism .
the small castles are especially beautiful , but the private owners know from sorrowful experience what it takes to maintain the premises : the château de villesavin , for example , has 20,000 guests per year - not enough to provide the adequate funds for restoration . dw staff -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .
the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down .

3 , 2005 -rrb- alsace paves the way for french decentralization as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .

" two other funds , children 's investment fund management and atticus capital , each of which holds more than five percent in deutsche börse 's rival euronext , are also opposed , having determined that the deutsche börse offer - 530 pence per share , or nearly € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - is too high . " we think that this strategy compromises the long-term value of -lrb- deutsche börse , " atticus director david slager told the french newspaper la tribune in an article appearing friday .
" we are asking therefore the resignation of the current management and its replacement by one that would undertake a share buy-back . " deutsche börse has so far rejected atticus 's request for a special shareholder assembly to discuss the lse acquisition .
deutsche börse officials , having initially disdained shareholder unhappiness , have lately softened their tone . " we are aware of the diverse opinions of our shareholders on the question of our offer for the london stock exchange and we are engaged in a dialogue with them , " said a deutsche börse spokesman . critical of the bid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will i have to move to london ?
german press reports have said deutsche börse shareholders who oppose or are critical of the lse bid control 30 percent of the frankfurt operator 's capital .
if a vote is taken in may at a regularly scheduled assembly they would need only to pass the 50 percent threshold to derail the project . in germany , there is also uneasiness at the prospect of transferring deutsche börse financial activities to london , which would deprive frankfurt of some of its stature .
on friday the regional government of hesse , which includes frankfurt , demanded to be heard . " we want more transparency , " regional finance minister karlheinz weimar told financial times deutschland newspaper . german media have also said that negotiations between the lse and british financial circles - the city - on the deutsche börse initiative have run into difficulties .
the city is reportedly demanding that the headquarters of a merged entity be transferred to london , which deutsche börse has so far rejected . under such circumstances , the chances of a hostile takeover aimed at the lse are growing , a development that deutsche börse head werner seifert declined to rule out last week . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt fears lse takeover as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal .

their interest in the region is high as proven by the fact that 190 firms applied to accompany schröder - only 70 managed to get a seat on the plane , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- inaugurates a fountain in the uae ' ´ s liwa oasis in 2003 one of the biggest projects is a $ 1.3-billion -lrb- € 985-million -rrb- petro-chemical plant in bahrain set to be built in a joint venture involving germany 's linde group .

berlin feels that iran does not for the moment represent a danger to its neighbors but notes the nuclear issue could instantly change that . schröder is also likely to seek assurances that the gulf states support efforts to reach a peaceful solution in the middle east now that hopes have been raised since mahmoud abbas took over as palestinian leader . meeting iraqi soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier -lrb- in the back -rrb- instructs iraqi soldiers in the uae last december in the uae , where he will conclude his trip on march 5 , schröder will meet iraqi officers being put through their paces by german instructors in one of the only projects linked to the iraq war that germany has so far supported . a total of 420 iraqi police have already been trained and the next phase , beginning in april , will involve techniques for rebuilding bridges and roads . launching dw-tv 's arabic service during his visit to kuwait on monday , schröder will officially launch deutsche welle 's new arabic tv program . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder has both praise and criticism for saudis on his final day of talks in saudi arabia , german chancellor gerhard schröder had a mixed message for his hosts .

but regional authorities fear they may get saddled with decrepit and indebted buildings that ca n't support themselves . the monastery of montmajour with its mighty 14th century keep is not far from the city of arles in southern france .
it can be seen from afar and is of great renown .
van gogh painted it many times .
yet , it does n't make any money : in 2002 , it carried a deficit of € 46,000 -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- .
the amount of debts almost trebled within one year , rising to € 131,000 in 2003 .
thus , the monastery has become a business of subsidies , which the french government would like to be rid of .
in the course of its decentralization policy , france aims to cede parts of its national cultural heritage to the administrative sovereignty of provinces and local authorities - for free .
but the association of french provinces has complained that the law allowing the transfer was passed without the approval of the affected bodies which fear high maintenance and restoration costs .
it 's a " poisoned gift " , many local politicians say .
nobody knows whether the state will grant financial support for the monuments ' renovation .
an uncertain future the french decentralization law of 2004 says restorations " could be subsidized by the state . "
but the subjunctive form dominating the phrase is the object of broad disapproval .
in the case of the villa cavrois , which is situated close to the industrial city of rubaix in northern france , the relevant local authority of croix asserted it did n't have the necessary resources for taking over the building .
the monument , built by architect modern french designer robert mallet-stevens -lrb- 1886-1945 -rrb- , is in a state of decay and is currently being renovated by the state .
altogether , the french government owns 400 historical monuments .
" they 're trying to foist all the monuments that they do n't want anymore to us , " michel vauzelle , president of the province provence-alpes-cotes d 'azur , complains .
just two years ago , he had been enthusiastic about the idea of making the castles and churches property of the provincial administrations .
but in the meantime , he has come to a completely different view of the situation .
" this law is going to ruin one of the most important parts of our cultural landscape . "
bildunterschrift : alsace small successes the castle haut-koenigsbourg in alsace is one of the few monuments able to fund its own upkeep .
the completely renovated castle attracts 500,000 visitors each year .
" the purchase is part of our policy in favor of castles and ruins of the vosges -lrb- mountains -rrb- .
we intend to turn the castle haut-koenigsbourg into our engine , " philippe richert , president of the lower rhine regional council said .
but other historical monuments are n't so profitable .
the list of monuments on the block includes silvacane abbey , the palace of jacques coeur in bourges and the castle of chaumont-sur-loire .
in 2000 , unesco declared the loire valley between sully and chalonnes part of world cultural heritage in order to preserve the unique natural and cultural landscape there .
but the area remains inadequate as a destination for day-trip mass tourism .
the small castles are especially beautiful , but the private owners know from sorrowful experience what it takes to maintain the premises : the château de villesavin , for example , has 20,000 guests per year - not enough to provide the adequate funds for restoration . dw staff -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .
the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down .

but regional authorities fear they may get saddled with decrepit and indebted buildings that ca n't support themselves . the monastery of montmajour with its mighty 14th century keep is not far from the city of arles in southern france .
it can be seen from afar and is of great renown .
van gogh painted it many times .
yet , it does n't make any money : in 2002 , it carried a deficit of € 46,000 -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- .
the amount of debts almost trebled within one year , rising to € 131,000 in 2003 .
thus , the monastery has become a business of subsidies , which the french government would like to be rid of .
in the course of its decentralization policy , france aims to cede parts of its national cultural heritage to the administrative sovereignty of provinces and local authorities - for free .
but the association of french provinces has complained that the law allowing the transfer was passed without the approval of the affected bodies which fear high maintenance and restoration costs .
it 's a " poisoned gift " , many local politicians say .
nobody knows whether the state will grant financial support for the monuments ' renovation .
an uncertain future the french decentralization law of 2004 says restorations " could be subsidized by the state . "
but the subjunctive form dominating the phrase is the object of broad disapproval .
in the case of the villa cavrois , which is situated close to the industrial city of rubaix in northern france , the relevant local authority of croix asserted it did n't have the necessary resources for taking over the building .
the monument , built by architect modern french designer robert mallet-stevens -lrb- 1886-1945 -rrb- , is in a state of decay and is currently being renovated by the state .
altogether , the french government owns 400 historical monuments .
" they 're trying to foist all the monuments that they do n't want anymore to us , " michel vauzelle , president of the province provence-alpes-cotes d 'azur , complains .
just two years ago , he had been enthusiastic about the idea of making the castles and churches property of the provincial administrations .
but in the meantime , he has come to a completely different view of the situation .
" this law is going to ruin one of the most important parts of our cultural landscape . "
bildunterschrift : alsace small successes the castle haut-koenigsbourg in alsace is one of the few monuments able to fund its own upkeep .
the completely renovated castle attracts 500,000 visitors each year .
" the purchase is part of our policy in favor of castles and ruins of the vosges -lrb- mountains -rrb- .
we intend to turn the castle haut-koenigsbourg into our engine , " philippe richert , president of the lower rhine regional council said .
but other historical monuments are n't so profitable .
the list of monuments on the block includes silvacane abbey , the palace of jacques coeur in bourges and the castle of chaumont-sur-loire .
in 2000 , unesco declared the loire valley between sully and chalonnes part of world cultural heritage in order to preserve the unique natural and cultural landscape there .
but the area remains inadequate as a destination for day-trip mass tourism .
the small castles are especially beautiful , but the private owners know from sorrowful experience what it takes to maintain the premises : the château de villesavin , for example , has 20,000 guests per year - not enough to provide the adequate funds for restoration . dw staff -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

while he 'll promote german business interests , iran , iraq and the mid east peace process are also high on the agenda . the trip will take schröder to saudi arabia , kuwait , qatar , bahrain , yemen , oman and the united arab emirates -lrb- uae -rrb- and is his second to the region in the space of 18 months . as is often the case on the chancellor 's visits abroad , he will take along a delegation of german business leaders .
their interest in the region is high as proven by the fact that 190 firms applied to accompany schröder - only 70 managed to get a seat on the plane , however . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schröder -lrb- 2nd from right -rrb- inaugurates a fountain in the uae ' ´ s liwa oasis in 2003 one of the biggest projects is a $ 1.3-billion -lrb- € 985-million -rrb- petro-chemical plant in bahrain set to be built in a joint venture involving germany 's linde group .
the bahraini government warned this week it was not yet ready to sign contracts for work to begin on the project . german technology giant siemens is eyeing a € 430-million power plant contract in the uae , where germany 's rheinmetall is expected to sell 32 tanks for € 160 million .
yemen has voiced interest in buying 10 patrol boats for € 100 million . not pushy about reforms germany also wants to " encourage a reform process " but insists this should be a matter for the countries themselves .
for the german government , industrial development in the gulf can go hand in hand with democratic progress . " we want to support the modernization initiatives in a region of strategic importance , " a german government source told afp . region 's support " essential " on iran the current nuclear crisis with iran will also play a role during schröder 's trip . " support from the countries in the region is essential if iran is to be brought out of its current isolation , " the source said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian security adviser hassan rohani and german foreign minister joschka fischer in berlin on friday germany is opposed to iran developing a nuclear weapon and is part of the european union effort to dissuade tehran from destabilizing the region with an arms race .
berlin feels that iran does not for the moment represent a danger to its neighbors but notes the nuclear issue could instantly change that . schröder is also likely to seek assurances that the gulf states support efforts to reach a peaceful solution in the middle east now that hopes have been raised since mahmoud abbas took over as palestinian leader . meeting iraqi soldiers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german soldier -lrb- in the back -rrb- instructs iraqi soldiers in the uae last december in the uae , where he will conclude his trip on march 5 , schröder will meet iraqi officers being put through their paces by german instructors in one of the only projects linked to the iraq war that germany has so far supported . a total of 420 iraqi police have already been trained and the next phase , beginning in april , will involve techniques for rebuilding bridges and roads . launching dw-tv 's arabic service during his visit to kuwait on monday , schröder will officially launch deutsche welle 's new arabic tv program . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder has both praise and criticism for saudis on his final day of talks in saudi arabia , german chancellor gerhard schröder had a mixed message for his hosts .

an uncertain future the french decentralization law of 2004 says restorations " could be subsidized by the state . "
but the subjunctive form dominating the phrase is the object of broad disapproval .
in the case of the villa cavrois , which is situated close to the industrial city of rubaix in northern france , the relevant local authority of croix asserted it did n't have the necessary resources for taking over the building .
the monument , built by architect modern french designer robert mallet-stevens -lrb- 1886-1945 -rrb- , is in a state of decay and is currently being renovated by the state .
altogether , the french government owns 400 historical monuments .
" they 're trying to foist all the monuments that they do n't want anymore to us , " michel vauzelle , president of the province provence-alpes-cotes d 'azur , complains .
just two years ago , he had been enthusiastic about the idea of making the castles and churches property of the provincial administrations .
but in the meantime , he has come to a completely different view of the situation .
" this law is going to ruin one of the most important parts of our cultural landscape . "
bildunterschrift : alsace small successes the castle haut-koenigsbourg in alsace is one of the few monuments able to fund its own upkeep .
the completely renovated castle attracts 500,000 visitors each year .
" the purchase is part of our policy in favor of castles and ruins of the vosges -lrb- mountains -rrb- .
we intend to turn the castle haut-koenigsbourg into our engine , " philippe richert , president of the lower rhine regional council said .
but other historical monuments are n't so profitable .
the list of monuments on the block includes silvacane abbey , the palace of jacques coeur in bourges and the castle of chaumont-sur-loire .
in 2000 , unesco declared the loire valley between sully and chalonnes part of world cultural heritage in order to preserve the unique natural and cultural landscape there .
but the area remains inadequate as a destination for day-trip mass tourism .
the small castles are especially beautiful , but the private owners know from sorrowful experience what it takes to maintain the premises : the château de villesavin , for example , has 20,000 guests per year - not enough to provide the adequate funds for restoration . dw staff -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .
the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down .
-lrb- jan .
3 , 2005 -rrb- alsace paves the way for french decentralization as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.02.2005 french castles go private großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haut-koenigsbourg in the alsace france is planning to privatize 178 historical castles and monuments .
but regional authorities fear they may get saddled with decrepit and indebted buildings that ca n't support themselves . the monastery of montmajour with its mighty 14th century keep is not far from the city of arles in southern france .
it can be seen from afar and is of great renown .
van gogh painted it many times .
yet , it does n't make any money : in 2002 , it carried a deficit of € 46,000 -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- .
the amount of debts almost trebled within one year , rising to € 131,000 in 2003 .
thus , the monastery has become a business of subsidies , which the french government would like to be rid of .
in the course of its decentralization policy , france aims to cede parts of its national cultural heritage to the administrative sovereignty of provinces and local authorities - for free .
but the association of french provinces has complained that the law allowing the transfer was passed without the approval of the affected bodies which fear high maintenance and restoration costs .
it 's a " poisoned gift " , many local politicians say .
nobody knows whether the state will grant financial support for the monuments ' renovation .
an uncertain future the french decentralization law of 2004 says restorations " could be subsidized by the state . "
but the subjunctive form dominating the phrase is the object of broad disapproval .
in the case of the villa cavrois , which is situated close to the industrial city of rubaix in northern france , the relevant local authority of croix asserted it did n't have the necessary resources for taking over the building .
the monument , built by architect modern french designer robert mallet-stevens -lrb- 1886-1945 -rrb- , is in a state of decay and is currently being renovated by the state .
altogether , the french government owns 400 historical monuments .
" they 're trying to foist all the monuments that they do n't want anymore to us , " michel vauzelle , president of the province provence-alpes-cotes d 'azur , complains .
just two years ago , he had been enthusiastic about the idea of making the castles and churches property of the provincial administrations .
but in the meantime , he has come to a completely different view of the situation .
" this law is going to ruin one of the most important parts of our cultural landscape . "
bildunterschrift : alsace small successes the castle haut-koenigsbourg in alsace is one of the few monuments able to fund its own upkeep .
the completely renovated castle attracts 500,000 visitors each year .
" the purchase is part of our policy in favor of castles and ruins of the vosges -lrb- mountains -rrb- .
we intend to turn the castle haut-koenigsbourg into our engine , " philippe richert , president of the lower rhine regional council said .
but other historical monuments are n't so profitable .
the list of monuments on the block includes silvacane abbey , the palace of jacques coeur in bourges and the castle of chaumont-sur-loire .
in 2000 , unesco declared the loire valley between sully and chalonnes part of world cultural heritage in order to preserve the unique natural and cultural landscape there .
but the area remains inadequate as a destination for day-trip mass tourism .
the small castles are especially beautiful , but the private owners know from sorrowful experience what it takes to maintain the premises : the château de villesavin , for example , has 20,000 guests per year - not enough to provide the adequate funds for restoration . dw staff -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .
the town was lucky : for a time , many of its unique monuments were in danger of being torn down .

but regional authorities fear they may get saddled with decrepit and indebted buildings that ca n't support themselves . the monastery of montmajour with its mighty 14th century keep is not far from the city of arles in southern france .
it can be seen from afar and is of great renown .
van gogh painted it many times .
yet , it does n't make any money : in 2002 , it carried a deficit of € 46,000 -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- .
the amount of debts almost trebled within one year , rising to € 131,000 in 2003 .
thus , the monastery has become a business of subsidies , which the french government would like to be rid of .
in the course of its decentralization policy , france aims to cede parts of its national cultural heritage to the administrative sovereignty of provinces and local authorities - for free .
but the association of french provinces has complained that the law allowing the transfer was passed without the approval of the affected bodies which fear high maintenance and restoration costs .
it 's a " poisoned gift " , many local politicians say .
nobody knows whether the state will grant financial support for the monuments ' renovation .
an uncertain future the french decentralization law of 2004 says restorations " could be subsidized by the state . "
but the subjunctive form dominating the phrase is the object of broad disapproval .
in the case of the villa cavrois , which is situated close to the industrial city of rubaix in northern france , the relevant local authority of croix asserted it did n't have the necessary resources for taking over the building .

bildunterschrift : alsace small successes the castle haut-koenigsbourg in alsace is one of the few monuments able to fund its own upkeep .
the completely renovated castle attracts 500,000 visitors each year .
" the purchase is part of our policy in favor of castles and ruins of the vosges -lrb- mountains -rrb- .
we intend to turn the castle haut-koenigsbourg into our engine , " philippe richert , president of the lower rhine regional council said .

but regional authorities fear they may get saddled with decrepit and indebted buildings that ca n't support themselves . the monastery of montmajour with its mighty 14th century keep is not far from the city of arles in southern france .
it can be seen from afar and is of great renown .
van gogh painted it many times .
yet , it does n't make any money : in 2002 , it carried a deficit of € 46,000 -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- .
the amount of debts almost trebled within one year , rising to € 131,000 in 2003 .
thus , the monastery has become a business of subsidies , which the french government would like to be rid of .
in the course of its decentralization policy , france aims to cede parts of its national cultural heritage to the administrative sovereignty of provinces and local authorities - for free .
but the association of french provinces has complained that the law allowing the transfer was passed without the approval of the affected bodies which fear high maintenance and restoration costs .
it 's a " poisoned gift " , many local politicians say .
nobody knows whether the state will grant financial support for the monuments ' renovation .
an uncertain future the french decentralization law of 2004 says restorations " could be subsidized by the state . "
but the subjunctive form dominating the phrase is the object of broad disapproval .
in the case of the villa cavrois , which is situated close to the industrial city of rubaix in northern france , the relevant local authority of croix asserted it did n't have the necessary resources for taking over the building .
the monument , built by architect modern french designer robert mallet-stevens -lrb- 1886-1945 -rrb- , is in a state of decay and is currently being renovated by the state .
altogether , the french government owns 400 historical monuments .
" they 're trying to foist all the monuments that they do n't want anymore to us , " michel vauzelle , president of the province provence-alpes-cotes d 'azur , complains .
just two years ago , he had been enthusiastic about the idea of making the castles and churches property of the provincial administrations .
but in the meantime , he has come to a completely different view of the situation .
" this law is going to ruin one of the most important parts of our cultural landscape . "
bildunterschrift : alsace small successes the castle haut-koenigsbourg in alsace is one of the few monuments able to fund its own upkeep .
the completely renovated castle attracts 500,000 visitors each year .
" the purchase is part of our policy in favor of castles and ruins of the vosges -lrb- mountains -rrb- .
we intend to turn the castle haut-koenigsbourg into our engine , " philippe richert , president of the lower rhine regional council said .
but other historical monuments are n't so profitable .
the list of monuments on the block includes silvacane abbey , the palace of jacques coeur in bourges and the castle of chaumont-sur-loire .
in 2000 , unesco declared the loire valley between sully and chalonnes part of world cultural heritage in order to preserve the unique natural and cultural landscape there .
but the area remains inadequate as a destination for day-trip mass tourism .
the small castles are especially beautiful , but the private owners know from sorrowful experience what it takes to maintain the premises : the château de villesavin , for example , has 20,000 guests per year - not enough to provide the adequate funds for restoration . dw staff -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

" two other funds , children 's investment fund management and atticus capital , each of which holds more than five percent in deutsche börse 's rival euronext , are also opposed , having determined that the deutsche börse offer - 530 pence per share , or nearly € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - is too high . " we think that this strategy compromises the long-term value of -lrb- deutsche börse , " atticus director david slager told the french newspaper la tribune in an article appearing friday .
" we are asking therefore the resignation of the current management and its replacement by one that would undertake a share buy-back . " deutsche börse has so far rejected atticus 's request for a special shareholder assembly to discuss the lse acquisition .
deutsche börse officials , having initially disdained shareholder unhappiness , have lately softened their tone .

german press reports have said deutsche börse shareholders who oppose or are critical of the lse bid control 30 percent of the frankfurt operator 's capital .
if a vote is taken in may at a regularly scheduled assembly they would need only to pass the 50 percent threshold to derail the project . in germany , there is also uneasiness at the prospect of transferring deutsche börse financial activities to london , which would deprive frankfurt of some of its stature .
on friday the regional government of hesse , which includes frankfurt , demanded to be heard . " we want more transparency , " regional finance minister karlheinz weimar told financial times deutschland newspaper . german media have also said that negotiations between the lse and british financial circles - the city - on the deutsche börse initiative have run into difficulties .
the city is reportedly demanding that the headquarters of a merged entity be transferred to london , which deutsche börse has so far rejected . under such circumstances , the chances of a hostile takeover aimed at the lse are growing , a development that deutsche börse head werner seifert declined to rule out last week . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt fears lse takeover as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.02.2005 iran signs russian nuclear deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant , could go online in 2006 iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development . under the agreement , which would cap an $ 800-million contract to build and bring the bushehr plant on line , russia will fuel the reactor on condition that iran sends back spent fuel , which could be upgraded to weapons use . iranian media said russia 's top atomic energy official alexander rumyantsev and his iranian counterpart gholamreza aghazadeh inked the deal during a tour of the russian-built power plant at bushehr in southern iran .
washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

but regional authorities fear they may get saddled with decrepit and indebted buildings that ca n't support themselves . the monastery of montmajour with its mighty 14th century keep is not far from the city of arles in southern france .
it can be seen from afar and is of great renown .
van gogh painted it many times .
yet , it does n't make any money : in 2002 , it carried a deficit of € 46,000 -lrb- $ 61,000 -rrb- .
the amount of debts almost trebled within one year , rising to € 131,000 in 2003 .
thus , the monastery has become a business of subsidies , which the french government would like to be rid of .
in the course of its decentralization policy , france aims to cede parts of its national cultural heritage to the administrative sovereignty of provinces and local authorities - for free .
but the association of french provinces has complained that the law allowing the transfer was passed without the approval of the affected bodies which fear high maintenance and restoration costs .
it 's a " poisoned gift " , many local politicians say .
nobody knows whether the state will grant financial support for the monuments ' renovation .
an uncertain future the french decentralization law of 2004 says restorations " could be subsidized by the state . "
but the subjunctive form dominating the phrase is the object of broad disapproval .
in the case of the villa cavrois , which is situated close to the industrial city of rubaix in northern france , the relevant local authority of croix asserted it did n't have the necessary resources for taking over the building .
the monument , built by architect modern french designer robert mallet-stevens -lrb- 1886-1945 -rrb- , is in a state of decay and is currently being renovated by the state .
altogether , the french government owns 400 historical monuments .
" they 're trying to foist all the monuments that they do n't want anymore to us , " michel vauzelle , president of the province provence-alpes-cotes d 'azur , complains .
just two years ago , he had been enthusiastic about the idea of making the castles and churches property of the provincial administrations .
but in the meantime , he has come to a completely different view of the situation .
" this law is going to ruin one of the most important parts of our cultural landscape . "
bildunterschrift : alsace small successes the castle haut-koenigsbourg in alsace is one of the few monuments able to fund its own upkeep .
the completely renovated castle attracts 500,000 visitors each year .
" the purchase is part of our policy in favor of castles and ruins of the vosges -lrb- mountains -rrb- .
we intend to turn the castle haut-koenigsbourg into our engine , " philippe richert , president of the lower rhine regional council said .
but other historical monuments are n't so profitable .
the list of monuments on the block includes silvacane abbey , the palace of jacques coeur in bourges and the castle of chaumont-sur-loire .
in 2000 , unesco declared the loire valley between sully and chalonnes part of world cultural heritage in order to preserve the unique natural and cultural landscape there .
but the area remains inadequate as a destination for day-trip mass tourism .
the small castles are especially beautiful , but the private owners know from sorrowful experience what it takes to maintain the premises : the château de villesavin , for example , has 20,000 guests per year - not enough to provide the adequate funds for restoration . dw staff -lrb- bm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's rescued storybook village the eastern german town of quedlinburg has been a unesco world heritage site since for the past 10 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.02.2005 iran signs russian nuclear deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bushehr nuclear power plant , could go online in 2006 iran and russia on sunday signed a landmark nuclear fuel accord that paves the way for the islamic republic 's first atomic power station , a project the united states alleges is part of a cover for weapons development . under the agreement , which would cap an $ 800-million contract to build and bring the bushehr plant on line , russia will fuel the reactor on condition that iran sends back spent fuel , which could be upgraded to weapons use . iranian media said russia 's top atomic energy official alexander rumyantsev and his iranian counterpart gholamreza aghazadeh inked the deal during a tour of the russian-built power plant at bushehr in southern iran .
washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .
" we signed a confidential protocol setting out the schedule for delivery of fuel . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gholamreza aghazadeh , head of atomic energy organization of iran .
the quantity of fuel involved was around 100 tons , rumyantsev said .
aghazadeh told state television that the power station was likely to be fully equipped within 10 months , with tests taking place by mid-2006 . no immediate delivery a russian foreign ministry spokesman said the agreement signed sunday between for the return of spent nuclear fuel from a civilian plant did not mean that deliveries of the fuel to iran will begin immediately .
spokesman alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency as saying the nuclear fuel would be delivered from russia to iran only when construction of the station at bushehr had reached the stage where it was ready for insertion of the fuel . " russia 's signature with iran of the agreement on return of spent nuclear fuel does not mean that delivery of russian nuclear fuel to this country is to start immediately , " alexander yakovenko was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . although us president george w. bush and russian president vladimir putin agreed at a summit thursday that iran should not develop nuclear weapons , moscow has stuck by the lucrative contract .
germany kicked off work on the plant in the 1970s , but activity froze during the 1979 islamic revolution and the 1980-88 iran-iraq war . according to russian diplomats , the united states has been lobbying against moscow 's involvement in iran 's nuclear program " on a daily basis " .
they say the huge contract has helped save russia 's atomic energy industry , and emphasize there is no way that bushehr - also under international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- scrutiny - could constitute part of a weapons program . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia is also examining the option of building a second reactor at bushehr along with plants at other locations .
but the united states argues iran - lumped into an " axis of evil " - has no need for nuclear energy because of its massive oil and gas supplies .
it wants to see iran hauled before the un security council for possible sanctions . tehran denies it wants bomb tehran counters that it needs to free up fossil fuels for export and meet increased energy demands from a burgeoning population .
it also flatly denies allegations that it is seeking an atomic bomb .
iran also intends to produce its own nuclear fuel for future plants - hoped to produce 7,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020 - a drive at the center of the current stand-off with the international community . britain , france and germany have been trying to persuade tehran to permanently stop enriching uranium - which can be directed to both civil and military uses - in return for a package of incentives .
but enrichment for peaceful purposes is permitted under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , and iran insists it only wants to enrich uranium to levels required for civil purposes . the fiercely isolationist clerical regime also argues that it does not want to be dependent on foreign fuel - a position likely to be reinforced by the difficulties encountered in negotiating russian supplies . " during this trip we made it quite clear that enrichment is not negotiable , " nuclear negotiator and top cleric hassan rowhani told state media on sunday upon his return to tehran from a visit to paris and berlin . a two-year probe by the iaea , the un body that monitors the npt , has uncovered plenty of suspect activity by iran , but no conclusive " smoking gun " to prove that the country has military plans for its program . afp / dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iranian negotiator would welcome us help iran 's chief nuclear negotiator in berlin on friday said he would welcome us assistance in the talks over his country 's controversial nuclear program .

washington , convinced that iran is seeking to build atomic weapons , has been trying to convince moscow to halt its nuclear cooperation with iran . the condition that spent fuel be returned was built into the deal as a concession to western concerns over iran 's ambitions .
tehran initially rejected the condition , but eventually relented after two years of negotiations . the dispute over the fate of spent fuel had pushed the plant 's opening back to january 2006 .
the deal faced a further snag saturday when iran objected to a russian proposal to further delay firing up the plant 's reactor .
according to russia 's itar-tass news agency , the plant is now scheduled to go online at the end of 2006 . " we foresee physical startup at the end of 2006 , with the fuel to be delivered around half a year before that , " rumyantsev was quoted as saying .

" two other funds , children 's investment fund management and atticus capital , each of which holds more than five percent in deutsche börse 's rival euronext , are also opposed , having determined that the deutsche börse offer - 530 pence per share , or nearly € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - is too high . " we think that this strategy compromises the long-term value of -lrb- deutsche börse , " atticus director david slager told the french newspaper la tribune in an article appearing friday .
" we are asking therefore the resignation of the current management and its replacement by one that would undertake a share buy-back . " deutsche börse has so far rejected atticus 's request for a special shareholder assembly to discuss the lse acquisition .
deutsche börse officials , having initially disdained shareholder unhappiness , have lately softened their tone .

german press reports have said deutsche börse shareholders who oppose or are critical of the lse bid control 30 percent of the frankfurt operator 's capital .
if a vote is taken in may at a regularly scheduled assembly they would need only to pass the 50 percent threshold to derail the project . in germany , there is also uneasiness at the prospect of transferring deutsche börse financial activities to london , which would deprive frankfurt of some of its stature .
on friday the regional government of hesse , which includes frankfurt , demanded to be heard . " we want more transparency , " regional finance minister karlheinz weimar told financial times deutschland newspaper . german media have also said that negotiations between the lse and british financial circles - the city - on the deutsche börse initiative have run into difficulties .
the city is reportedly demanding that the headquarters of a merged entity be transferred to london , which deutsche börse has so far rejected . under such circumstances , the chances of a hostile takeover aimed at the lse are growing , a development that deutsche börse head werner seifert declined to rule out last week . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt fears lse takeover as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal .

" two other funds , children 's investment fund management and atticus capital , each of which holds more than five percent in deutsche börse 's rival euronext , are also opposed , having determined that the deutsche börse offer - 530 pence per share , or nearly € 2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- - is too high . " we think that this strategy compromises the long-term value of -lrb- deutsche börse , " atticus director david slager told the french newspaper la tribune in an article appearing friday .
" we are asking therefore the resignation of the current management and its replacement by one that would undertake a share buy-back . " deutsche börse has so far rejected atticus 's request for a special shareholder assembly to discuss the lse acquisition .
deutsche börse officials , having initially disdained shareholder unhappiness , have lately softened their tone . " we are aware of the diverse opinions of our shareholders on the question of our offer for the london stock exchange and we are engaged in a dialogue with them , " said a deutsche börse spokesman . critical of the bid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will i have to move to london ?
german press reports have said deutsche börse shareholders who oppose or are critical of the lse bid control 30 percent of the frankfurt operator 's capital .
if a vote is taken in may at a regularly scheduled assembly they would need only to pass the 50 percent threshold to derail the project . in germany , there is also uneasiness at the prospect of transferring deutsche börse financial activities to london , which would deprive frankfurt of some of its stature .
on friday the regional government of hesse , which includes frankfurt , demanded to be heard . " we want more transparency , " regional finance minister karlheinz weimar told financial times deutschland newspaper . german media have also said that negotiations between the lse and british financial circles - the city - on the deutsche börse initiative have run into difficulties .
the city is reportedly demanding that the headquarters of a merged entity be transferred to london , which deutsche börse has so far rejected . under such circumstances , the chances of a hostile takeover aimed at the lse are growing , a development that deutsche börse head werner seifert declined to rule out last week . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de frankfurt fears lse takeover as deutsche börse presses ahead with plans to buy the london stock exchange , concern is growing in germany that frankfurt could lose out to the city as a financial center in the event of a deal .

l 'esquive earned a cesar prize for its director , tunisian-born abdellatif kechiche , and its young star , the 18-year-old actress sara forestier .
it saw off competition from big-budget french epic , a very long engagement , and the box-office hit , the chorus .
us film lost in translation won the award for best foreign feature .
the wistful romantic comedy directed by sofia coppola has already won several awards , including an oscar for best screenplay in 2004 .
its late release in france made it a contender for this year 's cesars .
amateur cast the low-budget l 'esquive depicts the travails of a group of youth getting ready to perform a school play by the 18th-century dramatist , marivaux .
the actors are mostly amateurs and the action is set in the impoverished suburbs of paris , home to thousands of immigrants from north africa and their children .
kechiche said he made the film because he " wanted to show people we do n't normally see at the cinema " .
a very long engagement , a world war i drama featuring audrey tautou , won five cesar awards .
the chorus , a film about a schoolteacher who introduces an unruly classroom to the pleasures of classical singing , won two awards - for best music and best sound .
us actor will smith , who won an honorary award at the ceremony , thanked his family and his " hero " , nelson mandela , in his speech .

ealing council says the move will stop damage the roots cause to houses and pavements .
but councillor nigel sumner says a promise to plant two new trees for every one cut down will prove to be even more costly .
ealing council says at the moment the plans are at a consultation stage and that nothing has been decided .
compensation payouts cllr sumner said : " there may be some bad trees whose roots are affecting pavements and property but i think there are only 50 or so - which is much less than 4,500 . "
a spokesman for the council said it spends £ 120,000 a year in maintenance and in paying out compensation to people who have tripped over damaged pavements and subsidence to houses .
the spokesman added : " this is tax payers money we are looking to save .
" these discussions are only proposals at this stage and no decision has been made despite claims to the contrary . "

the anti-smoking pact has been signed by 168 countries , and ratified by 57 of them , which will now have to tighten their anti-tobacco laws .
the treaty demands health warnings on cigarette packets and bans on tobacco advertising within five years .
every year five million people die from smoking-related diseases - a number set to double by 2020 if nothing is done .
so the world health organization has designed the fctc to force countries to implement stricter tobacco legislation .
dr douglas bettcher , the co-ordinator of the fctc unit , explained why the world needed binding international law on tobacco : key requirements of treaty ban tobacco advertising , sponsorship and promotion , where constitutions allow , within five years tobacco packaging must include health warnings covering at least 30 % of packet within 3 years introduce measures to protect people from second-hand tobacco smoke in public places draw up strategies to combat smuggling adopt tax policies which discourage smoking analysis : kyoto with teeth " the world community was faced and appalled by the mushrooming number of needless deaths due to tobacco-related diseases .

the 57 countries that have agreed to be bound to the fctc will only be able to sell cigarettes with health warnings on packets .
within five years they will have to ban tobacco advertising , promotion and sponsorship , as well as reducing exposure to second-hand smoke - basically banning smoking in public places .
the industry had initially opposed the treaty but dr chris procter of british american tobacco says that on the whole it is a good thing : " there 's a fair will in the international community to make the framework convention work .
