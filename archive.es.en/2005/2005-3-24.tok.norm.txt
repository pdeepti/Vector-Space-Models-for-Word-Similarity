program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .
and until new legislation comes into effect , the 12,000 comatose patients in germany who could theoretically recover one day will be kept alive at all costs . judith hartl -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

this village of 3,500 people boasts of being the birthplace of " nanus hortorum vulgaris " , or the common garden gnome , which local folklore says was dreamed up by a local potter in 1880 . the craftsmen of the village , including reinhard 's great-grandfather , wasted no time in capitalizing on the idea and , in the land where the brothers grimm created snow white and the seven dwarfs , the popularity of gnomes spread fast . " with his red hat , his lantern , his wheelbarrow and his basket on his back , he is the very image of the miners who used to work in this region , " reinhard said .
" he 's small enough to worm through the mineshafts and always full of the joys of life . " illegal under communism for reinhard , the reign of the gnomes reached a low point in the days when the communist regime in east germany banned them because they were considered a capitalist symbol , although they were happy to export them to the west in return for hard cash . since the mines shut down in this region , gnome manufacture has become the lifeblood of the village .
and there is no shortage of work - reinhard estimates there are more than 18 million garden gnomes in germany alone , 30 of which grace his garden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard has no time for the plastic imitations - for him , it should be a proper , handmade gnome , or nothing .
with the help of his wife iris and his assistant , he fashions the jolly little figures by hand and gives them names , be it fritz , heinz , or willy .
reinhard can identify each batch by their face , height or what they are doing - fishing , dozing or even playing cards . some are a lot naughtier than that - one of reinhard 's top sellers is a mischievous ' voyeur gnome ' with binoculars raised to his eyes and his trousers round his ankles , available to the more adventurous gardener for 34 euros -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slumbers in fairy time warp fighting for the rights of ceramic garden gnomes might sound downright bizarre .

" still echoes around erfurt and now in red lake on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago . the latest school shooting in the united states brought back some very painful memories for the people of erfurt , germany . monday 's killings at the red lake high school in minnesota in which 16-year-old jeff weise shot and killed 10 people , including himself , reopened emotional wounds which have yet to heal in the small german town , the scene of one of europe 's bloodiest school massacre three years ago . erfurt ’ s mayor manfred ruge was amongst the first to express his condolences to the victims and their relatives when the news about the shootings in minnesota became known . erfurt 's mayor offers advice from the heart ruge had first hand experience of such a tragedy when , in april 2002 , robert steinhäuser , who had been expelled from the erfurt 's gutenberg high school , killed twelve teachers , a secretary , two students , a police officer and himself .
from the mayor 's own experience three years ago , ruge made it clear that attention is what the people in red lake now need most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering the erfurt tragedy " i would recommend to the administration of red lake : listen to the families .
listen to what they need , " erfurt 's mayor told reporters .
" don ’ t just stay in contact with them : seek out contact with them . because only when people listen to each other , and give courage to each other to express their feelings , then can they help each other . " in their shock three years ago , many germans said publicly that while this sort of thing happens in america , it shouldn ’ t happen here , citing europe 's tighter gun control laws . now following red lake , european editorial writers have turned on the bush administration for not curbing gun ownership .
but mayor ruge doesn ’ t agree . strict gun laws ca n't stop the determined " there ’ s an official statistic in germany which suggests that at least two-thirds of weapons owned by citizens here are illegal . this is a social problem . a large number of germans can get a weapon when they want one , " ruge said . he is convinced that such killings could happen in germany again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floral tributes in erfurt " many of my colleagues made clear that in their school , there have been violence and threats . it just never got to the point where a student killed so many other students and teachers .
in germany , violence in schools is a daily problem . " indeed , in july 2003 , the unthinkable almost happened again .
a 16-year-old boy at a school in the bavarian town of coburg died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of the erfurt school shooting a year before . according to witnesses at the time , the coburg pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , who stood just a few meters in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial outside the coburg school unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as a school counselor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself . school killings not just us phenomenon north america and europe are not the only continents affected by school murders .
in the last year alone , there have been six incidents reported in china .
nine people in total were killed in the attacks which were carried out with knives .
the total would have been a lot higher had the assailants had the same access to guns as those in the us and germany . erik campano -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

" there will be no trial anymore as mr -lrb- heinrich -rrb- gross is not mentally able to stand trial , " justice ministry spokesman michael standl told afp .

" the fate of the jews in nazi germany should be studied in a much broader context .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing .

the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .

" the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .

" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .

this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .
" people should ask their tax office for an explanation if they receive notices from the bank .

the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .
at another holy thursday ceremony in milan 's duomo , cardinal dionigi tettamanzi paid tribute to john paul ii 's " strong and moving " faith .
" we assure the pope , once again , of our prayers and affection . " on the sidelines the ravages of recent illness , old age and parkinson 's disease has forced the pontiff to take a largely peripheral role in this year 's ceremonies for easter holy week , the most solemn of the church calendar when christians commemorate the passion , crucifixion and resurrection of christ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger but one of the vatican 's most senior prelates , cardinal joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , said that despite his struggle with illness , john paul ii was continuing to lead the world 's 1.1 billion catholics with " absolute lucidity . " " that is also a gift of god considering the physical challenges that john paul ii faces , " cardinal joseph ratzinger told rai television in an interview . ratzinger , the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said the pope 's mind " is alive and there is possibly an even stronger discernment . "
john paul ii has retained " the capacity to choose the essential and to govern , while suffering , with few but crucial decisions , " said raztinger , who will fill in for the absent pope at the way of the cross ceremony on friday . the pope has always been capable of taking the fundamental decisions , the cardinal added , although he " has certainly revised his activities .

experts say german history lessons are skewed , giving too much weight to the holocaust and failing to teach kids about the rich heritage of german jewry , in which jews were much more than merely the nazis ' victims . germany is socially , culturally and economically poorer since the nazi 's reign of terror killed or chased away most of the country 's jews .

experts say german history lessons are skewed , giving too much weight to the holocaust and failing to teach kids about the rich heritage of german jewry , in which jews were much more than merely the nazis ' victims . germany is socially , culturally and economically poorer since the nazi 's reign of terror killed or chased away most of the country 's jews .
experts agree that school kids do n't know that because they receive a one-sided view of jews as having been little more than the persecuted victims of german history .
they never get wind of the fact that jews contributed vastly to german society .
and it 's something that some people are trying to change . " in german school books and classes there is a sole emphasis on the years of the holocaust , between 1933 and 1945 , " said frankfurt jewish museum director georg heuberger .
" the fate of the jews in nazi germany should be studied in a much broader context .
it should be integrated in 2,000 years of history of the jews in germany . " heuberger was part of an illustrious panel commissioned by the leo baeck institute -lrb- lbi -rrb- , an international organization devoted to the study of german jewry , to draft guidelines to ensure that pupils learn that jews have played a fundamental - and positive - role in european and german culture .
with support from germany 's largest teachers ' union , the gew , and the association of history teachers in germany , the lbi has launched a campaign to convince educational authorities , schoolbook publishers and teacher trainers to change their methods . germany without einstein ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moses mendelssohn -lrb- 1729-1786 -rrb- german culture would be unthinkable without the contributions of jews of the german-speaking world , including enlightenment-age philosopher moses mendelssohn , poet heinrich heine , physicists albert einstein and lise meitner , composer arnold schönberg , filmmaker fritz lang , philosopher hannah arendt and marlene dietrich 's longtime songwriter , friedrich hollaender . silvia haslauer has been teaching history and german at jules verne comprehensive school in berlin 's hellersdorf district since 2002 .
her wards are between 17 and 19 years old , when students prepare for and take germany 's grueling final exams to earn their ticket to university , the abitur .
haslauer said that teachers and their trainers are indeed sensitive to the problem of ensuring pupils receive a differentiated view of german-jewish history . " already in teacher training we examined the problem of jews only being presented in the role of victims , " haslauer explained .
her instructor stressed the merits of field trips to teach kids about german-jewish history .
" we dealt with it through excursions . " haslauer takes her pupils on school trips to concentration camps , synagogues and jewish cemeteries .
she says that especially going to auschwitz is productive , because there " kids see that there was much more than just persecution . "
in school , they also learn about jews in other eras of german history , during medieval times and as german soldiers in world war i , she said . gradual change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz but haslauer pointed out that it 's up to teachers to choose what topics to emphasize , at least in the capital 's schools .
while she feels she has the freedom to make sure german-jewish history is taught , she said changes will have to be made when the centralized abitur , already in effect in nine other states , is introduced in berlin in 2007 .
then , instead of individual teachers deciding what topics their students will be tested on , a central authority will determine the subjects for all final exam-takers . haslauer may be in a better position to address the issue of teaching german-jewish history than her colleagues , since she 's already sensitive to the issue herself and has more space to influence what her students learn than in other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , heuberger and the lbi commission certainly believe there are glaring discrepancies that still need to be addressed .
" young people have to understand that the jews were not strangers in germany , foreigners like some of the minorities that live in germany today . "
and he stressed that german jewry should n't only be considered in the past tense , disregarding the fact that hundreds of thousands of jews live here again . but heuberger is positive that improvements will be made over time .
" the change is gradual , but we were already sent a new school book last week .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing .

the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .

over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .

in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .
at another holy thursday ceremony in milan 's duomo , cardinal dionigi tettamanzi paid tribute to john paul ii 's " strong and moving " faith .
" we assure the pope , once again , of our prayers and affection . " on the sidelines the ravages of recent illness , old age and parkinson 's disease has forced the pontiff to take a largely peripheral role in this year 's ceremonies for easter holy week , the most solemn of the church calendar when christians commemorate the passion , crucifixion and resurrection of christ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger but one of the vatican 's most senior prelates , cardinal joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , said that despite his struggle with illness , john paul ii was continuing to lead the world 's 1.1 billion catholics with " absolute lucidity . " " that is also a gift of god considering the physical challenges that john paul ii faces , " cardinal joseph ratzinger told rai television in an interview . ratzinger , the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said the pope 's mind " is alive and there is possibly an even stronger discernment . "
john paul ii has retained " the capacity to choose the essential and to govern , while suffering , with few but crucial decisions , " said raztinger , who will fill in for the absent pope at the way of the cross ceremony on friday . the pope has always been capable of taking the fundamental decisions , the cardinal added , although he " has certainly revised his activities . "
the frail 84-year-old pontiff has not spoken in public since march 13 , when he was discharged from hospital after a throat operation . delegation the pope , who suffers from parkinson 's disease , has had to delegate all ceremonies this easter to his cardinals , except the urbi et orbi -lrb- to rome and to the world -rrb- blessing on sunday when he traditionally blessed the faithful in some 60 languages . cardinal angelo scola said not participating in friday 's way of the cross " was certainly a great sacrifice " for the pope .
scola , who is considered a possible successor to pope john paul ii , said that although the pontiff could not be among the faithful physically , " in a certain sense he will be with them in an even more powerful way . " " this is the great mystery of the church , " said scola , who is patriarch of venice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii waves as he leaves rome 's polyclinic agostino gemelli hospital aboard his popemobile , thursday , feb .

for one thing , he has resisted allowing her to get the proper rehabilitation she has needed since 1991 .
truth is , nobody knows what could happen to her because she has n't recieved the proper rehabilitation yet .
she is still alive and a young woman too ! !
she has a chance and it is absolutely barbaric to starve her to death !
the process of starvation is horrific and gruesome .
i am absolutely disgusted with what 's going on right now .
her husband has moved on to a new woman and a new family , and he will gain a substantial amount of money from her death .
this is sick and i for one , am on the verge of vomitting at the thought of it .
please , people , do n't base your opinion on whether or not you believe she should live in this state of being ; base your decision on terri 's case alone : after knowing the facts of her case , who should be able to decide her fate , her husband or her parents ? - julie h. usa no , i do not think her husband has a right since he is living with another women and has two children . i only believe the parents have the legal right but this should have been done when he left his vow of marriage . - catherine moreland i am quite saddened to the see the amount of attention this case is getting in the global media .
we do n't care about thousands of people including children dying of hunger everyday , and at the same time , we have no qualms talking a lot about a single human being who has been in coma for the last several years !
regardless of how iteresting philosophically this case is , do n't you think it is unfair to discuss this at such a great length , when there are clearly more pressing issues that the media should talk about ? - ram natarajan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

he is living in a common-law relationship with another woman and has had children with her .
three months after receiving $ 700,000 usd in a malpractice suit against terri 's doctors that was supposed to pay for her rehabilitation needs , he ordered doctors to stop any therapy . - andrew jezierski he is n't " helping " her to die , he 's fulfilling her wish as verbally expressed to him within the covenant of their marriage -lrb- from what i understand , florida law allows him to make end-of-life decisions regarding his spouse -rrb- as a normally republican voting american , i find the intervention of the congress a cynical attempt to placate the religious right . - eric rhyne , usa i think the term " allowing her to die " masks what is happening - terri is being starved and dehydrated to death .
there has been little attempt at rehabilitation although her husband promised to use the money terri was awarded to do this .
her parents are willing to look after her and her husband can get on with his life with his new partner and his two children by her .
there have been numerous cases of people who have awoken from so called pvs .
in france the editor of elle , jean- dominique bauby , wrote a book about his life after a massive stroke left him completely paralysed except for being able to blink an eyelid .
pvs is a term used to dehumanise a person so that s / he can be killed . - janet secluna thomas , u.k. i know that if anything like this should happen in my family we would probably take a lot of time before we allowed the injured person to die .
i personally would say yes and let the person die .
better than to see her or him living on tubes . - florina gheorghiu , romania i live in san francisco , california , and i absolutely feel that ms. schiavo 's parents should decide her fate , not her husband !
for one thing , he has resisted allowing her to get the proper rehabilitation she has needed since 1991 .
truth is , nobody knows what could happen to her because she has n't recieved the proper rehabilitation yet .
she is still alive and a young woman too ! !
she has a chance and it is absolutely barbaric to starve her to death !
the process of starvation is horrific and gruesome .
i am absolutely disgusted with what 's going on right now .
her husband has moved on to a new woman and a new family , and he will gain a substantial amount of money from her death .
this is sick and i for one , am on the verge of vomitting at the thought of it .
please , people , do n't base your opinion on whether or not you believe she should live in this state of being ; base your decision on terri 's case alone : after knowing the facts of her case , who should be able to decide her fate , her husband or her parents ? - julie h. usa no , i do not think her husband has a right since he is living with another women and has two children . i only believe the parents have the legal right but this should have been done when he left his vow of marriage . - catherine moreland i am quite saddened to the see the amount of attention this case is getting in the global media .
we do n't care about thousands of people including children dying of hunger everyday , and at the same time , we have no qualms talking a lot about a single human being who has been in coma for the last several years !
regardless of how iteresting philosophically this case is , do n't you think it is unfair to discuss this at such a great length , when there are clearly more pressing issues that the media should talk about ? - ram natarajan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

please , people , do n't base your opinion on whether or not you believe she should live in this state of being ; base your decision on terri 's case alone : after knowing the facts of her case , who should be able to decide her fate , her husband or her parents ? - julie h. usa no , i do not think her husband has a right since he is living with another women and has two children . i only believe the parents have the legal right but this should have been done when he left his vow of marriage . - catherine moreland i am quite saddened to the see the amount of attention this case is getting in the global media .
we do n't care about thousands of people including children dying of hunger everyday , and at the same time , we have no qualms talking a lot about a single human being who has been in coma for the last several years !

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .

" we assure the pope , once again , of our prayers and affection .

" " that is also a gift of god considering the physical challenges that john paul ii faces , " cardinal joseph ratzinger told rai television in an interview . ratzinger , the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said the pope 's mind " is alive and there is possibly an even stronger discernment . "
john paul ii has retained " the capacity to choose the essential and to govern , while suffering , with few but crucial decisions , " said raztinger , who will fill in for the absent pope at the way of the cross ceremony on friday . the pope has always been capable of taking the fundamental decisions , the cardinal added , although he " has certainly revised his activities . "
the frail 84-year-old pontiff has not spoken in public since march 13 , when he was discharged from hospital after a throat operation . delegation the pope , who suffers from parkinson 's disease , has had to delegate all ceremonies this easter to his cardinals , except the urbi et orbi -lrb- to rome and to the world -rrb- blessing on sunday when he traditionally blessed the faithful in some 60 languages . cardinal angelo scola said not participating in friday 's way of the cross " was certainly a great sacrifice " for the pope .
scola , who is considered a possible successor to pope john paul ii , said that although the pontiff could not be among the faithful physically , " in a certain sense he will be with them in an even more powerful way . " " this is the great mystery of the church , " said scola , who is patriarch of venice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii waves as he leaves rome 's polyclinic agostino gemelli hospital aboard his popemobile , thursday , feb .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

" the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .

" we assure the pope , once again , of our prayers and affection . " on the sidelines the ravages of recent illness , old age and parkinson 's disease has forced the pontiff to take a largely peripheral role in this year 's ceremonies for easter holy week , the most solemn of the church calendar when christians commemorate the passion , crucifixion and resurrection of christ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger but one of the vatican 's most senior prelates , cardinal joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , said that despite his struggle with illness , john paul ii was continuing to lead the world 's 1.1 billion catholics with " absolute lucidity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.03.2005 law allows officials to access bank details großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of april 1 , bank account details can be provided to tax offices a decision by germany 's highest court wednesday allowed tax and welfare offices to peek into citizens ' bank accounts if they suspect fraud or tax evasion .
critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .
" people should ask their tax office for an explanation if they receive notices from the bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .
" people should ask their tax office for an explanation if they receive notices from the bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .
and until new legislation comes into effect , the 12,000 comatose patients in germany who could theoretically recover one day will be kept alive at all costs . judith hartl -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?
now , officials believe that schröder was informed about massive irregularities as early as 2000 , with copies of letters in which the interior minister challenged the visa regulations and the foreign minister defended them .
a foreign ministry spokesman denied that schröder had the letters . but ulrich von klaeden , who represents the opposition conservative christian democrats in the parliamentary inquiry commission isn ’ t willing to let the chancellor off the hook : " i take it that gerhard schroeder himself knew about the discrepancies , " he said .
" a conflict of this magnitude between the foreign and interior ministries can ’ t possibly have escaped the chancellor ’ s notice . ” fischer takes responsibility fischer has reluctantly assumed responsibility for the affair .
but he has refused to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer “ i admit that between 2000 and 2002 and did not react fast enough to reports about the abuse of our new visa-issuing policy , " he said .
" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .
we want to speed up our work , as it seems in the interest of all to shed more light into the affair .
and certainly we are interested in hearing the foreign minister himself as soon as possible . ” praise for prosecutor meanwhile opposition leaders have been praising the man who brought the scandal to light .
they are even suggesting a national award of merit for prosecutor egbert buelles .
he brought a ukrainian man to trial who was accused trafficking in human cargo a year ago - buelles blamed the foreign ministry as being responsible for helping human traffickers by facilitating the influx of illegal workers and prostitutes . the cdu opposition now says the prosecutor acted under enormous pressure when he continued to press claims that government officials were hindering the investigation by dragging their feet over presenting documents and witnesses . tona dunham -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .

"
john paul ii has retained " the capacity to choose the essential and to govern , while suffering , with few but crucial decisions , " said raztinger , who will fill in for the absent pope at the way of the cross ceremony on friday . the pope has always been capable of taking the fundamental decisions , the cardinal added , although he " has certainly revised his activities . "
the frail 84-year-old pontiff has not spoken in public since march 13 , when he was discharged from hospital after a throat operation . delegation the pope , who suffers from parkinson 's disease , has had to delegate all ceremonies this easter to his cardinals , except the urbi et orbi -lrb- to rome and to the world -rrb- blessing on sunday when he traditionally blessed the faithful in some 60 languages . cardinal angelo scola said not participating in friday 's way of the cross " was certainly a great sacrifice " for the pope .
scola , who is considered a possible successor to pope john paul ii , said that although the pontiff could not be among the faithful physically , " in a certain sense he will be with them in an even more powerful way .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .

" we assure the pope , once again , of our prayers and affection . " on the sidelines the ravages of recent illness , old age and parkinson 's disease has forced the pontiff to take a largely peripheral role in this year 's ceremonies for easter holy week , the most solemn of the church calendar when christians commemorate the passion , crucifixion and resurrection of christ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger but one of the vatican 's most senior prelates , cardinal joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , said that despite his struggle with illness , john paul ii was continuing to lead the world 's 1.1 billion catholics with " absolute lucidity . " " that is also a gift of god considering the physical challenges that john paul ii faces , " cardinal joseph ratzinger told rai television in an interview . ratzinger , the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said the pope 's mind " is alive and there is possibly an even stronger discernment . "
john paul ii has retained " the capacity to choose the essential and to govern , while suffering , with few but crucial decisions , " said raztinger , who will fill in for the absent pope at the way of the cross ceremony on friday . the pope has always been capable of taking the fundamental decisions , the cardinal added , although he " has certainly revised his activities . "
the frail 84-year-old pontiff has not spoken in public since march 13 , when he was discharged from hospital after a throat operation . delegation the pope , who suffers from parkinson 's disease , has had to delegate all ceremonies this easter to his cardinals , except the urbi et orbi -lrb- to rome and to the world -rrb- blessing on sunday when he traditionally blessed the faithful in some 60 languages . cardinal angelo scola said not participating in friday 's way of the cross " was certainly a great sacrifice " for the pope .
scola , who is considered a possible successor to pope john paul ii , said that although the pontiff could not be among the faithful physically , " in a certain sense he will be with them in an even more powerful way . " " this is the great mystery of the church , " said scola , who is patriarch of venice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii waves as he leaves rome 's polyclinic agostino gemelli hospital aboard his popemobile , thursday , feb .

and it 's something that some people are trying to change . " in german school books and classes there is a sole emphasis on the years of the holocaust , between 1933 and 1945 , " said frankfurt jewish museum director georg heuberger .
" the fate of the jews in nazi germany should be studied in a much broader context .
it should be integrated in 2,000 years of history of the jews in germany .

then , instead of individual teachers deciding what topics their students will be tested on , a central authority will determine the subjects for all final exam-takers . haslauer may be in a better position to address the issue of teaching german-jewish history than her colleagues , since she 's already sensitive to the issue herself and has more space to influence what her students learn than in other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , heuberger and the lbi commission certainly believe there are glaring discrepancies that still need to be addressed .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?
now , officials believe that schröder was informed about massive irregularities as early as 2000 , with copies of letters in which the interior minister challenged the visa regulations and the foreign minister defended them .
a foreign ministry spokesman denied that schröder had the letters . but ulrich von klaeden , who represents the opposition conservative christian democrats in the parliamentary inquiry commission isn ’ t willing to let the chancellor off the hook : " i take it that gerhard schroeder himself knew about the discrepancies , " he said .
" a conflict of this magnitude between the foreign and interior ministries can ’ t possibly have escaped the chancellor ’ s notice . ” fischer takes responsibility fischer has reluctantly assumed responsibility for the affair .
but he has refused to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer “ i admit that between 2000 and 2002 and did not react fast enough to reports about the abuse of our new visa-issuing policy , " he said .
" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .
we want to speed up our work , as it seems in the interest of all to shed more light into the affair .
and certainly we are interested in hearing the foreign minister himself as soon as possible . ” praise for prosecutor meanwhile opposition leaders have been praising the man who brought the scandal to light .
they are even suggesting a national award of merit for prosecutor egbert buelles .
he brought a ukrainian man to trial who was accused trafficking in human cargo a year ago - buelles blamed the foreign ministry as being responsible for helping human traffickers by facilitating the influx of illegal workers and prostitutes . the cdu opposition now says the prosecutor acted under enormous pressure when he continued to press claims that government officials were hindering the investigation by dragging their feet over presenting documents and witnesses . tona dunham -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

" still echoes around erfurt and now in red lake on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago . the latest school shooting in the united states brought back some very painful memories for the people of erfurt , germany . monday 's killings at the red lake high school in minnesota in which 16-year-old jeff weise shot and killed 10 people , including himself , reopened emotional wounds which have yet to heal in the small german town , the scene of one of europe 's bloodiest school massacre three years ago . erfurt ’ s mayor manfred ruge was amongst the first to express his condolences to the victims and their relatives when the news about the shootings in minnesota became known . erfurt 's mayor offers advice from the heart ruge had first hand experience of such a tragedy when , in april 2002 , robert steinhäuser , who had been expelled from the erfurt 's gutenberg high school , killed twelve teachers , a secretary , two students , a police officer and himself .
from the mayor 's own experience three years ago , ruge made it clear that attention is what the people in red lake now need most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering the erfurt tragedy " i would recommend to the administration of red lake : listen to the families .
listen to what they need , " erfurt 's mayor told reporters .
" don ’ t just stay in contact with them : seek out contact with them . because only when people listen to each other , and give courage to each other to express their feelings , then can they help each other .

" still echoes around erfurt and now in red lake on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago . the latest school shooting in the united states brought back some very painful memories for the people of erfurt , germany . monday 's killings at the red lake high school in minnesota in which 16-year-old jeff weise shot and killed 10 people , including himself , reopened emotional wounds which have yet to heal in the small german town , the scene of one of europe 's bloodiest school massacre three years ago . erfurt ’ s mayor manfred ruge was amongst the first to express his condolences to the victims and their relatives when the news about the shootings in minnesota became known . erfurt 's mayor offers advice from the heart ruge had first hand experience of such a tragedy when , in april 2002 , robert steinhäuser , who had been expelled from the erfurt 's gutenberg high school , killed twelve teachers , a secretary , two students , a police officer and himself .
from the mayor 's own experience three years ago , ruge made it clear that attention is what the people in red lake now need most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering the erfurt tragedy " i would recommend to the administration of red lake : listen to the families .
listen to what they need , " erfurt 's mayor told reporters .
" don ’ t just stay in contact with them : seek out contact with them . because only when people listen to each other , and give courage to each other to express their feelings , then can they help each other . " in their shock three years ago , many germans said publicly that while this sort of thing happens in america , it shouldn ’ t happen here , citing europe 's tighter gun control laws . now following red lake , european editorial writers have turned on the bush administration for not curbing gun ownership .
but mayor ruge doesn ’ t agree . strict gun laws ca n't stop the determined " there ’ s an official statistic in germany which suggests that at least two-thirds of weapons owned by citizens here are illegal . this is a social problem . a large number of germans can get a weapon when they want one , " ruge said . he is convinced that such killings could happen in germany again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floral tributes in erfurt " many of my colleagues made clear that in their school , there have been violence and threats . it just never got to the point where a student killed so many other students and teachers .
in germany , violence in schools is a daily problem . " indeed , in july 2003 , the unthinkable almost happened again .
a 16-year-old boy at a school in the bavarian town of coburg died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of the erfurt school shooting a year before . according to witnesses at the time , the coburg pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , who stood just a few meters in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial outside the coburg school unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as a school counselor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself . school killings not just us phenomenon north america and europe are not the only continents affected by school murders .
in the last year alone , there have been six incidents reported in china .
nine people in total were killed in the attacks which were carried out with knives .
the total would have been a lot higher had the assailants had the same access to guns as those in the us and germany . erik campano -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?

" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?
now , officials believe that schröder was informed about massive irregularities as early as 2000 , with copies of letters in which the interior minister challenged the visa regulations and the foreign minister defended them .
a foreign ministry spokesman denied that schröder had the letters . but ulrich von klaeden , who represents the opposition conservative christian democrats in the parliamentary inquiry commission isn ’ t willing to let the chancellor off the hook : " i take it that gerhard schroeder himself knew about the discrepancies , " he said .

" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .
we want to speed up our work , as it seems in the interest of all to shed more light into the affair .
and certainly we are interested in hearing the foreign minister himself as soon as possible . ” praise for prosecutor meanwhile opposition leaders have been praising the man who brought the scandal to light .
they are even suggesting a national award of merit for prosecutor egbert buelles .
he brought a ukrainian man to trial who was accused trafficking in human cargo a year ago - buelles blamed the foreign ministry as being responsible for helping human traffickers by facilitating the influx of illegal workers and prostitutes . the cdu opposition now says the prosecutor acted under enormous pressure when he continued to press claims that government officials were hindering the investigation by dragging their feet over presenting documents and witnesses . tona dunham -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .

" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .

legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .
and until new legislation comes into effect , the 12,000 comatose patients in germany who could theoretically recover one day will be kept alive at all costs . judith hartl -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .
and until new legislation comes into effect , the 12,000 comatose patients in germany who could theoretically recover one day will be kept alive at all costs . judith hartl -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .
at another holy thursday ceremony in milan 's duomo , cardinal dionigi tettamanzi paid tribute to john paul ii 's " strong and moving " faith .
" we assure the pope , once again , of our prayers and affection . " on the sidelines the ravages of recent illness , old age and parkinson 's disease has forced the pontiff to take a largely peripheral role in this year 's ceremonies for easter holy week , the most solemn of the church calendar when christians commemorate the passion , crucifixion and resurrection of christ . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german cardinal joseph ratzinger but one of the vatican 's most senior prelates , cardinal joseph ratzinger -lrb- photo -rrb- , said that despite his struggle with illness , john paul ii was continuing to lead the world 's 1.1 billion catholics with " absolute lucidity . " " that is also a gift of god considering the physical challenges that john paul ii faces , " cardinal joseph ratzinger told rai television in an interview . ratzinger , the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said the pope 's mind " is alive and there is possibly an even stronger discernment . "
john paul ii has retained " the capacity to choose the essential and to govern , while suffering , with few but crucial decisions , " said raztinger , who will fill in for the absent pope at the way of the cross ceremony on friday . the pope has always been capable of taking the fundamental decisions , the cardinal added , although he " has certainly revised his activities . "
the frail 84-year-old pontiff has not spoken in public since march 13 , when he was discharged from hospital after a throat operation . delegation the pope , who suffers from parkinson 's disease , has had to delegate all ceremonies this easter to his cardinals , except the urbi et orbi -lrb- to rome and to the world -rrb- blessing on sunday when he traditionally blessed the faithful in some 60 languages . cardinal angelo scola said not participating in friday 's way of the cross " was certainly a great sacrifice " for the pope .
scola , who is considered a possible successor to pope john paul ii , said that although the pontiff could not be among the faithful physically , " in a certain sense he will be with them in an even more powerful way . " " this is the great mystery of the church , " said scola , who is patriarch of venice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii waves as he leaves rome 's polyclinic agostino gemelli hospital aboard his popemobile , thursday , feb .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .

the news weekly said the man , identified as an iraqi national named hassan al-sajdi , had claimed in a hostage-style video tape sent to the offices of the us magazine time that he was working for an unnamed german media company .
the man , who had lived for some time in germany , was pictured holding a document believed to be an expired german rail card , spiegel said .
it said the hostage takers , who go by the name of " the protectors of islam brigade , " had also demanded that the german government sever ties with the iraqi authorities .
sources close to the government in berlin said that the man was almost certainly not a german citizen and that its embassy in baghdad had been alerted and was looking into the incident .
spiegel said sajdi had returned to his homeland a few months ago but that he had come to the attention of the german authorities for his links to a group of iraqis in exile who stormed iraq 's embassy in berlin in august 2002 .
iraq has been plagued by repeated hostage-takings of foreigners and locals since the us-led war launched two years ago to remove the former dictator saddam hussein .
some hostages have been released , many of them for ransom , while others have been executed .
the fates of several remain unknown . dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever . "

hans-otto schiemann , 54 , who claims to be infected with hiv and had unprotected sex with hundreds of thais , was arrested wednesday in chaiyaphum province , three days after re-entering the country through thailand 's main international airport despite being blacklisted .
he is under detention at immigration in bangkok awaiting deportation , " chaiyaphum police lieutenant colonel kampol nonuch told afp .
" he can not be in thailand , as he was listed as persona non grata . "
kampol said schiemann , a army veteran , was deported from thailand march 14 for overstaying his 30-day visa .
he was blacklisted friday march 18 , but his name was not put into the immigration office 's computer until march 21 , one day after schiemann re-entered the kingdom .
police hoped schiemann would now be permanently barred from entering the country , but a deportation date had yet to be set .
the officials said the scale of the problem was not clear , with many women reluctant to come forward for an aids test , but said schiemann could have had sex with up to 400 women and teenage girls .
thailand has no law allowing action against people who knowingly infect someone with hiv .
schiemann refused to take a blood test since being picked up by the authorities in early october .
while in custody , he told afp in chaiyaphum that he had contracted hiv three years ago and was " like heroin to girls . " dw-world.de german detained in thai hiv scare a german at the center of an hiv scare involving potentially hundreds of thai women and girls was detained by a court monday for overstaying his visa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.03.2005 law allows officials to access bank details großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of april 1 , bank account details can be provided to tax offices a decision by germany 's highest court wednesday allowed tax and welfare offices to peek into citizens ' bank accounts if they suspect fraud or tax evasion .
critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .

banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .
" people should ask their tax office for an explanation if they receive notices from the bank .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing .

over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing .

the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .

over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

" the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

here dw-world readers have their say . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this situation is very sad .
terri 's husband has the right to remove her feeding tube .
written and legal documents are available to eliminate this situation .
bush and his politicians are wrong in what they have done .
they are using this sad case to get the right for life people , religous groups and the roman catholic groups on their republican party side ! !
the government does not have the right to intervene in these matters .
my wife and i are retired and live in florida now , in the us . i am sad and angry over the government messing with this situation for political gains .
it 's so phony . - dan droege , usa nutrition and hydration are basics for a human being .
none should have the right to discontinue it .
there is a possibility that she could swallow liquid food and water . she is not in a coma and is able to interact with others .
in addition , in the case of terri schiavo there are enough suspect circumstances to show that her husband has a conflict of interest in this case .
terri 's bone scan shows long term trauma that indicates possibility of domestic violence .
there is a nurse 's affadavit that michael schiavo admitted not to knowing terri 's wishes .
he is living in a common-law relationship with another woman and has had children with her .
three months after receiving $ 700,000 usd in a malpractice suit against terri 's doctors that was supposed to pay for her rehabilitation needs , he ordered doctors to stop any therapy . - andrew jezierski he is n't " helping " her to die , he 's fulfilling her wish as verbally expressed to him within the covenant of their marriage -lrb- from what i understand , florida law allows him to make end-of-life decisions regarding his spouse -rrb- as a normally republican voting american , i find the intervention of the congress a cynical attempt to placate the religious right . - eric rhyne , usa i think the term " allowing her to die " masks what is happening - terri is being starved and dehydrated to death .
there has been little attempt at rehabilitation although her husband promised to use the money terri was awarded to do this .
her parents are willing to look after her and her husband can get on with his life with his new partner and his two children by her .
there have been numerous cases of people who have awoken from so called pvs .
in france the editor of elle , jean- dominique bauby , wrote a book about his life after a massive stroke left him completely paralysed except for being able to blink an eyelid .
pvs is a term used to dehumanise a person so that s / he can be killed . - janet secluna thomas , u.k. i know that if anything like this should happen in my family we would probably take a lot of time before we allowed the injured person to die .
i personally would say yes and let the person die .
better than to see her or him living on tubes . - florina gheorghiu , romania i live in san francisco , california , and i absolutely feel that ms. schiavo 's parents should decide her fate , not her husband !
for one thing , he has resisted allowing her to get the proper rehabilitation she has needed since 1991 .
truth is , nobody knows what could happen to her because she has n't recieved the proper rehabilitation yet .
she is still alive and a young woman too ! !

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .
and until new legislation comes into effect , the 12,000 comatose patients in germany who could theoretically recover one day will be kept alive at all costs . judith hartl -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?
now , officials believe that schröder was informed about massive irregularities as early as 2000 , with copies of letters in which the interior minister challenged the visa regulations and the foreign minister defended them .
a foreign ministry spokesman denied that schröder had the letters . but ulrich von klaeden , who represents the opposition conservative christian democrats in the parliamentary inquiry commission isn ’ t willing to let the chancellor off the hook : " i take it that gerhard schroeder himself knew about the discrepancies , " he said .
" a conflict of this magnitude between the foreign and interior ministries can ’ t possibly have escaped the chancellor ’ s notice . ” fischer takes responsibility fischer has reluctantly assumed responsibility for the affair .
but he has refused to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer “ i admit that between 2000 and 2002 and did not react fast enough to reports about the abuse of our new visa-issuing policy , " he said .
" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .
we want to speed up our work , as it seems in the interest of all to shed more light into the affair .
and certainly we are interested in hearing the foreign minister himself as soon as possible . ” praise for prosecutor meanwhile opposition leaders have been praising the man who brought the scandal to light .
they are even suggesting a national award of merit for prosecutor egbert buelles .
he brought a ukrainian man to trial who was accused trafficking in human cargo a year ago - buelles blamed the foreign ministry as being responsible for helping human traffickers by facilitating the influx of illegal workers and prostitutes . the cdu opposition now says the prosecutor acted under enormous pressure when he continued to press claims that government officials were hindering the investigation by dragging their feet over presenting documents and witnesses . tona dunham -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?
now , officials believe that schröder was informed about massive irregularities as early as 2000 , with copies of letters in which the interior minister challenged the visa regulations and the foreign minister defended them .
a foreign ministry spokesman denied that schröder had the letters . but ulrich von klaeden , who represents the opposition conservative christian democrats in the parliamentary inquiry commission isn ’ t willing to let the chancellor off the hook : " i take it that gerhard schroeder himself knew about the discrepancies , " he said .
" a conflict of this magnitude between the foreign and interior ministries can ’ t possibly have escaped the chancellor ’ s notice . ” fischer takes responsibility fischer has reluctantly assumed responsibility for the affair .
but he has refused to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer “ i admit that between 2000 and 2002 and did not react fast enough to reports about the abuse of our new visa-issuing policy , " he said .
" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .
we want to speed up our work , as it seems in the interest of all to shed more light into the affair .
and certainly we are interested in hearing the foreign minister himself as soon as possible . ” praise for prosecutor meanwhile opposition leaders have been praising the man who brought the scandal to light .
they are even suggesting a national award of merit for prosecutor egbert buelles .
he brought a ukrainian man to trial who was accused trafficking in human cargo a year ago - buelles blamed the foreign ministry as being responsible for helping human traffickers by facilitating the influx of illegal workers and prostitutes . the cdu opposition now says the prosecutor acted under enormous pressure when he continued to press claims that government officials were hindering the investigation by dragging their feet over presenting documents and witnesses . tona dunham -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

but a scandal involving the abuse of tourist visas has dented his reputation and is threatening to unravel his political future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .
and until new legislation comes into effect , the 12,000 comatose patients in germany who could theoretically recover one day will be kept alive at all costs . judith hartl -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

hans-otto schiemann , 54 , who claims to be infected with hiv and had unprotected sex with hundreds of thais , was arrested wednesday in chaiyaphum province , three days after re-entering the country through thailand 's main international airport despite being blacklisted .
he is under detention at immigration in bangkok awaiting deportation , " chaiyaphum police lieutenant colonel kampol nonuch told afp .
" he can not be in thailand , as he was listed as persona non grata . "
kampol said schiemann , a army veteran , was deported from thailand march 14 for overstaying his 30-day visa .
he was blacklisted friday march 18 , but his name was not put into the immigration office 's computer until march 21 , one day after schiemann re-entered the kingdom .
police hoped schiemann would now be permanently barred from entering the country , but a deportation date had yet to be set .
the officials said the scale of the problem was not clear , with many women reluctant to come forward for an aids test , but said schiemann could have had sex with up to 400 women and teenage girls .
thailand has no law allowing action against people who knowingly infect someone with hiv .
schiemann refused to take a blood test since being picked up by the authorities in early october .

hans-otto schiemann , 54 , who claims to be infected with hiv and had unprotected sex with hundreds of thais , was arrested wednesday in chaiyaphum province , three days after re-entering the country through thailand 's main international airport despite being blacklisted .
he is under detention at immigration in bangkok awaiting deportation , " chaiyaphum police lieutenant colonel kampol nonuch told afp .
" he can not be in thailand , as he was listed as persona non grata . "
kampol said schiemann , a army veteran , was deported from thailand march 14 for overstaying his 30-day visa .
he was blacklisted friday march 18 , but his name was not put into the immigration office 's computer until march 21 , one day after schiemann re-entered the kingdom .
police hoped schiemann would now be permanently barred from entering the country , but a deportation date had yet to be set .
the officials said the scale of the problem was not clear , with many women reluctant to come forward for an aids test , but said schiemann could have had sex with up to 400 women and teenage girls .
thailand has no law allowing action against people who knowingly infect someone with hiv .
schiemann refused to take a blood test since being picked up by the authorities in early october .
while in custody , he told afp in chaiyaphum that he had contracted hiv three years ago and was " like heroin to girls . " dw-world.de german detained in thai hiv scare a german at the center of an hiv scare involving potentially hundreds of thai women and girls was detained by a court monday for overstaying his visa .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?
now , officials believe that schröder was informed about massive irregularities as early as 2000 , with copies of letters in which the interior minister challenged the visa regulations and the foreign minister defended them .
a foreign ministry spokesman denied that schröder had the letters . but ulrich von klaeden , who represents the opposition conservative christian democrats in the parliamentary inquiry commission isn ’ t willing to let the chancellor off the hook : " i take it that gerhard schroeder himself knew about the discrepancies , " he said .
" a conflict of this magnitude between the foreign and interior ministries can ’ t possibly have escaped the chancellor ’ s notice . ” fischer takes responsibility fischer has reluctantly assumed responsibility for the affair .
but he has refused to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer “ i admit that between 2000 and 2002 and did not react fast enough to reports about the abuse of our new visa-issuing policy , " he said .
" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .
we want to speed up our work , as it seems in the interest of all to shed more light into the affair .
and certainly we are interested in hearing the foreign minister himself as soon as possible . ” praise for prosecutor meanwhile opposition leaders have been praising the man who brought the scandal to light .
they are even suggesting a national award of merit for prosecutor egbert buelles .
he brought a ukrainian man to trial who was accused trafficking in human cargo a year ago - buelles blamed the foreign ministry as being responsible for helping human traffickers by facilitating the influx of illegal workers and prostitutes . the cdu opposition now says the prosecutor acted under enormous pressure when he continued to press claims that government officials were hindering the investigation by dragging their feet over presenting documents and witnesses . tona dunham -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

hans-otto schiemann , 54 , who claims to be infected with hiv and had unprotected sex with hundreds of thais , was arrested wednesday in chaiyaphum province , three days after re-entering the country through thailand 's main international airport despite being blacklisted .
he is under detention at immigration in bangkok awaiting deportation , " chaiyaphum police lieutenant colonel kampol nonuch told afp .
" he can not be in thailand , as he was listed as persona non grata . "
kampol said schiemann , a army veteran , was deported from thailand march 14 for overstaying his 30-day visa .
he was blacklisted friday march 18 , but his name was not put into the immigration office 's computer until march 21 , one day after schiemann re-entered the kingdom .
police hoped schiemann would now be permanently barred from entering the country , but a deportation date had yet to be set .
the officials said the scale of the problem was not clear , with many women reluctant to come forward for an aids test , but said schiemann could have had sex with up to 400 women and teenage girls .
thailand has no law allowing action against people who knowingly infect someone with hiv .
schiemann refused to take a blood test since being picked up by the authorities in early october .
while in custody , he told afp in chaiyaphum that he had contracted hiv three years ago and was " like heroin to girls . " dw-world.de german detained in thai hiv scare a german at the center of an hiv scare involving potentially hundreds of thai women and girls was detained by a court monday for overstaying his visa .

this village of 3,500 people boasts of being the birthplace of " nanus hortorum vulgaris " , or the common garden gnome , which local folklore says was dreamed up by a local potter in 1880 . the craftsmen of the village , including reinhard 's great-grandfather , wasted no time in capitalizing on the idea and , in the land where the brothers grimm created snow white and the seven dwarfs , the popularity of gnomes spread fast . " with his red hat , his lantern , his wheelbarrow and his basket on his back , he is the very image of the miners who used to work in this region , " reinhard said .
" he 's small enough to worm through the mineshafts and always full of the joys of life . " illegal under communism for reinhard , the reign of the gnomes reached a low point in the days when the communist regime in east germany banned them because they were considered a capitalist symbol , although they were happy to export them to the west in return for hard cash . since the mines shut down in this region , gnome manufacture has become the lifeblood of the village .
and there is no shortage of work - reinhard estimates there are more than 18 million garden gnomes in germany alone , 30 of which grace his garden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard has no time for the plastic imitations - for him , it should be a proper , handmade gnome , or nothing .
with the help of his wife iris and his assistant , he fashions the jolly little figures by hand and gives them names , be it fritz , heinz , or willy .
reinhard can identify each batch by their face , height or what they are doing - fishing , dozing or even playing cards . some are a lot naughtier than that - one of reinhard 's top sellers is a mischievous ' voyeur gnome ' with binoculars raised to his eyes and his trousers round his ankles , available to the more adventurous gardener for 34 euros -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slumbers in fairy time warp fighting for the rights of ceramic garden gnomes might sound downright bizarre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .

" with his red hat , his lantern , his wheelbarrow and his basket on his back , he is the very image of the miners who used to work in this region , " reinhard said .
" he 's small enough to worm through the mineshafts and always full of the joys of life . " illegal under communism for reinhard , the reign of the gnomes reached a low point in the days when the communist regime in east germany banned them because they were considered a capitalist symbol , although they were happy to export them to the west in return for hard cash . since the mines shut down in this region , gnome manufacture has become the lifeblood of the village .
and there is no shortage of work - reinhard estimates there are more than 18 million garden gnomes in germany alone , 30 of which grace his garden . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhard has no time for the plastic imitations - for him , it should be a proper , handmade gnome , or nothing .
with the help of his wife iris and his assistant , he fashions the jolly little figures by hand and gives them names , be it fritz , heinz , or willy .
reinhard can identify each batch by their face , height or what they are doing - fishing , dozing or even playing cards . some are a lot naughtier than that - one of reinhard 's top sellers is a mischievous ' voyeur gnome ' with binoculars raised to his eyes and his trousers round his ankles , available to the more adventurous gardener for 34 euros -lrb- $ 45 -rrb- . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany slumbers in fairy time warp fighting for the rights of ceramic garden gnomes might sound downright bizarre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .
and until new legislation comes into effect , the 12,000 comatose patients in germany who could theoretically recover one day will be kept alive at all costs . judith hartl -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

hans-otto schiemann , 54 , who claims to be infected with hiv and had unprotected sex with hundreds of thais , was arrested wednesday in chaiyaphum province , three days after re-entering the country through thailand 's main international airport despite being blacklisted .
he is under detention at immigration in bangkok awaiting deportation , " chaiyaphum police lieutenant colonel kampol nonuch told afp .
" he can not be in thailand , as he was listed as persona non grata . "
kampol said schiemann , a army veteran , was deported from thailand march 14 for overstaying his 30-day visa .
he was blacklisted friday march 18 , but his name was not put into the immigration office 's computer until march 21 , one day after schiemann re-entered the kingdom .
police hoped schiemann would now be permanently barred from entering the country , but a deportation date had yet to be set .
the officials said the scale of the problem was not clear , with many women reluctant to come forward for an aids test , but said schiemann could have had sex with up to 400 women and teenage girls .
thailand has no law allowing action against people who knowingly infect someone with hiv .
schiemann refused to take a blood test since being picked up by the authorities in early october .
while in custody , he told afp in chaiyaphum that he had contracted hiv three years ago and was " like heroin to girls . " dw-world.de german detained in thai hiv scare a german at the center of an hiv scare involving potentially hundreds of thai women and girls was detained by a court monday for overstaying his visa .

" still echoes around erfurt and now in red lake on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago . the latest school shooting in the united states brought back some very painful memories for the people of erfurt , germany . monday 's killings at the red lake high school in minnesota in which 16-year-old jeff weise shot and killed 10 people , including himself , reopened emotional wounds which have yet to heal in the small german town , the scene of one of europe 's bloodiest school massacre three years ago . erfurt ’ s mayor manfred ruge was amongst the first to express his condolences to the victims and their relatives when the news about the shootings in minnesota became known . erfurt 's mayor offers advice from the heart ruge had first hand experience of such a tragedy when , in april 2002 , robert steinhäuser , who had been expelled from the erfurt 's gutenberg high school , killed twelve teachers , a secretary , two students , a police officer and himself .
from the mayor 's own experience three years ago , ruge made it clear that attention is what the people in red lake now need most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering the erfurt tragedy " i would recommend to the administration of red lake : listen to the families .
listen to what they need , " erfurt 's mayor told reporters .
" don ’ t just stay in contact with them : seek out contact with them . because only when people listen to each other , and give courage to each other to express their feelings , then can they help each other . " in their shock three years ago , many germans said publicly that while this sort of thing happens in america , it shouldn ’ t happen here , citing europe 's tighter gun control laws . now following red lake , european editorial writers have turned on the bush administration for not curbing gun ownership .
but mayor ruge doesn ’ t agree . strict gun laws ca n't stop the determined " there ’ s an official statistic in germany which suggests that at least two-thirds of weapons owned by citizens here are illegal . this is a social problem . a large number of germans can get a weapon when they want one , " ruge said . he is convinced that such killings could happen in germany again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floral tributes in erfurt " many of my colleagues made clear that in their school , there have been violence and threats . it just never got to the point where a student killed so many other students and teachers .
in germany , violence in schools is a daily problem . " indeed , in july 2003 , the unthinkable almost happened again .
a 16-year-old boy at a school in the bavarian town of coburg died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of the erfurt school shooting a year before . according to witnesses at the time , the coburg pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , who stood just a few meters in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial outside the coburg school unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as a school counselor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself . school killings not just us phenomenon north america and europe are not the only continents affected by school murders .
in the last year alone , there have been six incidents reported in china .
nine people in total were killed in the attacks which were carried out with knives .
the total would have been a lot higher had the assailants had the same access to guns as those in the us and germany . erik campano -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?
now , officials believe that schröder was informed about massive irregularities as early as 2000 , with copies of letters in which the interior minister challenged the visa regulations and the foreign minister defended them .
a foreign ministry spokesman denied that schröder had the letters . but ulrich von klaeden , who represents the opposition conservative christian democrats in the parliamentary inquiry commission isn ’ t willing to let the chancellor off the hook : " i take it that gerhard schroeder himself knew about the discrepancies , " he said .
" a conflict of this magnitude between the foreign and interior ministries can ’ t possibly have escaped the chancellor ’ s notice . ” fischer takes responsibility fischer has reluctantly assumed responsibility for the affair .
but he has refused to step down . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer “ i admit that between 2000 and 2002 and did not react fast enough to reports about the abuse of our new visa-issuing policy , " he said .
" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .
we want to speed up our work , as it seems in the interest of all to shed more light into the affair .
and certainly we are interested in hearing the foreign minister himself as soon as possible . ” praise for prosecutor meanwhile opposition leaders have been praising the man who brought the scandal to light .
they are even suggesting a national award of merit for prosecutor egbert buelles .
he brought a ukrainian man to trial who was accused trafficking in human cargo a year ago - buelles blamed the foreign ministry as being responsible for helping human traffickers by facilitating the influx of illegal workers and prostitutes . the cdu opposition now says the prosecutor acted under enormous pressure when he continued to press claims that government officials were hindering the investigation by dragging their feet over presenting documents and witnesses . tona dunham -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

the news weekly said the man , identified as an iraqi national named hassan al-sajdi , had claimed in a hostage-style video tape sent to the offices of the us magazine time that he was working for an unnamed german media company .
the man , who had lived for some time in germany , was pictured holding a document believed to be an expired german rail card , spiegel said .
it said the hostage takers , who go by the name of " the protectors of islam brigade , " had also demanded that the german government sever ties with the iraqi authorities .
sources close to the government in berlin said that the man was almost certainly not a german citizen and that its embassy in baghdad had been alerted and was looking into the incident .
spiegel said sajdi had returned to his homeland a few months ago but that he had come to the attention of the german authorities for his links to a group of iraqis in exile who stormed iraq 's embassy in berlin in august 2002 .
iraq has been plagued by repeated hostage-takings of foreigners and locals since the us-led war launched two years ago to remove the former dictator saddam hussein .
some hostages have been released , many of them for ransom , while others have been executed .
the fates of several remain unknown . dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever . "

the news weekly said the man , identified as an iraqi national named hassan al-sajdi , had claimed in a hostage-style video tape sent to the offices of the us magazine time that he was working for an unnamed german media company .
the man , who had lived for some time in germany , was pictured holding a document believed to be an expired german rail card , spiegel said .
it said the hostage takers , who go by the name of " the protectors of islam brigade , " had also demanded that the german government sever ties with the iraqi authorities .
sources close to the government in berlin said that the man was almost certainly not a german citizen and that its embassy in baghdad had been alerted and was looking into the incident .
spiegel said sajdi had returned to his homeland a few months ago but that he had come to the attention of the german authorities for his links to a group of iraqis in exile who stormed iraq 's embassy in berlin in august 2002 .
iraq has been plagued by repeated hostage-takings of foreigners and locals since the us-led war launched two years ago to remove the former dictator saddam hussein .
some hostages have been released , many of them for ransom , while others have been executed .
the fates of several remain unknown . dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever . "

" there will be no trial anymore as mr -lrb- heinrich -rrb- gross is not mentally able to stand trial , " justice ministry spokesman michael standl told afp .
" it is a definite and final decision . " gross , 89 , worked at the am spiegelgrund hospital in vienna , where 789 sick and disabled children died after the nazis , who supported euthanizing the handicapped , annexed austria in 1938 . nine counts of murder he was briefly jailed after the war .
in the early 1980s , a criminal court ignored a finding in a civil case that he was guilty of manslaughter . gross was again brought to trial in the late 1990s - and charged with nine counts of murder - after a former patient on whom he had allegedly experimented recognized him and realized he was working as a forensic psychiatrist for the austrian justice ministry . the case was partly built on a document found in the archives of the former east german secret police , the stasi , which showed that gross had been directly involved in the clinic . but on march 21 , 2000 he was declared unfit to stand trial because of his poor health . standl said there had been new petitions to the justice ministry since , and that gross had been examined by doctors last year who all concluded that he was mentally unstable .
parliament was informed of the decision by justice minister karen miklautsch this week . " the condition is purely mental , " standl said .
" he was examined three times by a doctor in the summer , and others ... agreed with him . " he said gross managed to work as a forensic psychiatrist until 1997 at vienna 's regional criminal court and others in the capital " because the people did not know who he was . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in the hell of a concentration camp the decision is a " scandal " green party mp karl oellinger said the decision was a " scandal " and that gross had fooled doctors and the courts . " for decades as a forensic psychiatrist he decided who was fit to stand trial and who was not , " he said . " and then he is brought to trial and suddenly he is unfit to stand trial . " " the justice ministry has always held a protective hand over heinz gross .
it is very happy to close this case .
it is a scandal and a shame . " standl said gross was the last nazi against whom charges were still being investigated in austria . " there are no other cases , " he said . johann gross -lrb- no relation -rrb- , a former victim of the psychiatrist , said he was not surprised by the justice ministry 's decision . " he still has a lobby behind him , " he told afp .
" it is in the justice ministry 's interest that nothing happens to him because he wrote 60,000 certificates for them in his 30-year career " as a court psychiatrist . gross said he had been a state witness at the trial in the late 1990s , whom he met when he spent several months in am spiegelgrund when he was a young boy . " i still bear the scars , " he said .
" i was given injections , it took the form of punishment because i tried to run away repeatedly .
i doubt that he is insane .
we saw him in the media expressing himself clearly , with all his faculties .

experts say german history lessons are skewed , giving too much weight to the holocaust and failing to teach kids about the rich heritage of german jewry , in which jews were much more than merely the nazis ' victims . germany is socially , culturally and economically poorer since the nazi 's reign of terror killed or chased away most of the country 's jews .
experts agree that school kids do n't know that because they receive a one-sided view of jews as having been little more than the persecuted victims of german history .
they never get wind of the fact that jews contributed vastly to german society .
and it 's something that some people are trying to change . " in german school books and classes there is a sole emphasis on the years of the holocaust , between 1933 and 1945 , " said frankfurt jewish museum director georg heuberger .
" the fate of the jews in nazi germany should be studied in a much broader context .
it should be integrated in 2,000 years of history of the jews in germany . " heuberger was part of an illustrious panel commissioned by the leo baeck institute -lrb- lbi -rrb- , an international organization devoted to the study of german jewry , to draft guidelines to ensure that pupils learn that jews have played a fundamental - and positive - role in european and german culture .
with support from germany 's largest teachers ' union , the gew , and the association of history teachers in germany , the lbi has launched a campaign to convince educational authorities , schoolbook publishers and teacher trainers to change their methods . germany without einstein ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moses mendelssohn -lrb- 1729-1786 -rrb- german culture would be unthinkable without the contributions of jews of the german-speaking world , including enlightenment-age philosopher moses mendelssohn , poet heinrich heine , physicists albert einstein and lise meitner , composer arnold schönberg , filmmaker fritz lang , philosopher hannah arendt and marlene dietrich 's longtime songwriter , friedrich hollaender . silvia haslauer has been teaching history and german at jules verne comprehensive school in berlin 's hellersdorf district since 2002 .
her wards are between 17 and 19 years old , when students prepare for and take germany 's grueling final exams to earn their ticket to university , the abitur .
haslauer said that teachers and their trainers are indeed sensitive to the problem of ensuring pupils receive a differentiated view of german-jewish history . " already in teacher training we examined the problem of jews only being presented in the role of victims , " haslauer explained .
her instructor stressed the merits of field trips to teach kids about german-jewish history .
" we dealt with it through excursions . " haslauer takes her pupils on school trips to concentration camps , synagogues and jewish cemeteries .
she says that especially going to auschwitz is productive , because there " kids see that there was much more than just persecution . "
in school , they also learn about jews in other eras of german history , during medieval times and as german soldiers in world war i , she said . gradual change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz but haslauer pointed out that it 's up to teachers to choose what topics to emphasize , at least in the capital 's schools .
while she feels she has the freedom to make sure german-jewish history is taught , she said changes will have to be made when the centralized abitur , already in effect in nine other states , is introduced in berlin in 2007 .
then , instead of individual teachers deciding what topics their students will be tested on , a central authority will determine the subjects for all final exam-takers . haslauer may be in a better position to address the issue of teaching german-jewish history than her colleagues , since she 's already sensitive to the issue herself and has more space to influence what her students learn than in other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , heuberger and the lbi commission certainly believe there are glaring discrepancies that still need to be addressed .
" young people have to understand that the jews were not strangers in germany , foreigners like some of the minorities that live in germany today . "
and he stressed that german jewry should n't only be considered in the past tense , disregarding the fact that hundreds of thousands of jews live here again . but heuberger is positive that improvements will be made over time .
" the change is gradual , but we were already sent a new school book last week .
we are optimistic that the changes will slowly come and that eventually the schools will pay more attention to the jewish contribution to their society . " nancy isenson , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jews in germany feel winds of change as the world jewish congress wraps up its annual meeting in brussels this week , lively debate continues among germany 's jewish leaders on anti-semitism , immigration and the future of german jewry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 -pipe- 13:00 utc asylum seeker taken hostage in iraq a man seeking asylum in germany and claiming to be a journalist has been taken hostage by a previously unknown group demanding the release of all muslims in german jails , german news magazine der spiegel reported on thursday .
the news weekly said the man , identified as an iraqi national named hassan al-sajdi , had claimed in a hostage-style video tape sent to the offices of the us magazine time that he was working for an unnamed german media company .
the man , who had lived for some time in germany , was pictured holding a document believed to be an expired german rail card , spiegel said .
it said the hostage takers , who go by the name of " the protectors of islam brigade , " had also demanded that the german government sever ties with the iraqi authorities .
sources close to the government in berlin said that the man was almost certainly not a german citizen and that its embassy in baghdad had been alerted and was looking into the incident .
spiegel said sajdi had returned to his homeland a few months ago but that he had come to the attention of the german authorities for his links to a group of iraqis in exile who stormed iraq 's embassy in berlin in august 2002 .
iraq has been plagued by repeated hostage-takings of foreigners and locals since the us-led war launched two years ago to remove the former dictator saddam hussein .
some hostages have been released , many of them for ransom , while others have been executed .
the fates of several remain unknown . dw-world.de french reporters freed in iraq two french journalists held hostage in iraq for the past four months were freed tuesday , officials said , sparking jubilation among relatives who called it " the most beautiful christmas present ever . "

experts say german history lessons are skewed , giving too much weight to the holocaust and failing to teach kids about the rich heritage of german jewry , in which jews were much more than merely the nazis ' victims . germany is socially , culturally and economically poorer since the nazi 's reign of terror killed or chased away most of the country 's jews .
experts agree that school kids do n't know that because they receive a one-sided view of jews as having been little more than the persecuted victims of german history .
they never get wind of the fact that jews contributed vastly to german society .
and it 's something that some people are trying to change . " in german school books and classes there is a sole emphasis on the years of the holocaust , between 1933 and 1945 , " said frankfurt jewish museum director georg heuberger .
" the fate of the jews in nazi germany should be studied in a much broader context .
it should be integrated in 2,000 years of history of the jews in germany . " heuberger was part of an illustrious panel commissioned by the leo baeck institute -lrb- lbi -rrb- , an international organization devoted to the study of german jewry , to draft guidelines to ensure that pupils learn that jews have played a fundamental - and positive - role in european and german culture .
with support from germany 's largest teachers ' union , the gew , and the association of history teachers in germany , the lbi has launched a campaign to convince educational authorities , schoolbook publishers and teacher trainers to change their methods . germany without einstein ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moses mendelssohn -lrb- 1729-1786 -rrb- german culture would be unthinkable without the contributions of jews of the german-speaking world , including enlightenment-age philosopher moses mendelssohn , poet heinrich heine , physicists albert einstein and lise meitner , composer arnold schönberg , filmmaker fritz lang , philosopher hannah arendt and marlene dietrich 's longtime songwriter , friedrich hollaender . silvia haslauer has been teaching history and german at jules verne comprehensive school in berlin 's hellersdorf district since 2002 .
her wards are between 17 and 19 years old , when students prepare for and take germany 's grueling final exams to earn their ticket to university , the abitur .
haslauer said that teachers and their trainers are indeed sensitive to the problem of ensuring pupils receive a differentiated view of german-jewish history . " already in teacher training we examined the problem of jews only being presented in the role of victims , " haslauer explained .
her instructor stressed the merits of field trips to teach kids about german-jewish history .
" we dealt with it through excursions . " haslauer takes her pupils on school trips to concentration camps , synagogues and jewish cemeteries .
she says that especially going to auschwitz is productive , because there " kids see that there was much more than just persecution . "
in school , they also learn about jews in other eras of german history , during medieval times and as german soldiers in world war i , she said . gradual change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auschwitz but haslauer pointed out that it 's up to teachers to choose what topics to emphasize , at least in the capital 's schools .
while she feels she has the freedom to make sure german-jewish history is taught , she said changes will have to be made when the centralized abitur , already in effect in nine other states , is introduced in berlin in 2007 .
then , instead of individual teachers deciding what topics their students will be tested on , a central authority will determine the subjects for all final exam-takers . haslauer may be in a better position to address the issue of teaching german-jewish history than her colleagues , since she 's already sensitive to the issue herself and has more space to influence what her students learn than in other states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the same time , heuberger and the lbi commission certainly believe there are glaring discrepancies that still need to be addressed .
" young people have to understand that the jews were not strangers in germany , foreigners like some of the minorities that live in germany today . "
and he stressed that german jewry should n't only be considered in the past tense , disregarding the fact that hundreds of thousands of jews live here again . but heuberger is positive that improvements will be made over time .
" the change is gradual , but we were already sent a new school book last week .
we are optimistic that the changes will slowly come and that eventually the schools will pay more attention to the jewish contribution to their society .

not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this situation is very sad .
terri 's husband has the right to remove her feeding tube .
written and legal documents are available to eliminate this situation .
bush and his politicians are wrong in what they have done .
they are using this sad case to get the right for life people , religous groups and the roman catholic groups on their republican party side ! !
the government does not have the right to intervene in these matters .
my wife and i are retired and live in florida now , in the us . i am sad and angry over the government messing with this situation for political gains .
it 's so phony . - dan droege , usa nutrition and hydration are basics for a human being .
none should have the right to discontinue it .
there is a possibility that she could swallow liquid food and water . she is not in a coma and is able to interact with others .
in addition , in the case of terri schiavo there are enough suspect circumstances to show that her husband has a conflict of interest in this case .
terri 's bone scan shows long term trauma that indicates possibility of domestic violence .
there is a nurse 's affadavit that michael schiavo admitted not to knowing terri 's wishes .
he is living in a common-law relationship with another woman and has had children with her .
three months after receiving $ 700,000 usd in a malpractice suit against terri 's doctors that was supposed to pay for her rehabilitation needs , he ordered doctors to stop any therapy . - andrew jezierski he is n't " helping " her to die , he 's fulfilling her wish as verbally expressed to him within the covenant of their marriage -lrb- from what i understand , florida law allows him to make end-of-life decisions regarding his spouse -rrb- as a normally republican voting american , i find the intervention of the congress a cynical attempt to placate the religious right . - eric rhyne , usa i think the term " allowing her to die " masks what is happening - terri is being starved and dehydrated to death .
there has been little attempt at rehabilitation although her husband promised to use the money terri was awarded to do this .
her parents are willing to look after her and her husband can get on with his life with his new partner and his two children by her .
there have been numerous cases of people who have awoken from so called pvs .
in france the editor of elle , jean- dominique bauby , wrote a book about his life after a massive stroke left him completely paralysed except for being able to blink an eyelid .
pvs is a term used to dehumanise a person so that s / he can be killed . - janet secluna thomas , u.k. i know that if anything like this should happen in my family we would probably take a lot of time before we allowed the injured person to die .
i personally would say yes and let the person die .
better than to see her or him living on tubes . - florina gheorghiu , romania i live in san francisco , california , and i absolutely feel that ms. schiavo 's parents should decide her fate , not her husband !
for one thing , he has resisted allowing her to get the proper rehabilitation she has needed since 1991 .
truth is , nobody knows what could happen to her because she has n't recieved the proper rehabilitation yet .
she is still alive and a young woman too ! !
she has a chance and it is absolutely barbaric to starve her to death !
the process of starvation is horrific and gruesome .
i am absolutely disgusted with what 's going on right now .
her husband has moved on to a new woman and a new family , and he will gain a substantial amount of money from her death .
this is sick and i for one , am on the verge of vomitting at the thought of it .
please , people , do n't base your opinion on whether or not you believe she should live in this state of being ; base your decision on terri 's case alone : after knowing the facts of her case , who should be able to decide her fate , her husband or her parents ? - julie h. usa no , i do not think her husband has a right since he is living with another women and has two children . i only believe the parents have the legal right but this should have been done when he left his vow of marriage . - catherine moreland i am quite saddened to the see the amount of attention this case is getting in the global media .
we do n't care about thousands of people including children dying of hunger everyday , and at the same time , we have no qualms talking a lot about a single human being who has been in coma for the last several years !
regardless of how iteresting philosophically this case is , do n't you think it is unfair to discuss this at such a great length , when there are clearly more pressing issues that the media should talk about ? - ram natarajan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .

" we assure the pope , once again , of our prayers and affection .

" " that is also a gift of god considering the physical challenges that john paul ii faces , " cardinal joseph ratzinger told rai television in an interview . ratzinger , the influential german head of the vatican congregation for the doctrine of the faith , said the pope 's mind " is alive and there is possibly an even stronger discernment . "
john paul ii has retained " the capacity to choose the essential and to govern , while suffering , with few but crucial decisions , " said raztinger , who will fill in for the absent pope at the way of the cross ceremony on friday . the pope has always been capable of taking the fundamental decisions , the cardinal added , although he " has certainly revised his activities . "
the frail 84-year-old pontiff has not spoken in public since march 13 , when he was discharged from hospital after a throat operation . delegation the pope , who suffers from parkinson 's disease , has had to delegate all ceremonies this easter to his cardinals , except the urbi et orbi -lrb- to rome and to the world -rrb- blessing on sunday when he traditionally blessed the faithful in some 60 languages . cardinal angelo scola said not participating in friday 's way of the cross " was certainly a great sacrifice " for the pope .
scola , who is considered a possible successor to pope john paul ii , said that although the pontiff could not be among the faithful physically , " in a certain sense he will be with them in an even more powerful way . " " this is the great mystery of the church , " said scola , who is patriarch of venice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii waves as he leaves rome 's polyclinic agostino gemelli hospital aboard his popemobile , thursday , feb .

" the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .

"
john paul ii has retained " the capacity to choose the essential and to govern , while suffering , with few but crucial decisions , " said raztinger , who will fill in for the absent pope at the way of the cross ceremony on friday . the pope has always been capable of taking the fundamental decisions , the cardinal added , although he " has certainly revised his activities . "

scola , who is considered a possible successor to pope john paul ii , said that although the pontiff could not be among the faithful physically , " in a certain sense he will be with them in an even more powerful way .

dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this situation is very sad .
terri 's husband has the right to remove her feeding tube .
written and legal documents are available to eliminate this situation .
bush and his politicians are wrong in what they have done .
they are using this sad case to get the right for life people , religous groups and the roman catholic groups on their republican party side ! !
the government does not have the right to intervene in these matters .
my wife and i are retired and live in florida now , in the us . i am sad and angry over the government messing with this situation for political gains .
it 's so phony . - dan droege , usa nutrition and hydration are basics for a human being .
none should have the right to discontinue it .
there is a possibility that she could swallow liquid food and water . she is not in a coma and is able to interact with others .
in addition , in the case of terri schiavo there are enough suspect circumstances to show that her husband has a conflict of interest in this case .
terri 's bone scan shows long term trauma that indicates possibility of domestic violence .
there is a nurse 's affadavit that michael schiavo admitted not to knowing terri 's wishes .
he is living in a common-law relationship with another woman and has had children with her .
three months after receiving $ 700,000 usd in a malpractice suit against terri 's doctors that was supposed to pay for her rehabilitation needs , he ordered doctors to stop any therapy . - andrew jezierski he is n't " helping " her to die , he 's fulfilling her wish as verbally expressed to him within the covenant of their marriage -lrb- from what i understand , florida law allows him to make end-of-life decisions regarding his spouse -rrb- as a normally republican voting american , i find the intervention of the congress a cynical attempt to placate the religious right . - eric rhyne , usa i think the term " allowing her to die " masks what is happening - terri is being starved and dehydrated to death .
there has been little attempt at rehabilitation although her husband promised to use the money terri was awarded to do this .
her parents are willing to look after her and her husband can get on with his life with his new partner and his two children by her .
there have been numerous cases of people who have awoken from so called pvs .
in france the editor of elle , jean- dominique bauby , wrote a book about his life after a massive stroke left him completely paralysed except for being able to blink an eyelid .
pvs is a term used to dehumanise a person so that s / he can be killed . - janet secluna thomas , u.k. i know that if anything like this should happen in my family we would probably take a lot of time before we allowed the injured person to die .
i personally would say yes and let the person die .
better than to see her or him living on tubes . - florina gheorghiu , romania i live in san francisco , california , and i absolutely feel that ms. schiavo 's parents should decide her fate , not her husband !
for one thing , he has resisted allowing her to get the proper rehabilitation she has needed since 1991 .
truth is , nobody knows what could happen to her because she has n't recieved the proper rehabilitation yet .
she is still alive and a young woman too ! !
she has a chance and it is absolutely barbaric to starve her to death !
the process of starvation is horrific and gruesome .
i am absolutely disgusted with what 's going on right now .
her husband has moved on to a new woman and a new family , and he will gain a substantial amount of money from her death .
this is sick and i for one , am on the verge of vomitting at the thought of it .
please , people , do n't base your opinion on whether or not you believe she should live in this state of being ; base your decision on terri 's case alone : after knowing the facts of her case , who should be able to decide her fate , her husband or her parents ? - julie h. usa no , i do not think her husband has a right since he is living with another women and has two children . i only believe the parents have the legal right but this should have been done when he left his vow of marriage . - catherine moreland i am quite saddened to the see the amount of attention this case is getting in the global media .
we do n't care about thousands of people including children dying of hunger everyday , and at the same time , we have no qualms talking a lot about a single human being who has been in coma for the last several years !
regardless of how iteresting philosophically this case is , do n't you think it is unfair to discuss this at such a great length , when there are clearly more pressing issues that the media should talk about ? - ram natarajan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

" still echoes around erfurt and now in red lake on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago . the latest school shooting in the united states brought back some very painful memories for the people of erfurt , germany . monday 's killings at the red lake high school in minnesota in which 16-year-old jeff weise shot and killed 10 people , including himself , reopened emotional wounds which have yet to heal in the small german town , the scene of one of europe 's bloodiest school massacre three years ago . erfurt ’ s mayor manfred ruge was amongst the first to express his condolences to the victims and their relatives when the news about the shootings in minnesota became known . erfurt 's mayor offers advice from the heart ruge had first hand experience of such a tragedy when , in april 2002 , robert steinhäuser , who had been expelled from the erfurt 's gutenberg high school , killed twelve teachers , a secretary , two students , a police officer and himself .
from the mayor 's own experience three years ago , ruge made it clear that attention is what the people in red lake now need most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering the erfurt tragedy " i would recommend to the administration of red lake : listen to the families .
listen to what they need , " erfurt 's mayor told reporters .
" don ’ t just stay in contact with them : seek out contact with them . because only when people listen to each other , and give courage to each other to express their feelings , then can they help each other . " in their shock three years ago , many germans said publicly that while this sort of thing happens in america , it shouldn ’ t happen here , citing europe 's tighter gun control laws . now following red lake , european editorial writers have turned on the bush administration for not curbing gun ownership .
but mayor ruge doesn ’ t agree . strict gun laws ca n't stop the determined " there ’ s an official statistic in germany which suggests that at least two-thirds of weapons owned by citizens here are illegal . this is a social problem . a large number of germans can get a weapon when they want one , " ruge said . he is convinced that such killings could happen in germany again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floral tributes in erfurt " many of my colleagues made clear that in their school , there have been violence and threats . it just never got to the point where a student killed so many other students and teachers .
in germany , violence in schools is a daily problem . " indeed , in july 2003 , the unthinkable almost happened again .
a 16-year-old boy at a school in the bavarian town of coburg died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of the erfurt school shooting a year before . according to witnesses at the time , the coburg pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , who stood just a few meters in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial outside the coburg school unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as a school counselor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself . school killings not just us phenomenon north america and europe are not the only continents affected by school murders .
in the last year alone , there have been six incidents reported in china .
nine people in total were killed in the attacks which were carried out with knives .
the total would have been a lot higher had the assailants had the same access to guns as those in the us and germany . erik campano -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .

if you would like to have your say , click on the feedback button below .
not all reader comments will be published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . this situation is very sad .
terri 's husband has the right to remove her feeding tube .
written and legal documents are available to eliminate this situation .
bush and his politicians are wrong in what they have done .
they are using this sad case to get the right for life people , religous groups and the roman catholic groups on their republican party side ! !
the government does not have the right to intervene in these matters .
my wife and i are retired and live in florida now , in the us . i am sad and angry over the government messing with this situation for political gains .
it 's so phony . - dan droege , usa nutrition and hydration are basics for a human being .
none should have the right to discontinue it .
there is a possibility that she could swallow liquid food and water . she is not in a coma and is able to interact with others .
in addition , in the case of terri schiavo there are enough suspect circumstances to show that her husband has a conflict of interest in this case .
terri 's bone scan shows long term trauma that indicates possibility of domestic violence .
there is a nurse 's affadavit that michael schiavo admitted not to knowing terri 's wishes .
he is living in a common-law relationship with another woman and has had children with her .
three months after receiving $ 700,000 usd in a malpractice suit against terri 's doctors that was supposed to pay for her rehabilitation needs , he ordered doctors to stop any therapy . - andrew jezierski he is n't " helping " her to die , he 's fulfilling her wish as verbally expressed to him within the covenant of their marriage -lrb- from what i understand , florida law allows him to make end-of-life decisions regarding his spouse -rrb- as a normally republican voting american , i find the intervention of the congress a cynical attempt to placate the religious right . - eric rhyne , usa i think the term " allowing her to die " masks what is happening - terri is being starved and dehydrated to death .
there has been little attempt at rehabilitation although her husband promised to use the money terri was awarded to do this .
her parents are willing to look after her and her husband can get on with his life with his new partner and his two children by her .
there have been numerous cases of people who have awoken from so called pvs .
in france the editor of elle , jean- dominique bauby , wrote a book about his life after a massive stroke left him completely paralysed except for being able to blink an eyelid .
pvs is a term used to dehumanise a person so that s / he can be killed . - janet secluna thomas , u.k. i know that if anything like this should happen in my family we would probably take a lot of time before we allowed the injured person to die .
i personally would say yes and let the person die .
better than to see her or him living on tubes . - florina gheorghiu , romania i live in san francisco , california , and i absolutely feel that ms. schiavo 's parents should decide her fate , not her husband !
for one thing , he has resisted allowing her to get the proper rehabilitation she has needed since 1991 .
truth is , nobody knows what could happen to her because she has n't recieved the proper rehabilitation yet .
she is still alive and a young woman too ! !
she has a chance and it is absolutely barbaric to starve her to death !
the process of starvation is horrific and gruesome .
i am absolutely disgusted with what 's going on right now .
her husband has moved on to a new woman and a new family , and he will gain a substantial amount of money from her death .
this is sick and i for one , am on the verge of vomitting at the thought of it .
please , people , do n't base your opinion on whether or not you believe she should live in this state of being ; base your decision on terri 's case alone : after knowing the facts of her case , who should be able to decide her fate , her husband or her parents ? - julie h. usa no , i do not think her husband has a right since he is living with another women and has two children . i only believe the parents have the legal right but this should have been done when he left his vow of marriage . - catherine moreland i am quite saddened to the see the amount of attention this case is getting in the global media .
we do n't care about thousands of people including children dying of hunger everyday , and at the same time , we have no qualms talking a lot about a single human being who has been in coma for the last several years !
regardless of how iteresting philosophically this case is , do n't you think it is unfair to discuss this at such a great length , when there are clearly more pressing issues that the media should talk about ? - ram natarajan send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .

privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.03.2005 accused nazi child killer goes free großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accused of taking part in gruesome deaths austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial . the austrian government on wednesday said it had dropped the case against a former nazi psychiatrist accused of killing children at a vienna clinic during world war ii because he suffers from dementia . " there will be no trial anymore as mr -lrb- heinrich -rrb- gross is not mentally able to stand trial , " justice ministry spokesman michael standl told afp .
" it is a definite and final decision . " gross , 89 , worked at the am spiegelgrund hospital in vienna , where 789 sick and disabled children died after the nazis , who supported euthanizing the handicapped , annexed austria in 1938 . nine counts of murder he was briefly jailed after the war .
in the early 1980s , a criminal court ignored a finding in a civil case that he was guilty of manslaughter . gross was again brought to trial in the late 1990s - and charged with nine counts of murder - after a former patient on whom he had allegedly experimented recognized him and realized he was working as a forensic psychiatrist for the austrian justice ministry . the case was partly built on a document found in the archives of the former east german secret police , the stasi , which showed that gross had been directly involved in the clinic . but on march 21 , 2000 he was declared unfit to stand trial because of his poor health . standl said there had been new petitions to the justice ministry since , and that gross had been examined by doctors last year who all concluded that he was mentally unstable .
parliament was informed of the decision by justice minister karen miklautsch this week . " the condition is purely mental , " standl said .
" he was examined three times by a doctor in the summer , and others ... agreed with him . " he said gross managed to work as a forensic psychiatrist until 1997 at vienna 's regional criminal court and others in the capital " because the people did not know who he was . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in the hell of a concentration camp the decision is a " scandal " green party mp karl oellinger said the decision was a " scandal " and that gross had fooled doctors and the courts . " for decades as a forensic psychiatrist he decided who was fit to stand trial and who was not , " he said . " and then he is brought to trial and suddenly he is unfit to stand trial . " " the justice ministry has always held a protective hand over heinz gross .
it is very happy to close this case .
it is a scandal and a shame . " standl said gross was the last nazi against whom charges were still being investigated in austria . " there are no other cases , " he said . johann gross -lrb- no relation -rrb- , a former victim of the psychiatrist , said he was not surprised by the justice ministry 's decision . " he still has a lobby behind him , " he told afp .
" it is in the justice ministry 's interest that nothing happens to him because he wrote 60,000 certificates for them in his 30-year career " as a court psychiatrist . gross said he had been a state witness at the trial in the late 1990s , whom he met when he spent several months in am spiegelgrund when he was a young boy . " i still bear the scars , " he said .
" i was given injections , it took the form of punishment because i tried to run away repeatedly .
i doubt that he is insane .
we saw him in the media expressing himself clearly , with all his faculties .
the story reminds one of -lrb- former chilean dictator augusto -rrb- pinochet . " horrifying tests the extent to which euthanasia was practised by nazis in austria came to light when hundreds of jars holding body parts of dead children in formaldehyde were found in the cellar of am spiegelgrund . test were carried out on some of the remains , which showed traces of lethal drugs , before they were handed to families for burial . academics recently said they had found a document with hitler 's letterhead and signature in which the dictator ordered the euthanasia of mentally and physically disabled people . hitler 's reportedly schizophrenic niece aloisia died in the gas chambers at hartheim near the austrian city of linz . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mengele hometown opens victim memorial the hometown of nazi war criminal josef mengele opened a memorial to his victims tuesday aimed as an indelible reminder of the horrors of german history .

" there will be no trial anymore as mr -lrb- heinrich -rrb- gross is not mentally able to stand trial , " justice ministry spokesman michael standl told afp .
" it is a definite and final decision . " gross , 89 , worked at the am spiegelgrund hospital in vienna , where 789 sick and disabled children died after the nazis , who supported euthanizing the handicapped , annexed austria in 1938 . nine counts of murder he was briefly jailed after the war .
in the early 1980s , a criminal court ignored a finding in a civil case that he was guilty of manslaughter . gross was again brought to trial in the late 1990s - and charged with nine counts of murder - after a former patient on whom he had allegedly experimented recognized him and realized he was working as a forensic psychiatrist for the austrian justice ministry . the case was partly built on a document found in the archives of the former east german secret police , the stasi , which showed that gross had been directly involved in the clinic . but on march 21 , 2000 he was declared unfit to stand trial because of his poor health . standl said there had been new petitions to the justice ministry since , and that gross had been examined by doctors last year who all concluded that he was mentally unstable .
parliament was informed of the decision by justice minister karen miklautsch this week . " the condition is purely mental , " standl said .

experts say german history lessons are skewed , giving too much weight to the holocaust and failing to teach kids about the rich heritage of german jewry , in which jews were much more than merely the nazis ' victims . germany is socially , culturally and economically poorer since the nazi 's reign of terror killed or chased away most of the country 's jews .
experts agree that school kids do n't know that because they receive a one-sided view of jews as having been little more than the persecuted victims of german history .
they never get wind of the fact that jews contributed vastly to german society .
and it 's something that some people are trying to change . " in german school books and classes there is a sole emphasis on the years of the holocaust , between 1933 and 1945 , " said frankfurt jewish museum director georg heuberger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 kohl 's stasi files released großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi secrets about kohl : coming to a newsstand near you after a long legal battle , parts of a vast archive on former german chancellor helmut kohl compiled by the notorious east german stasi secret police were released thursday for the first time but under heavy restrictions . two files of around 1,000 pages each were made available in berlin to a select group of researchers and journalists , under orders not to publish them , while parts of the documents referring to kohl 's personal life were blacked out . the move follows years of legal efforts by kohl , who led west germany when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and supervised the unification process with the former communist east , to have the archives suppressed .
many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .
" people should ask their tax office for an explanation if they receive notices from the bank .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.03.2005 accused nazi child killer goes free großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : accused of taking part in gruesome deaths austrian justice officials have dismissed murder charges against a former nazi psychiatrist , saying he is mentally unfit to stand trial . the austrian government on wednesday said it had dropped the case against a former nazi psychiatrist accused of killing children at a vienna clinic during world war ii because he suffers from dementia . " there will be no trial anymore as mr -lrb- heinrich -rrb- gross is not mentally able to stand trial , " justice ministry spokesman michael standl told afp .
" it is a definite and final decision . " gross , 89 , worked at the am spiegelgrund hospital in vienna , where 789 sick and disabled children died after the nazis , who supported euthanizing the handicapped , annexed austria in 1938 . nine counts of murder he was briefly jailed after the war .
in the early 1980s , a criminal court ignored a finding in a civil case that he was guilty of manslaughter . gross was again brought to trial in the late 1990s - and charged with nine counts of murder - after a former patient on whom he had allegedly experimented recognized him and realized he was working as a forensic psychiatrist for the austrian justice ministry . the case was partly built on a document found in the archives of the former east german secret police , the stasi , which showed that gross had been directly involved in the clinic . but on march 21 , 2000 he was declared unfit to stand trial because of his poor health . standl said there had been new petitions to the justice ministry since , and that gross had been examined by doctors last year who all concluded that he was mentally unstable .
parliament was informed of the decision by justice minister karen miklautsch this week . " the condition is purely mental , " standl said .
" he was examined three times by a doctor in the summer , and others ... agreed with him . " he said gross managed to work as a forensic psychiatrist until 1997 at vienna 's regional criminal court and others in the capital " because the people did not know who he was . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in the hell of a concentration camp the decision is a " scandal " green party mp karl oellinger said the decision was a " scandal " and that gross had fooled doctors and the courts . " for decades as a forensic psychiatrist he decided who was fit to stand trial and who was not , " he said . " and then he is brought to trial and suddenly he is unfit to stand trial . " " the justice ministry has always held a protective hand over heinz gross .
it is very happy to close this case .
it is a scandal and a shame . " standl said gross was the last nazi against whom charges were still being investigated in austria . " there are no other cases , " he said . johann gross -lrb- no relation -rrb- , a former victim of the psychiatrist , said he was not surprised by the justice ministry 's decision . " he still has a lobby behind him , " he told afp .
" it is in the justice ministry 's interest that nothing happens to him because he wrote 60,000 certificates for them in his 30-year career " as a court psychiatrist . gross said he had been a state witness at the trial in the late 1990s , whom he met when he spent several months in am spiegelgrund when he was a young boy . " i still bear the scars , " he said .
" i was given injections , it took the form of punishment because i tried to run away repeatedly .
i doubt that he is insane .
we saw him in the media expressing himself clearly , with all his faculties .
the story reminds one of -lrb- former chilean dictator augusto -rrb- pinochet . " horrifying tests the extent to which euthanasia was practised by nazis in austria came to light when hundreds of jars holding body parts of dead children in formaldehyde were found in the cellar of am spiegelgrund . test were carried out on some of the remains , which showed traces of lethal drugs , before they were handed to families for burial . academics recently said they had found a document with hitler 's letterhead and signature in which the dictator ordered the euthanasia of mentally and physically disabled people . hitler 's reportedly schizophrenic niece aloisia died in the gas chambers at hartheim near the austrian city of linz . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mengele hometown opens victim memorial the hometown of nazi war criminal josef mengele opened a memorial to his victims tuesday aimed as an indelible reminder of the horrors of german history .

" still echoes around erfurt and now in red lake on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago . the latest school shooting in the united states brought back some very painful memories for the people of erfurt , germany . monday 's killings at the red lake high school in minnesota in which 16-year-old jeff weise shot and killed 10 people , including himself , reopened emotional wounds which have yet to heal in the small german town , the scene of one of europe 's bloodiest school massacre three years ago . erfurt ’ s mayor manfred ruge was amongst the first to express his condolences to the victims and their relatives when the news about the shootings in minnesota became known . erfurt 's mayor offers advice from the heart ruge had first hand experience of such a tragedy when , in april 2002 , robert steinhäuser , who had been expelled from the erfurt 's gutenberg high school , killed twelve teachers , a secretary , two students , a police officer and himself .
from the mayor 's own experience three years ago , ruge made it clear that attention is what the people in red lake now need most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering the erfurt tragedy " i would recommend to the administration of red lake : listen to the families .
listen to what they need , " erfurt 's mayor told reporters .
" don ’ t just stay in contact with them : seek out contact with them . because only when people listen to each other , and give courage to each other to express their feelings , then can they help each other . " in their shock three years ago , many germans said publicly that while this sort of thing happens in america , it shouldn ’ t happen here , citing europe 's tighter gun control laws . now following red lake , european editorial writers have turned on the bush administration for not curbing gun ownership .
but mayor ruge doesn ’ t agree . strict gun laws ca n't stop the determined " there ’ s an official statistic in germany which suggests that at least two-thirds of weapons owned by citizens here are illegal . this is a social problem . a large number of germans can get a weapon when they want one , " ruge said . he is convinced that such killings could happen in germany again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floral tributes in erfurt " many of my colleagues made clear that in their school , there have been violence and threats . it just never got to the point where a student killed so many other students and teachers .
in germany , violence in schools is a daily problem . " indeed , in july 2003 , the unthinkable almost happened again .
a 16-year-old boy at a school in the bavarian town of coburg died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of the erfurt school shooting a year before . according to witnesses at the time , the coburg pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , who stood just a few meters in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial outside the coburg school unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as a school counselor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself . school killings not just us phenomenon north america and europe are not the only continents affected by school murders .
in the last year alone , there have been six incidents reported in china .
nine people in total were killed in the attacks which were carried out with knives .
the total would have been a lot higher had the assailants had the same access to guns as those in the us and germany . erik campano -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 kohl 's stasi files released großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi secrets about kohl : coming to a newsstand near you after a long legal battle , parts of a vast archive on former german chancellor helmut kohl compiled by the notorious east german stasi secret police were released thursday for the first time but under heavy restrictions . two files of around 1,000 pages each were made available in berlin to a select group of researchers and journalists , under orders not to publish them , while parts of the documents referring to kohl 's personal life were blacked out . the move follows years of legal efforts by kohl , who led west germany when the berlin wall fell in 1989 and supervised the unification process with the former communist east , to have the archives suppressed .
many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .

many observers have speculated that the files on wiretaps the stasi carried out between 1982 and 1989 could include information linked to a party funding scandal over which his career faltered in 2000 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler but marianne birthler -lrb- photo -rrb- , the head of the stasi archives office , has that the documents are unlikely to contain any great revelations and that the years of legal wrangling surrounding them was probably all for nothing . " the fact that the documents have now been published makes this clear , " she told german radio station rbb . 9,000 pages on kohl bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stasi museum , once the headquarters of the feared east german secret police , in berlin the stasi , widely reviled for its repressive methods and close monitoring of its citizens and officials within and outside east germany , compiled nearly 9,000 pages on kohl as it tapped his telephones for most of the 1980s .
the german news agency dpa reported that in many parts of the documents , which include newspaper clippings , names and personal purchases have been deleted , it said , without providing any details . the disclosure comes following a court ruling in june that the files could be made available to researchers and journalists if they did not relate to the personal life of the 74-year-old conservative former leader . it means members of the media must get consent when they try to obtain information about kohl , who led the united germany until his defeat by the current chancellor , gerhard schröder , in 1998 .
under the ruling , researchers may have access to the files but must guarantee that the information does not fall into " unauthorised hands " or be released into the public domain . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former german chancellor helmut kohl many people have argued that kohl should not be spared the treatment given to hundreds of prominent east germans , many of whom have been embarrassed by revelations long buried in the archives or unmasked as stasi spies . lengthy legal battle the release of the files follows a lengthy legal process to keep the information under wraps .
over a year ago , the former chancellor thought that his story would remain untold when the federal administrative court ruled to impose major restrictions on the release and publication of the stasi files . though the court upheld portions of an earlier ruling ordering that kohl 's files be made available to journalists , the conditions at the time made it impossible for vast amounts of the data to be obtained . one of the major sticking points in the case for opening the files was the fact that much of the information contained in them was obtained illegally . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stasi files the court ruled in 2004 that the stasi information garnered through wiretaps in private or working rooms was fundamentally banned from public release .
the judgement applied not only to the alleged recordings and transcripts , but also to all reports , analysis papers and position papers that had been drawn from these sources . birthler , a former east german dissident whose archive is a huge database of citizens of east germany and some west germans , has called for much broader background checks on officials from both east and west using the stasi files .
in july 2001 , kohl won a case , upheld a year later , arguing he was entitled to privacy as he was a " victim " rather than a collaborator .
the decision halted a 10-year practice of allowing publication of files on public figures . however birthler took the case back to court arguing that a new law passed by parliament allowed the publication of records on public figures whether or not they were victims . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de former cdu officials in court for slush fund trial ex-interior minister manfred kanther , prince casimir wittgenstein , a former state treasurer , and horst weyrauch , a former financial adviser to helmut kohl 's cdu , all face charges related to illegal funding of the party .

this involves having allowed thousands of illegal workers and prostitutes into germany between 2000 and 2003 - most of them from ukraine . officials are investigating when leading politicians became aware of the problem and why they did not react sooner .
the inquiry has uncovered that several cabinet ministers failed to react to early warnings about the abuse of visa regulations under which applicants were not subjected to proper checks . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how much did schröder know ?

a foreign ministry spokesman denied that schröder had the letters . but ulrich von klaeden , who represents the opposition conservative christian democrats in the parliamentary inquiry commission isn ’ t willing to let the chancellor off the hook : " i take it that gerhard schroeder himself knew about the discrepancies , " he said .

" and i should have done more to prevent further irregularities . ” opponents accuse him of riding out the storm , as he requests more time to prepare for a hearing before the inquiry which could take months .
but the green party 's jerzy montag who is part of the inquiry commission , says the panel is working as fast as possible : “ we ’ ve already fixed additional dates for inquiry sessions .

they are even suggesting a national award of merit for prosecutor egbert buelles .
he brought a ukrainian man to trial who was accused trafficking in human cargo a year ago - buelles blamed the foreign ministry as being responsible for helping human traffickers by facilitating the influx of illegal workers and prostitutes . the cdu opposition now says the prosecutor acted under enormous pressure when he continued to press claims that government officials were hindering the investigation by dragging their feet over presenting documents and witnesses . tona dunham -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new allegations against embattled minister german foreign minister fischer , engulfed in a tourist visa row , saw first-hand the vast number of people flocking to the country 's embassy in ukraine years ago , according to a newspaper report .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 24.03.2005 law allows officials to access bank details großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as of april 1 , bank account details can be provided to tax offices a decision by germany 's highest court wednesday allowed tax and welfare offices to peek into citizens ' bank accounts if they suspect fraud or tax evasion .
critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .
" people should ask their tax office for an explanation if they receive notices from the bank .

critics fear a breach of personal rights . the law to " promote tax honesty , " which goes into effect april 1 , permits officials in germany to identify an account holder 's name , date of birth , address and the dates the account was opened and closed .
banks need only share the balance , deposit and withdrawal information when the account is not declared to investigators .
the government wants to introduce this legislation because revenues from capital gains tax have fallen in recent years and an amnesty for tax dodgers introduced last year has failed to achieve the desired results .
in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .

legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .

in its decision , the german constitutional court rejected calls by a german bank , an unidentified lawyer , a notary , a recipient of welfare payments and a woman receiving housing subsidies that the law should n't take effect as it would breach citizens ' personal rights .
under legislation designed to detect money laundering , financial regulator bafin can access information such as a customer 's name and birth date and when an account is opened .
the law taking effect april 1 will extend that access to tax offices , social service departments and labor agencies .
it does n't require evidence of wrongdoing or giving the client prior notification .
the karlsruhe-based court assured that the law could only be invoked when the authorities suspect that an offense has been committed .
it also stressed that citizens must also be informed of data checks after they have been carried out and at the very latest before any legal action is taken .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : banks must only provide balance information for undeclared accounts the finance ministry too has assured germans they would be informed whenever their accounts are scrutinized . " the ruling confirms that all remaining concerns about privacy can be ignored , " german finance minister hans eichel 's spokesman stefan giffeler said thursday in a press briefing .
" it also shows how right it is to check bank accounts , especially after the tax amnesty . "
giffeler added , that the bank account checks are an important instrument . " they are fully in line with laws governing date protection .
it is a measure that will be greeted wholeheartedly by all honest taxpayers . “ eichel introduced a tax amnesty at the start of 2004 for a 15-month period in an attempt to crack down on tax evaders both inside and outside germany .
income declared by the end of last year was taxed at 25 percent , while payments in the first three months of this year fall into a 35 percent tax bracket .
the government had received total revenue of " slightly more than 1 billion euros " -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- by the end of february , giffeler said .
invasion of personal rights but , despite the assurances , critics , including politicians , lawmakers , banking groups and data protection officials , fear an orwellian-style snooping in private lives and say the law has nothing to do with tax honesty .
" there is this bogeyman being created in germany , as if we were a country of tax evaders and that everyone has to protect their accounts , " green party financial expert christine scheel told german public broadcaster rbb on thursday in response to concerns about how the law will affect people 's privacy .
privacy rights groups want to see the ministry 's boundaries regarding how and when officials can look into accounts written into the law , a change german finance minster hans eichel refused .
the groups also question whether the law will enable tax offices to uncover enough irregularities to warrant the invasion into banks ' traditional right to confidentiality .
" the real hard cases do not have their accounts in germany , " dieter ondracek , head of the german tax union , told the dpa news agency .
some of the most vehement criticism of the law came from the business-friendly free democrat party .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp chairman guido westerwelle " the lifting of bank confidentiality puts every citizen with an account at any bank under general suspicion of having committed a crime , " said guido westerwelle -lrb- photo -rrb- , fdp chairman , who also called for the law to be overturned .
legal battle continues even after the court 's decision , which stated that the law 's downsides are " less than those that would occur if the law did not go into effect , " the bank and bank customer who brought the original legal challenge maintain that they will try to overturn the law by contesting its constitutionality .
this additional suit , however , could last months and until then the plantiff bank in raesfeld called on the officials only to use their new powers only when " irrefutably necessary . "
" my doubts about the law 's constitutionality have not be cleared , " said peter schaar , the federal commissioner for data protection .
" people should ask their tax office for an explanation if they receive notices from the bank .

the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 24.03.2005 germany debates physician-assisted death großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a question of life and death the debate over whether us patient terri schiavo should be kept alive after 15 years in a vegetative state has sparked discussion about physician-assisted death in germany .
the legal situation however is far from clear . seven to eight million people have written living wills in germany , but there are 250 different versions of the document in the case of critical illness .
and whether they hold up legally is an open question . there 's a huge discrepancy in the law , explained ulrike riedel , a lawyer and member of the government 's commission of inquiry on the ethical and legal matters of medicine .
" the commission of inquiry decided in favor of a very strict limit of range .
we said that because it is so difficult to interpret a will written in advance , we will simply install an objective limit .
that means that if someone is n't fatally ill , he must continue to be treated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte zypries but the german government wants to eliminate the ambiguity .
justice minister brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- drafted a bill last year to allow people to decide for themselves whether life-sustaining machines or medication should be withheld if they became fatally ill .
but in the face of heavy criticism she rescinded the proposal in february .
political parties divided now it 's up to the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , to confront the divisive issue .
the two sides which cross party lines , either favor the justice minister 's liberal approach or the more restrictive stance brought forward by the ethics commission , which puts patients ' health before their wishes . a first bill is expected to be drafted before the bundestag session ends in the summer , and government insiders predict a law will passed in summer 2006 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hands clasped with person in hospital bed a federal court decided in 2003 that living wills are binding for doctors and caregivers , but life-sustaining measures can only be suspended if the illness is fatal .
the main issue is whether patients whose condition is n't necessarily fatal - largely those plagued by severe dementia or suspended in a persistent vegetative state - will be permitted to have treatment suspended .
judging what one ca n't judge after around three months in a coma , it 's very rare that patients are ever able to lead a normal life again , explained christoph müller-busch , a berlin doctor who advises the justice minister . but müller-busch , like riedel , pointed out that one of the difficulties is whether the patient has written his living will before falling ill or afterwards . " you do n't know how you will feel if you 've really got dementia .
you do n't know how you 'll feel if you 're in a somnolent condition , if you want to be treated or not when you 're in the process of losing consciousness .
you make a living will for a time , for a situation , that you ca n't judge , " said riedel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terminally-ill diane pretty at a press conference in london , on april 29 , 2002 after she lost her right-to-die case at the european court of human rights .
the fact is that doctors do n't know what coma patients experience , whether they actually suffer from things like lack of communication or artificial respiration , müller-busch said .
and until new legislation comes into effect , the 12,000 comatose patients in germany who could theoretically recover one day will be kept alive at all costs . judith hartl -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europeans reflect on schiavo case the legislative and judicial battle over a florida man 's right to end his comatose wife 's life has drawn some surprise reaction in europe , where legal sympathy for euthanasia is widespread .
-lrb- march 23 , 2005 -rrb- belgium decriminalises mercy killing in the footsteps of its dutch neighbours , belgium has become the world 's second country to allow euthanasia .
the decision comes a week after the death of terminally-ill euthanasia campaigner diane pretty .

this village of 3,500 people boasts of being the birthplace of " nanus hortorum vulgaris " , or the common garden gnome , which local folklore says was dreamed up by a local potter in 1880 . the craftsmen of the village , including reinhard 's great-grandfather , wasted no time in capitalizing on the idea and , in the land where the brothers grimm created snow white and the seven dwarfs , the popularity of gnomes spread fast . " with his red hat , his lantern , his wheelbarrow and his basket on his back , he is the very image of the miners who used to work in this region , " reinhard said .
" he 's small enough to worm through the mineshafts and always full of the joys of life .

" from my apartment through television , i am spiritually amongst you , my beloved , " the 84-year-old pope said in a message read out by italian cardinal giovanni battista re at a holy thursday ceremony . battista re paid tribute to john paul ii 's stoicism , saying his suffering was a " serene example of his abandonment to god which links him to the mystery of the cross . " the chrismal mass , in which the holy oils used in liturgical ceremonies throughout the year are blessed , was to be followed later thursday by an even more solemn ceremony in which catholics commemorate christ 's last supper . battista re was standing in for the pope , missing the easter ceremonies for the first time in his 26-year pontificate , as ranks of cardinals , bishops , priests and pilgrims packed st. peter 's and choral music swept through the renaissance basilica . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman holding a rosary prays for pope john paul ii 's health .

" still echoes around erfurt and now in red lake on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago . the latest school shooting in the united states brought back some very painful memories for the people of erfurt , germany . monday 's killings at the red lake high school in minnesota in which 16-year-old jeff weise shot and killed 10 people , including himself , reopened emotional wounds which have yet to heal in the small german town , the scene of one of europe 's bloodiest school massacre three years ago . erfurt ’ s mayor manfred ruge was amongst the first to express his condolences to the victims and their relatives when the news about the shootings in minnesota became known . erfurt 's mayor offers advice from the heart ruge had first hand experience of such a tragedy when , in april 2002 , robert steinhäuser , who had been expelled from the erfurt 's gutenberg high school , killed twelve teachers , a secretary , two students , a police officer and himself .
from the mayor 's own experience three years ago , ruge made it clear that attention is what the people in red lake now need most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering the erfurt tragedy " i would recommend to the administration of red lake : listen to the families .
listen to what they need , " erfurt 's mayor told reporters .
" don ’ t just stay in contact with them : seek out contact with them . because only when people listen to each other , and give courage to each other to express their feelings , then can they help each other . " in their shock three years ago , many germans said publicly that while this sort of thing happens in america , it shouldn ’ t happen here , citing europe 's tighter gun control laws . now following red lake , european editorial writers have turned on the bush administration for not curbing gun ownership .
but mayor ruge doesn ’ t agree . strict gun laws ca n't stop the determined " there ’ s an official statistic in germany which suggests that at least two-thirds of weapons owned by citizens here are illegal . this is a social problem . a large number of germans can get a weapon when they want one , " ruge said . he is convinced that such killings could happen in germany again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floral tributes in erfurt " many of my colleagues made clear that in their school , there have been violence and threats . it just never got to the point where a student killed so many other students and teachers .
in germany , violence in schools is a daily problem . " indeed , in july 2003 , the unthinkable almost happened again .
a 16-year-old boy at a school in the bavarian town of coburg died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of the erfurt school shooting a year before . according to witnesses at the time , the coburg pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , who stood just a few meters in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial outside the coburg school unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as a school counselor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself . school killings not just us phenomenon north america and europe are not the only continents affected by school murders .
in the last year alone , there have been six incidents reported in china .
nine people in total were killed in the attacks which were carried out with knives .
the total would have been a lot higher had the assailants had the same access to guns as those in the us and germany . erik campano -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

" still echoes around erfurt and now in red lake on monday , a pupil entered the red lake high school in minnesota and killed ten people .
the killings stirred painful memories in the german town of erfurt , which endured its own massacre three years ago . the latest school shooting in the united states brought back some very painful memories for the people of erfurt , germany . monday 's killings at the red lake high school in minnesota in which 16-year-old jeff weise shot and killed 10 people , including himself , reopened emotional wounds which have yet to heal in the small german town , the scene of one of europe 's bloodiest school massacre three years ago . erfurt ’ s mayor manfred ruge was amongst the first to express his condolences to the victims and their relatives when the news about the shootings in minnesota became known . erfurt 's mayor offers advice from the heart ruge had first hand experience of such a tragedy when , in april 2002 , robert steinhäuser , who had been expelled from the erfurt 's gutenberg high school , killed twelve teachers , a secretary , two students , a police officer and himself .
from the mayor 's own experience three years ago , ruge made it clear that attention is what the people in red lake now need most . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : remembering the erfurt tragedy " i would recommend to the administration of red lake : listen to the families .
listen to what they need , " erfurt 's mayor told reporters .
" don ’ t just stay in contact with them : seek out contact with them . because only when people listen to each other , and give courage to each other to express their feelings , then can they help each other . " in their shock three years ago , many germans said publicly that while this sort of thing happens in america , it shouldn ’ t happen here , citing europe 's tighter gun control laws . now following red lake , european editorial writers have turned on the bush administration for not curbing gun ownership .
but mayor ruge doesn ’ t agree . strict gun laws ca n't stop the determined " there ’ s an official statistic in germany which suggests that at least two-thirds of weapons owned by citizens here are illegal . this is a social problem . a large number of germans can get a weapon when they want one , " ruge said . he is convinced that such killings could happen in germany again . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : floral tributes in erfurt " many of my colleagues made clear that in their school , there have been violence and threats . it just never got to the point where a student killed so many other students and teachers .
in germany , violence in schools is a daily problem . " indeed , in july 2003 , the unthinkable almost happened again .
a 16-year-old boy at a school in the bavarian town of coburg died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of the erfurt school shooting a year before . according to witnesses at the time , the coburg pupil stood up from his chair during a biology class , pulled out a weapon and fired at the teacher , who stood just a few meters in front of him . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : memorial outside the coburg school unharmed , the teacher and the other students were able to escape from the room .
a second teacher who also worked as a school counselor then attempted to approach the pupil and was hit in the leg when she tried to seize the gun .
police say the pupil then pulled out another weapon and shot himself . school killings not just us phenomenon north america and europe are not the only continents affected by school murders .
in the last year alone , there have been six incidents reported in china .
nine people in total were killed in the attacks which were carried out with knives .
the total would have been a lot higher had the assailants had the same access to guns as those in the us and germany . erik campano -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de student killed in school shooting spree a 16-year-old boy at a bavarian school died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on wednesday morning after shooting his teacher in the leg in an incident reminiscent of germany 's own columbine .

experts say german history lessons are skewed , giving too much weight to the holocaust and failing to teach kids about the rich heritage of german jewry , in which jews were much more than merely the nazis ' victims . germany is socially , culturally and economically poorer since the nazi 's reign of terror killed or chased away most of the country 's jews .
experts agree that school kids do n't know that because they receive a one-sided view of jews as having been little more than the persecuted victims of german history .
they never get wind of the fact that jews contributed vastly to german society .
and it 's something that some people are trying to change . " in german school books and classes there is a sole emphasis on the years of the holocaust , between 1933 and 1945 , " said frankfurt jewish museum director georg heuberger .
" the fate of the jews in nazi germany should be studied in a much broader context .
it should be integrated in 2,000 years of history of the jews in germany . " heuberger was part of an illustrious panel commissioned by the leo baeck institute -lrb- lbi -rrb- , an international organization devoted to the study of german jewry , to draft guidelines to ensure that pupils learn that jews have played a fundamental - and positive - role in european and german culture .
with support from germany 's largest teachers ' union , the gew , and the association of history teachers in germany , the lbi has launched a campaign to convince educational authorities , schoolbook publishers and teacher trainers to change their methods . germany without einstein ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moses mendelssohn -lrb- 1729-1786 -rrb- german culture would be unthinkable without the contributions of jews of the german-speaking world , including enlightenment-age philosopher moses mendelssohn , poet heinrich heine , physicists albert einstein and lise meitner , composer arnold schönberg , filmmaker fritz lang , philosopher hannah arendt and marlene dietrich 's longtime songwriter , friedrich hollaender . silvia haslauer has been teaching history and german at jules verne comprehensive school in berlin 's hellersdorf district since 2002 .
her wards are between 17 and 19 years old , when students prepare for and take germany 's grueling final exams to earn their ticket to university , the abitur .
haslauer said that teachers and their trainers are indeed sensitive to the problem of ensuring pupils receive a differentiated view of german-jewish history . " already in teacher training we examined the problem of jews only being presented in the role of victims , " haslauer explained .
her instructor stressed the merits of field trips to teach kids about german-jewish history .

experts say german history lessons are skewed , giving too much weight to the holocaust and failing to teach kids about the rich heritage of german jewry , in which jews were much more than merely the nazis ' victims . germany is socially , culturally and economically poorer since the nazi 's reign of terror killed or chased away most of the country 's jews .
experts agree that school kids do n't know that because they receive a one-sided view of jews as having been little more than the persecuted victims of german history .
they never get wind of the fact that jews contributed vastly to german society .
and it 's something that some people are trying to change . " in german school books and classes there is a sole emphasis on the years of the holocaust , between 1933 and 1945 , " said frankfurt jewish museum director georg heuberger .
" the fate of the jews in nazi germany should be studied in a much broader context .
it should be integrated in 2,000 years of history of the jews in germany . " heuberger was part of an illustrious panel commissioned by the leo baeck institute -lrb- lbi -rrb- , an international organization devoted to the study of german jewry , to draft guidelines to ensure that pupils learn that jews have played a fundamental - and positive - role in european and german culture .
with support from germany 's largest teachers ' union , the gew , and the association of history teachers in germany , the lbi has launched a campaign to convince educational authorities , schoolbook publishers and teacher trainers to change their methods . germany without einstein ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moses mendelssohn -lrb- 1729-1786 -rrb- german culture would be unthinkable without the contributions of jews of the german-speaking world , including enlightenment-age philosopher moses mendelssohn , poet heinrich heine , physicists albert einstein and lise meitner , composer arnold schönberg , filmmaker fritz lang , philosopher hannah arendt and marlene dietrich 's longtime songwriter , friedrich hollaender . silvia haslauer has been teaching history and german at jules verne comprehensive school in berlin 's hellersdorf district since 2002 .
her wards are between 17 and 19 years old , when students prepare for and take germany 's grueling final exams to earn their ticket to university , the abitur .
haslauer said that teachers and their trainers are indeed sensitive to the problem of ensuring pupils receive a differentiated view of german-jewish history . " already in teacher training we examined the problem of jews only being presented in the role of victims , " haslauer explained .
her instructor stressed the merits of field trips to teach kids about german-jewish history .
" we dealt with it through excursions . " haslauer takes her pupils on school trips to concentration camps , synagogues and jewish cemeteries .
she says that especially going to auschwitz is productive , because there " kids see that there was much more than just persecution . "

" there will be no trial anymore as mr -lrb- heinrich -rrb- gross is not mentally able to stand trial , " justice ministry spokesman michael standl told afp .
" it is a definite and final decision . " gross , 89 , worked at the am spiegelgrund hospital in vienna , where 789 sick and disabled children died after the nazis , who supported euthanizing the handicapped , annexed austria in 1938 . nine counts of murder he was briefly jailed after the war .
in the early 1980s , a criminal court ignored a finding in a civil case that he was guilty of manslaughter . gross was again brought to trial in the late 1990s - and charged with nine counts of murder - after a former patient on whom he had allegedly experimented recognized him and realized he was working as a forensic psychiatrist for the austrian justice ministry . the case was partly built on a document found in the archives of the former east german secret police , the stasi , which showed that gross had been directly involved in the clinic . but on march 21 , 2000 he was declared unfit to stand trial because of his poor health . standl said there had been new petitions to the justice ministry since , and that gross had been examined by doctors last year who all concluded that he was mentally unstable .
parliament was informed of the decision by justice minister karen miklautsch this week . " the condition is purely mental , " standl said .
" he was examined three times by a doctor in the summer , and others ... agreed with him . " he said gross managed to work as a forensic psychiatrist until 1997 at vienna 's regional criminal court and others in the capital " because the people did not know who he was . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children in the hell of a concentration camp the decision is a " scandal " green party mp karl oellinger said the decision was a " scandal " and that gross had fooled doctors and the courts . " for decades as a forensic psychiatrist he decided who was fit to stand trial and who was not , " he said . " and then he is brought to trial and suddenly he is unfit to stand trial . " " the justice ministry has always held a protective hand over heinz gross .
it is very happy to close this case .
it is a scandal and a shame . " standl said gross was the last nazi against whom charges were still being investigated in austria . " there are no other cases , " he said . johann gross -lrb- no relation -rrb- , a former victim of the psychiatrist , said he was not surprised by the justice ministry 's decision . " he still has a lobby behind him , " he told afp .
" it is in the justice ministry 's interest that nothing happens to him because he wrote 60,000 certificates for them in his 30-year career " as a court psychiatrist . gross said he had been a state witness at the trial in the late 1990s , whom he met when he spent several months in am spiegelgrund when he was a young boy . " i still bear the scars , " he said .
" i was given injections , it took the form of punishment because i tried to run away repeatedly .
i doubt that he is insane .
we saw him in the media expressing himself clearly , with all his faculties .
the story reminds one of -lrb- former chilean dictator augusto -rrb- pinochet . " horrifying tests the extent to which euthanasia was practised by nazis in austria came to light when hundreds of jars holding body parts of dead children in formaldehyde were found in the cellar of am spiegelgrund . test were carried out on some of the remains , which showed traces of lethal drugs , before they were handed to families for burial . academics recently said they had found a document with hitler 's letterhead and signature in which the dictator ordered the euthanasia of mentally and physically disabled people . hitler 's reportedly schizophrenic niece aloisia died in the gas chambers at hartheim near the austrian city of linz . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : mengele hometown opens victim memorial the hometown of nazi war criminal josef mengele opened a memorial to his victims tuesday aimed as an indelible reminder of the horrors of german history .

a panel is expected to discuss how to replace an estimated 500,000 migrants who left under an amnesty that allowed them to avoid various punishments .
malaysians have been told to take the jobs themselves .
but unemployment is low except among graduates , who have shown no interest in the dirty low-paid jobs on offer .
factories , restaurants , construction sites and palm oil plantations need workers .
new recruits the workers who left were mostly from indonesia , but attempts to help them return legally have foundered .
the malaysians are blaming indonesian bureaucracy and the high charges imposed there for processing work permits .
the cabinet committee is expected to try to speed the recruitment of replacements from india , sri lanka , burma , nepal and pakistan .
but some critics have suggested plans to attract 100,000 pakistani workers could leave the door open to those with links to violent militant groups such as al-qaeda .
the authorities in kuala lumpur and islamabad had given assurances that all would undergo criminal and security background checks before travelling to malaysia .
however , malaysia 's home minister now says that only one in 10 chosen at random will be screened .

it marks the end of a six-week period of public consultation during which several hundred people have voiced their views to local councils .
the plans affect those in areas covered by east sussex county council and brighton and hove city council .
plans for an incinerator in newhaven have provoked criticism from local residents and environmental groups .
landfill site the period of consultation is the latest in a chain of events which began as long ago as 1998 , when the first draft plan for dealing with waste was published .
since then residents in various parts of east sussex have fought campaigns against plans for incinerators near their homes , with a proposed scheme for mountfield , near battle , abandoned in december 2004 .
but people living near a landfill site in pebsham , between hastings and bexhill , were disappointed to be told last year it would be staying open until 2008 .
a public inquiry into east sussex county council 's waste plan held last year ended with newhaven being recommended as a suitable site for an incinerator .
the latest plans indicate final chosen schemes being adopted in the spring of 2006 .

the us giant 's vice chairman bob lutz did not say which brand might be discontinued , but described buick and pontiac as " damaged brands " .
his comments come a week after falling sales prompted general motors -lrb- gm -rrb- to announce a profit warning .
gm expects its earnings for 2005 to be down by as much as 80 % , as it struggles to turn its fortunes around .
' righting the ship ' mr lutz , who joined gm from chrysler in 2001 , said buick and pontiac have been damaged by a traditional lack of investment and ongoing falling sales .
the company is currently investing $ 3bn -lrb- £ 1.6bn -rrb- in new models for the two brands .
the threat of -lsb- gm 's -rsb- bankruptcy is absolutely out of the question gm vice chairman bob lutz he said that if some gm brands fail to meet sales projections , " then we would have to take a look at a phase-out " .
mr lutz added : " i hope we do n't have to do that .
what we 've got to do is keep the brands we 've got . "
removing any of gm 's brands would likely mean plant closures and a reduction in the group 's workforce .
gm has already discontinued one of its brands , stopping production of the oldsmobile last year .
mr lutz said gm would record flat us sales for march .
despite debts of $ 300bn across the gm group , he said the threat of bankruptcy was " absolutely out of the question - totally out of the question " , adding that the company was " taking the necessary steps to right this ship . "

steve carell -lrb- right -rrb- plays the boss in the us version of the office actor steve carell , who plays the us answer to ricky gervais ' david brent , had not seen the uk version when he was asked to audition for the office : an american workplace .
after watching one episode , he decided it may not be such a good idea to keep watching .
" at that point , i think i got a little bit hesitant and nervous because ricky gervais is so wonderful and definitive in his portrayal , " carell says .
" so i figured the best thing for me to do was to not watch too much more of him .
there was no way i was going to equal what he did , and i certainly did n't want to try to recreate what he did . "
rather than copy the original characters and scripts , the us cast and crew have taken the same scenario and tailored it for an american audience .
ricky gervais -lrb- right -rrb- co-created and starred in the british version carell , who has appeared in films bruce almighty and anchorman , used brent 's mould to create an all-american idiot .
so brent , the bumbling boss who became a british icon , has become michael scott from scranton , pennsylvania .
" i figured a blank slate was the best opportunity for me to create any sort of character that might have a life of its own , " he says .
while the style and tone are familiar , the us version looks and feels more like an american show .
after the original was the surprise winner of two golden globes in 2004 , the early signs are that the remake may have found a way to maintain the magic .
" it was no-one 's intention to be better than or to equal the bbc version , " carell says .
" just to make a very funny , rich show based on that template . "
carell -lrb- right -rrb- also starred in movie comedy anchorman with input from gervais and writing partner stephen merchant , the us series has been overseen by greg daniels , who co-created king of the hill and worked on seinfeld and the simpsons .
he says there are important " cultural differences " between the two countries and wants american viewers to say " oh my god , that 's exactly how it is in my office " .
they can not relate so closely to the original , which was shown on cable channel bbc america , he says .
despite the changes , mr daniels says the tone of the new version is still " very different from a lot of stuff on american tv " .
he was afraid the nbc network might turn it into just another american tv sitcom , with laughter tracks , beautiful actors and pristine surroundings , he says .
i 'm not expecting it to start off with a huge bang greg daniels executive producer but they were " incredibly supportive of the british original " , shot as a mock documentary , " and wanted to do something different " .
nbc 's mainstream audience may not take to it straight away , he says - and network executives and producers are prepared for that .
" but we 're kind of hoping it 's going to have more of a seinfeld-like story in the ratings - people who really love comedy are going to find it and they 're going to tell their friends .
" but i 'm not expecting it to start off with a huge bang . "
remake risks the office is the latest chapter in a long history of us television executives plundering the best british sitcoms and claiming them as their own , in the search for ratings .
in the 1970s , us remakes of well-loved british series till death do us part , steptoe and son and man about the house all became huge hits with american audiences .
but in recent years , uk comedies have not travelled well .
new versions of coupling , cold feet and two attempts at fawlty towers in the 1980s and 1990s all flopped spectacularly .
david brent would undoubtedly be delighted with his global influence - but it is now up to his american cousin michael scott to keep up the good work .

steve carell -lrb- right -rrb- plays the boss in the us version of the office actor steve carell , who plays the us answer to ricky gervais ' david brent , had not seen the uk version when he was asked to audition for the office : an american workplace .
after watching one episode , he decided it may not be such a good idea to keep watching .
" at that point , i think i got a little bit hesitant and nervous because ricky gervais is so wonderful and definitive in his portrayal , " carell says .
" so i figured the best thing for me to do was to not watch too much more of him .
there was no way i was going to equal what he did , and i certainly did n't want to try to recreate what he did . "
rather than copy the original characters and scripts , the us cast and crew have taken the same scenario and tailored it for an american audience .
ricky gervais -lrb- right -rrb- co-created and starred in the british version carell , who has appeared in films bruce almighty and anchorman , used brent 's mould to create an all-american idiot .
so brent , the bumbling boss who became a british icon , has become michael scott from scranton , pennsylvania .
" i figured a blank slate was the best opportunity for me to create any sort of character that might have a life of its own , " he says .
while the style and tone are familiar , the us version looks and feels more like an american show .
after the original was the surprise winner of two golden globes in 2004 , the early signs are that the remake may have found a way to maintain the magic .
" it was no-one 's intention to be better than or to equal the bbc version , " carell says .
" just to make a very funny , rich show based on that template . "
carell -lrb- right -rrb- also starred in movie comedy anchorman with input from gervais and writing partner stephen merchant , the us series has been overseen by greg daniels , who co-created king of the hill and worked on seinfeld and the simpsons .
he says there are important " cultural differences " between the two countries and wants american viewers to say " oh my god , that 's exactly how it is in my office " .
they can not relate so closely to the original , which was shown on cable channel bbc america , he says .
despite the changes , mr daniels says the tone of the new version is still " very different from a lot of stuff on american tv " .
he was afraid the nbc network might turn it into just another american tv sitcom , with laughter tracks , beautiful actors and pristine surroundings , he says .
i 'm not expecting it to start off with a huge bang greg daniels executive producer but they were " incredibly supportive of the british original " , shot as a mock documentary , " and wanted to do something different " .
nbc 's mainstream audience may not take to it straight away , he says - and network executives and producers are prepared for that .
" but we 're kind of hoping it 's going to have more of a seinfeld-like story in the ratings - people who really love comedy are going to find it and they 're going to tell their friends .
" but i 'm not expecting it to start off with a huge bang . "
remake risks the office is the latest chapter in a long history of us television executives plundering the best british sitcoms and claiming them as their own , in the search for ratings .
in the 1970s , us remakes of well-loved british series till death do us part , steptoe and son and man about the house all became huge hits with american audiences .

at the opening of a new section of the road tunbridge wells mp archie norman said he was " disappointed " as only a small part of the project was complete .
the conservative mp welcomed the lamberhurst bypass but said other parts of the route are still too dangerous .
transport minister david jamieson said a number of other projects need funding but the a21 was still in the pipeline .
our economy is doing well so we can now afford more of these schemes david jamieson at the opening ceremony on wednesday , mr jamieson added that the government had funded lots of other improvements to the a21 .
" there are a lot of demands for road projects around the country , but especially in the south east .
" our economy is doing well so we can now afford more of these schemes . "
the next section due for improvement between tonbridge and pembury was supposed to be completed by 2006 but that has been put on hold with no alternative date for completion .
mr norman said : " this bypass will allow lamberhurst to be a tranquil kent village again ... but the government have only delivered a tiny little bit of the project . "
the lamberhurst bypass section of the a21 improvement project had been planned for 20 years but work only began two years ago .
it cost £ 12m to complete .

on the programme today we spoke to the author of a guide on how to spot and protect british bumblebees the first comprehensive photographic field guide to the british bumblebee has been written by leading bumblebee authority , mike edwards , and martin jenner , who was on the programme this morning .
martin said the guide is the first comprehensive , photographic guide to bees .
it works by enabling bee spotters to follow three simple steps : step one - look for presence of and number of yellow bands on thorax and find on colour chart step two - cross check with pattern on abdomen and accompanying notes on colour chart step three - confirm identification with photographs and species accounts the new technique could help amateur naturalists and professional field workers in the front line of monitoring decades of decline in britain 's native bumblebees .
the decline has been measured only for a few very rare species but it is clear from surveys that numbers of even the currently most abundant species have gone down .
since the 1970s some species have declined by over 60 per cent .
this is because their natural habitats have been slowly reducing since the 1960s when modern farming was introduced .
flower rich habitats are reducing and therefore nectar - essential to the bees survival is becoming more scarce .
the aim of the guide is to gain a general and more specific idea of insects - how they develop , how they live .
the book is called : ' the field guide to the british bumblebee ' .

martin said the guide is the first comprehensive , photographic guide to bees .
it works by enabling bee spotters to follow three simple steps : step one - look for presence of and number of yellow bands on thorax and find on colour chart step two - cross check with pattern on abdomen and accompanying notes on colour chart step three - confirm identification with photographs and species accounts the new technique could help amateur naturalists and professional field workers in the front line of monitoring decades of decline in britain 's native bumblebees .
the decline has been measured only for a few very rare species but it is clear from surveys that numbers of even the currently most abundant species have gone down .
since the 1970s some species have declined by over 60 per cent .
this is because their natural habitats have been slowly reducing since the 1960s when modern farming was introduced .
flower rich habitats are reducing and therefore nectar - essential to the bees survival is becoming more scarce .
the aim of the guide is to gain a general and more specific idea of insects - how they develop , how they live .
the book is called : ' the field guide to the british bumblebee ' .

a controversial commons science and technology committee report said more decisions on fertility treatment should be made by patients and their doctors .
the mps also called for the regulator , the human fertilisation and embryology authority , to be disbanded .
and they said " taboo " research , such as implanting human cells into animals , should be considered , with regulation .

the report looks at issues across the field of reproductive health .
it said there was no " compelling evidence " to prohibit couples undergoing ivf being able to choose to have a girl or boy if that was what they felt was necessary to " balance out " their family .
fertility expert lord robert winston said he could not see issues with parents being able to choose their babies ' sex , and that the numbers who would want to do so would be very small .
he told bbc radio 4 : " people will not go through ivf to choose the sex of their baby and even if they did it would not in any way , i think , damage the fabric of our society . "

instead , patients and their doctors should decide if it should be used in their case , under the auspices of a local ethics committee , the report said .
standards committee member dr evan harris said : " this is no different to the way in which clinical decisions are made in other areas .
" we are 15 years down the line with ivf .

it calls for a new body , a regulatory agency for fertility and tissues , to be set up in its place which would ensure clinics and laboratories maintained set technical and management standards .
it also says there should be stronger professional regulation , and more government and parliamentary consideration of ethical and legal issues .
the mps ' report also says controversial areas of fertility research should not be shied away from .
it says the creation of so-called " chimeras " , where human cells are placed into an animal foetus , could be useful for research , if created under strict regulations .
the report also attacks rules to be introduced on april 1 to remove anonymity from sperm and egg donors .
the science and technology committee did not unanimously back the report .

suzi leather , chair of the hfea , said the report made " bold and challenging recommendations " .
she added : " the big question for the fertility and research sectors in the future is how we will maintain patient safety , public confidence and minimise risks from developing technologies . "
dr michael wilkes , chairman of the british medical association ethics committee said the association was opposed to sex selection for social reasons , and splitting the work of the hfea .
