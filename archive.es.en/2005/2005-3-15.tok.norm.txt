prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

new confidence data showed that investors are mutedly optimistic with regard to the outlook for the euro zone 's biggest economy in face of a strong euro and high oil prices .
bundesbank president axel weber told a news conference in frankfurt that he expected 2005 to be " another year of modest growth for germany . "

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .

creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker .

daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .

" it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers .

this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .

tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ? in a sign of how much importance germany attaches to tourism and efforts to rebuild areas devastated by december ’ s tsunami , chancellor gerhard schröder was on hand to open this year ’ s itb tourism fair .
he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .
“ that ’ s the only way to help give the region hope for the future .
if tourists stay away , it will hit the people there hard . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beach clean-up on phuket in the fair ’ s asia pavilion , the message to visitors is : come back - our beaches are clean , safe and ready to welcome you .
german appeal to industry but the german government likely won ’ t be thrilled to hear that it ’ s all business as usual .
before the itb opened , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul appealed to the tourism industry to take responsibility for reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas .
the mistakes of the past should not be repeated , she warned .
instead , she called for “ intelligent solutions ” - sustainable tourism that would benefit both tourists and locals and protect the natural beauty of tourist destinations .
in countries such as thailand , where tourism was already highly developed before the tsunami struck , experts at the itb said there ’ s little chance of that happening .
“ the window of opportunity was open briefly , but it has already shut , ” said a german hotelier based on the thai island of phuket .
before the tsunami , patong , the island ’ s most famous town , was known for its crowded strip studded with flashy discos and cocktail bars - and its equally crowded beach .
after the tsunami swept all the beach chairs and vendor stands into the sea , there was talk of redoing the beach more tastefully , with just one or two rows of beach chairs .
“ now , it ’ s already back to four rows , ” he said .
jürgen kripl , a german hotel manager also working in phuket , added that it ’ s been very difficult to check how donations are being used in thailand .
he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .
“ foreign donations could just be used to slap up the same kind of cheap hotels and restaurants that were there before , ” he said .
the german development ministry could have more luck pursuing its vision in countries where the tourism industry still has room to grow - sri lanka , for example .
beyond beaches peter richter , a senior advisor for the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , liases with the private sector in sri lanka to create a better tourism infrastructure and to train locals working in the industry .
the temptation among locals immediately after the tsunami , he said , was to simply get things operational again so tourist dollars would flow as quickly as possible .

as tragic as it was , witcombe said that the tsunami provided an impetus among sri lankans who lost everything in the giant wave to rebuild their tourism industry on a more solid foundation .

tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ? in a sign of how much importance germany attaches to tourism and efforts to rebuild areas devastated by december ’ s tsunami , chancellor gerhard schröder was on hand to open this year ’ s itb tourism fair .
he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .

before the itb opened , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul appealed to the tourism industry to take responsibility for reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas .
the mistakes of the past should not be repeated , she warned .
instead , she called for “ intelligent solutions ” - sustainable tourism that would benefit both tourists and locals and protect the natural beauty of tourist destinations .
in countries such as thailand , where tourism was already highly developed before the tsunami struck , experts at the itb said there ’ s little chance of that happening .
“ the window of opportunity was open briefly , but it has already shut , ” said a german hotelier based on the thai island of phuket .
before the tsunami , patong , the island ’ s most famous town , was known for its crowded strip studded with flashy discos and cocktail bars - and its equally crowded beach .
after the tsunami swept all the beach chairs and vendor stands into the sea , there was talk of redoing the beach more tastefully , with just one or two rows of beach chairs .
“ now , it ’ s already back to four rows , ” he said .
jürgen kripl , a german hotel manager also working in phuket , added that it ’ s been very difficult to check how donations are being used in thailand .
he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .

tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ? in a sign of how much importance germany attaches to tourism and efforts to rebuild areas devastated by december ’ s tsunami , chancellor gerhard schröder was on hand to open this year ’ s itb tourism fair .
he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .
“ that ’ s the only way to help give the region hope for the future .
if tourists stay away , it will hit the people there hard . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beach clean-up on phuket in the fair ’ s asia pavilion , the message to visitors is : come back - our beaches are clean , safe and ready to welcome you .
german appeal to industry but the german government likely won ’ t be thrilled to hear that it ’ s all business as usual .
before the itb opened , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul appealed to the tourism industry to take responsibility for reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas .
the mistakes of the past should not be repeated , she warned .
instead , she called for “ intelligent solutions ” - sustainable tourism that would benefit both tourists and locals and protect the natural beauty of tourist destinations .
in countries such as thailand , where tourism was already highly developed before the tsunami struck , experts at the itb said there ’ s little chance of that happening .
“ the window of opportunity was open briefly , but it has already shut , ” said a german hotelier based on the thai island of phuket .
before the tsunami , patong , the island ’ s most famous town , was known for its crowded strip studded with flashy discos and cocktail bars - and its equally crowded beach .
after the tsunami swept all the beach chairs and vendor stands into the sea , there was talk of redoing the beach more tastefully , with just one or two rows of beach chairs .
“ now , it ’ s already back to four rows , ” he said .
jürgen kripl , a german hotel manager also working in phuket , added that it ’ s been very difficult to check how donations are being used in thailand .
he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .
“ foreign donations could just be used to slap up the same kind of cheap hotels and restaurants that were there before , ” he said .
the german development ministry could have more luck pursuing its vision in countries where the tourism industry still has room to grow - sri lanka , for example .
beyond beaches peter richter , a senior advisor for the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , liases with the private sector in sri lanka to create a better tourism infrastructure and to train locals working in the industry .
the temptation among locals immediately after the tsunami , he said , was to simply get things operational again so tourist dollars would flow as quickly as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists to sri lanka could join the locals in picking tea as part of an ecotourism experience but together with german business consultant wilja witcombe , he ’ s promoting the “ beyond beaches ” campaign , training locals how to offer tourists alternative packages around other aspects of sri lanka - nature , wildlife , culture and wellness . “ some fishermen in sri lanka do not want to go back out to sea because of the tsunami , so we are helping them to become tour guides of their area , training them in biodiversity , the ecosystem , things of relevance in their regions , and they can be part of the ecotourism trend , ” said witcombe .
as tragic as it was , witcombe said that the tsunami provided an impetus among sri lankans who lost everything in the giant wave to rebuild their tourism industry on a more solid foundation .
“ i think people are very aware of the need to do things differently , ” she said .
“ the tsunami gave us a big push forward to get our message about alternative tourism across faster , and now , the people who didn ’ t listen before , and even laughed at our efforts , are listening . ”

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .

" company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .

an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .
" everyone can decide freely when and where , and above all , for how much he or she wants to work .
but only when wages fall can companies , households , entrepreneurs and freelancers create work again .
that 's the core of our premise . " smacks of slavery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jobdumping.de users say it 's better than waiting around at the labor office .
still , some german labor market experts have had harsh words for the internet site .
dirk niebel of the liberal democratic party even went so far as to call the premise " immoral " in an interview printed in the berliner zeitung on tuesday . " i find it strange , " he said .
" it smacks of a slave market .
anyone willing to work like this ca n't be especially motivated , and how should they be ?
quality work under such circumstances is impossible . " a few precautions are built in to the jobdumping.de system , however .
first there 's an absolute minimum wage of € 3 -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- per hour .
and , as with ebay , there 's also a ratings system , borrowed from the grading system used in german schools .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .

i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .
i try to remember if i still have some of my childhood comics lying around at home . kay-alexander scholz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

"
non-compliance of the rules can lead to termination . translation problems the german management of the company said they adopted the code after increasing requests by their american counterparts to do so .
still , representatives of employees say they will fight the code through the courts .
the company declined comment . employee 's rights expert manfred confurius told the financial times deutschland that us employees face more concrete and stronger restrictions , something that does n't always transfer well to german work culture .

before the itb opened , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul appealed to the tourism industry to take responsibility for reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas .
the mistakes of the past should not be repeated , she warned .
instead , she called for “ intelligent solutions ” - sustainable tourism that would benefit both tourists and locals and protect the natural beauty of tourist destinations .
in countries such as thailand , where tourism was already highly developed before the tsunami struck , experts at the itb said there ’ s little chance of that happening .
“ the window of opportunity was open briefly , but it has already shut , ” said a german hotelier based on the thai island of phuket .
before the tsunami , patong , the island ’ s most famous town , was known for its crowded strip studded with flashy discos and cocktail bars - and its equally crowded beach .
after the tsunami swept all the beach chairs and vendor stands into the sea , there was talk of redoing the beach more tastefully , with just one or two rows of beach chairs .
“ now , it ’ s already back to four rows , ” he said .
jürgen kripl , a german hotel manager also working in phuket , added that it ’ s been very difficult to check how donations are being used in thailand .
he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .
“ foreign donations could just be used to slap up the same kind of cheap hotels and restaurants that were there before , ” he said .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2005 art seeks money at ' cartoon movie ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european animators are hoping for a cash infusion for their art european animated film makers can have a hard time when it comes to competing with the united states .
dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .
i try to remember if i still have some of my childhood comics lying around at home . kay-alexander scholz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ? in a sign of how much importance germany attaches to tourism and efforts to rebuild areas devastated by december ’ s tsunami , chancellor gerhard schröder was on hand to open this year ’ s itb tourism fair .
he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .

before the itb opened , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul appealed to the tourism industry to take responsibility for reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas .
the mistakes of the past should not be repeated , she warned .
instead , she called for “ intelligent solutions ” - sustainable tourism that would benefit both tourists and locals and protect the natural beauty of tourist destinations .
in countries such as thailand , where tourism was already highly developed before the tsunami struck , experts at the itb said there ’ s little chance of that happening .
“ the window of opportunity was open briefly , but it has already shut , ” said a german hotelier based on the thai island of phuket .
before the tsunami , patong , the island ’ s most famous town , was known for its crowded strip studded with flashy discos and cocktail bars - and its equally crowded beach .
after the tsunami swept all the beach chairs and vendor stands into the sea , there was talk of redoing the beach more tastefully , with just one or two rows of beach chairs .
“ now , it ’ s already back to four rows , ” he said .
jürgen kripl , a german hotel manager also working in phuket , added that it ’ s been very difficult to check how donations are being used in thailand .
he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .

the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .

the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .
" everyone can decide freely when and where , and above all , for how much he or she wants to work .
but only when wages fall can companies , households , entrepreneurs and freelancers create work again .
that 's the core of our premise . " smacks of slavery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jobdumping.de users say it 's better than waiting around at the labor office .
still , some german labor market experts have had harsh words for the internet site .
dirk niebel of the liberal democratic party even went so far as to call the premise " immoral " in an interview printed in the berliner zeitung on tuesday . " i find it strange , " he said .
" it smacks of a slave market .
anyone willing to work like this ca n't be especially motivated , and how should they be ?
quality work under such circumstances is impossible . " a few precautions are built in to the jobdumping.de system , however .
first there 's an absolute minimum wage of € 3 -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- per hour .
and , as with ebay , there 's also a ratings system , borrowed from the grading system used in german schools .
" jobdumpers " can judge each other ranging from a " six " for poor performance , to a " one " for a job well done . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping production in germany , but for less pay with germany ’ s high labor costs , many companies are relocating their production to cheaper places .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .

or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .

knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .
" everyone can decide freely when and where , and above all , for how much he or she wants to work .
but only when wages fall can companies , households , entrepreneurs and freelancers create work again .
that 's the core of our premise . " smacks of slavery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jobdumping.de users say it 's better than waiting around at the labor office .
still , some german labor market experts have had harsh words for the internet site .
dirk niebel of the liberal democratic party even went so far as to call the premise " immoral " in an interview printed in the berliner zeitung on tuesday . " i find it strange , " he said .
" it smacks of a slave market .
anyone willing to work like this ca n't be especially motivated , and how should they be ?
quality work under such circumstances is impossible . " a few precautions are built in to the jobdumping.de system , however .
first there 's an absolute minimum wage of € 3 -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- per hour .
and , as with ebay , there 's also a ratings system , borrowed from the grading system used in german schools .
" jobdumpers " can judge each other ranging from a " six " for poor performance , to a " one " for a job well done . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping production in germany , but for less pay with germany ’ s high labor costs , many companies are relocating their production to cheaper places .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2005 art seeks money at ' cartoon movie ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european animators are hoping for a cash infusion for their art european animated film makers can have a hard time when it comes to competing with the united states .
dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .
i try to remember if i still have some of my childhood comics lying around at home . kay-alexander scholz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .
i try to remember if i still have some of my childhood comics lying around at home . kay-alexander scholz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .
" everyone can decide freely when and where , and above all , for how much he or she wants to work .

that 's the core of our premise . " smacks of slavery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jobdumping.de users say it 's better than waiting around at the labor office .
still , some german labor market experts have had harsh words for the internet site .
dirk niebel of the liberal democratic party even went so far as to call the premise " immoral " in an interview printed in the berliner zeitung on tuesday . " i find it strange , " he said .
" it smacks of a slave market .
anyone willing to work like this ca n't be especially motivated , and how should they be ?
quality work under such circumstances is impossible . " a few precautions are built in to the jobdumping.de system , however .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .

he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .

he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2005 art seeks money at ' cartoon movie ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european animators are hoping for a cash infusion for their art european animated film makers can have a hard time when it comes to competing with the united states .
dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .
i try to remember if i still have some of my childhood comics lying around at home . kay-alexander scholz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.03.2005 ebay for the working world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaning jobs are frequently up for grabs on jobdumping.de when fabian löw unleashed jobdumping.de on the internet , he had an inkling it would be provocative .
because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .
" everyone can decide freely when and where , and above all , for how much he or she wants to work .
but only when wages fall can companies , households , entrepreneurs and freelancers create work again .
that 's the core of our premise . " smacks of slavery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jobdumping.de users say it 's better than waiting around at the labor office .
still , some german labor market experts have had harsh words for the internet site .
dirk niebel of the liberal democratic party even went so far as to call the premise " immoral " in an interview printed in the berliner zeitung on tuesday . " i find it strange , " he said .
" it smacks of a slave market .
anyone willing to work like this ca n't be especially motivated , and how should they be ?
quality work under such circumstances is impossible . " a few precautions are built in to the jobdumping.de system , however .
first there 's an absolute minimum wage of € 3 -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- per hour .
and , as with ebay , there 's also a ratings system , borrowed from the grading system used in german schools .
" jobdumpers " can judge each other ranging from a " six " for poor performance , to a " one " for a job well done . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping production in germany , but for less pay with germany ’ s high labor costs , many companies are relocating their production to cheaper places .

tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ? in a sign of how much importance germany attaches to tourism and efforts to rebuild areas devastated by december ’ s tsunami , chancellor gerhard schröder was on hand to open this year ’ s itb tourism fair .
he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .
“ that ’ s the only way to help give the region hope for the future .

tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ? in a sign of how much importance germany attaches to tourism and efforts to rebuild areas devastated by december ’ s tsunami , chancellor gerhard schröder was on hand to open this year ’ s itb tourism fair .
he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .
“ that ’ s the only way to help give the region hope for the future .
if tourists stay away , it will hit the people there hard . ”

german appeal to industry but the german government likely won ’ t be thrilled to hear that it ’ s all business as usual .
before the itb opened , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul appealed to the tourism industry to take responsibility for reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas .
the mistakes of the past should not be repeated , she warned .
instead , she called for “ intelligent solutions ” - sustainable tourism that would benefit both tourists and locals and protect the natural beauty of tourist destinations .
in countries such as thailand , where tourism was already highly developed before the tsunami struck , experts at the itb said there ’ s little chance of that happening .
“ the window of opportunity was open briefly , but it has already shut , ” said a german hotelier based on the thai island of phuket .
before the tsunami , patong , the island ’ s most famous town , was known for its crowded strip studded with flashy discos and cocktail bars - and its equally crowded beach .
after the tsunami swept all the beach chairs and vendor stands into the sea , there was talk of redoing the beach more tastefully , with just one or two rows of beach chairs .
“ now , it ’ s already back to four rows , ” he said .
jürgen kripl , a german hotel manager also working in phuket , added that it ’ s been very difficult to check how donations are being used in thailand .
he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .
“ foreign donations could just be used to slap up the same kind of cheap hotels and restaurants that were there before , ” he said .
the german development ministry could have more luck pursuing its vision in countries where the tourism industry still has room to grow - sri lanka , for example .
beyond beaches peter richter , a senior advisor for the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , liases with the private sector in sri lanka to create a better tourism infrastructure and to train locals working in the industry .
the temptation among locals immediately after the tsunami , he said , was to simply get things operational again so tourist dollars would flow as quickly as possible .

tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ? in a sign of how much importance germany attaches to tourism and efforts to rebuild areas devastated by december ’ s tsunami , chancellor gerhard schröder was on hand to open this year ’ s itb tourism fair .
he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .
“ that ’ s the only way to help give the region hope for the future .
if tourists stay away , it will hit the people there hard . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beach clean-up on phuket in the fair ’ s asia pavilion , the message to visitors is : come back - our beaches are clean , safe and ready to welcome you .
german appeal to industry but the german government likely won ’ t be thrilled to hear that it ’ s all business as usual .
before the itb opened , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul appealed to the tourism industry to take responsibility for reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas .
the mistakes of the past should not be repeated , she warned .
instead , she called for “ intelligent solutions ” - sustainable tourism that would benefit both tourists and locals and protect the natural beauty of tourist destinations .
in countries such as thailand , where tourism was already highly developed before the tsunami struck , experts at the itb said there ’ s little chance of that happening .
“ the window of opportunity was open briefly , but it has already shut , ” said a german hotelier based on the thai island of phuket .
before the tsunami , patong , the island ’ s most famous town , was known for its crowded strip studded with flashy discos and cocktail bars - and its equally crowded beach .
after the tsunami swept all the beach chairs and vendor stands into the sea , there was talk of redoing the beach more tastefully , with just one or two rows of beach chairs .
“ now , it ’ s already back to four rows , ” he said .
jürgen kripl , a german hotel manager also working in phuket , added that it ’ s been very difficult to check how donations are being used in thailand .
he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .
“ foreign donations could just be used to slap up the same kind of cheap hotels and restaurants that were there before , ” he said .
the german development ministry could have more luck pursuing its vision in countries where the tourism industry still has room to grow - sri lanka , for example .
beyond beaches peter richter , a senior advisor for the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , liases with the private sector in sri lanka to create a better tourism infrastructure and to train locals working in the industry .
the temptation among locals immediately after the tsunami , he said , was to simply get things operational again so tourist dollars would flow as quickly as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists to sri lanka could join the locals in picking tea as part of an ecotourism experience but together with german business consultant wilja witcombe , he ’ s promoting the “ beyond beaches ” campaign , training locals how to offer tourists alternative packages around other aspects of sri lanka - nature , wildlife , culture and wellness . “ some fishermen in sri lanka do not want to go back out to sea because of the tsunami , so we are helping them to become tour guides of their area , training them in biodiversity , the ecosystem , things of relevance in their regions , and they can be part of the ecotourism trend , ” said witcombe .
as tragic as it was , witcombe said that the tsunami provided an impetus among sri lankans who lost everything in the giant wave to rebuild their tourism industry on a more solid foundation .
“ i think people are very aware of the need to do things differently , ” she said .
“ the tsunami gave us a big push forward to get our message about alternative tourism across faster , and now , the people who didn ’ t listen before , and even laughed at our efforts , are listening . ”
early warning system bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's minister for research edelgard bulmahn , right , and her indonesian counterpart kusmayanto kadiman exchange documents after signing an agreement on the building of a tsunami early warning system in jakarta , indonesia .
another mistake of the past - the lack of an early warning system for tsunamis - also looks set to be remedied , something experts at the itb agree will help tourists regain their trust in the region .
germany said it will build a warning system for indonesia as part of its aid commitment to southeast asia .
the global satellite-based system was designed by the helmholtz association , germany ’ s largest research institution .
the geoscience center in potsdam will oversee the € 45 million -lrb- $ 60.3 million -rrb- project to build it and predicts the first buoys could be placed in indonesian waters by october of this year .
the indonesian system can be extended to other countries ; sri lanka has already expressed interest . deanne corbett , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 15.03.2005 art seeks money at ' cartoon movie ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european animators are hoping for a cash infusion for their art european animated film makers can have a hard time when it comes to competing with the united states .
dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .
i try to remember if i still have some of my childhood comics lying around at home . kay-alexander scholz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .
" everyone can decide freely when and where , and above all , for how much he or she wants to work .
but only when wages fall can companies , households , entrepreneurs and freelancers create work again .
that 's the core of our premise . " smacks of slavery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jobdumping.de users say it 's better than waiting around at the labor office .
still , some german labor market experts have had harsh words for the internet site .
dirk niebel of the liberal democratic party even went so far as to call the premise " immoral " in an interview printed in the berliner zeitung on tuesday . " i find it strange , " he said .
" it smacks of a slave market .
anyone willing to work like this ca n't be especially motivated , and how should they be ?
quality work under such circumstances is impossible . " a few precautions are built in to the jobdumping.de system , however .
first there 's an absolute minimum wage of € 3 -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- per hour .
and , as with ebay , there 's also a ratings system , borrowed from the grading system used in german schools .
" jobdumpers " can judge each other ranging from a " six " for poor performance , to a " one " for a job well done . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping production in germany , but for less pay with germany ’ s high labor costs , many companies are relocating their production to cheaper places .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .

food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .

dw-world 's kay-alexander scholz attended an industry meeting in potsdam . when i arrive at the fx-center in potsdam-babelsberg for the " cartoon movie " industry meeting , what i notice first is the forty-somethings .
i had n't expected this - so many of them , and so well dressed .
standing in line at the reception area , i hear a " qui " here , a " sí " there - some russian , some english , all mixed together .
i give my very german name , and the press lady asks , " sorry , could you spell it , please ? " outside , the snowflakes are whirling madly , and inside it is just as energetic .
this is not a trade fair , but an industry meeting , the press spokeswoman explains .
creatives and their executives are meeting with buyers : producers , investors and managers of public investment funds from brussels , paris or leipzig . the heavy hitters from across the atlantic are also represented .
warner , universal , fox .
from the 30-inch monitor at the reception i get that list of attendees .
i 'm impressed . tiny plant vs. boring tree first stop , " the croissant show , sponsored by media desk . "
i grab a coffee .
there are some 400 professionals sitting at each one of the four 20-meter -lrb- 65 foot -rrb- long tables .
they 're bathed in a golden light , and are much too awake for this time of day .
i quickly grab a glass of water . bildunterschrift : banquet room , cartoon movie two hours and a half a dozen talks later , i get what is going on here .
animated movies are damned expensive .
too expensive for one country , too expensive for one investor .
that 's why animated filmmakers create networks . in the united states , the home of walt disney , there are huge budgets for hand-drawn and computer generated big screen features .
not in europe .
the producers of " lauras stern , " thilo graf rothkirch , gives me this image : here in europe , the industry is a weak and tiny little plant – over there it is a massive and mighty tree . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walt disney 's " bambi " but , it 's a boring tree , because american culture , the roots of that tree , is tied to the mainstream .
in comparison , europe 's cultural plant could grow into something very colorful - provided it got enough sun , money and attention . puppets , clay figures , drawn characters , marionettes , fantasies in 3-d ; in fact , the european bag of tricks is full to the brim with diverse creations .
this becomes clear to me during sessions entitled " projects in concept , " " projects in development , " " films in production " and " completed films . " ' producers are idiots ' attending these talks , i sometimes see just drawings , sometimes a trailer , sometimes only motion studies .
when a cute 3-d snowman in one trailer says " producers are idiots , " everyone laughs .
because there is one thing the stylish women and the men in starched shirts know for sure : after cartoon movie , many of their presentations will be relegated to the cold hinterlands of some computer hard drive . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : still from the animated european film " corto maltese " each project presentation gets a mere 15 minutes .
then the jacket pockets get new business cards , the appointment calendar new appointments .
there 's " ffa-lunch , " the sponsored " coffee show " and the " farewell dinner . "
food has a starring role here . the lady from media does n't want to stop talking .
she represents one of the fullest wallets here , that of the european union .
she passionately explains the multi-tiered model of financial support , and why € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- is an appropriate sum for the next seven years .
the eu is bigger , the timetables are longer , thus there is twice as much money to be spent . a maximum of € 80,000 will be awarded as a result of this meeting .
it is n't much .
i am told that some " projects in development " have already burned through € 6 or € 8 million .
not a business for people with weak stomachs .
a film generally takes four to five years to get from the sketch stage to the big screen .
in 2004 , europe produced 750 films , only 15 of which were animated . norwegian marionette epic i ca n't really enjoy my cod in lime sauce .
first , i ca n't find a seat .
then , just as i am about to dig in , the lights go down for a trailer .
finally , i have to defend my narrow space from some loudly gesticulating , wine-slurping frenchmen .
to make up for it , i enjoy a big chunk of tiramisu after most people have already left the room . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund then comes a norwegian film , a mixture of classic marionette theater and " lord of the rings . "
it 's a warrior epic from a long-gone era ; mystical , mythical , filmed in impressive sets and animated by masterful puppeteers .
have you ever seen a marionette swim ?
the " strings " – that 's the title – tie the figures direct to the heavens .
they are their lifelines , and can be cut through with one hand -lrb- suicide -rrb- or lopped off by someone else -lrb- murder -rrb- .
or they can magically double , bringing a character to life -lrb- birth -rrb- . the story knocks me out .
it is tragic and powerful .
i fervently hope " strings " makes it into the movie theaters .
knees trembling , i go get myself a cappuccino . bildunterschrift : " strings " by anders ronnow klarlund industry 's future ? now i am enjoying cartoon movie .
i am intrigued and delighted by the idea that animated film puts no limits on fantasy .
but what kind of a future does this business have ?
cgi animation computers are getting faster and faster .
that 's one point in its favor .
and is n't there a new generation for whom animation is serious business ?
the internet is full of cartoons that have been produced especially for the web .
kids use their playstation editors to make their own little films .
japanese mangas are booming . the snowflakes are still dancing outside the glass windows .
i bid farewell to my new comrades , get in my car and drive back to berlin .
i try to remember if i still have some of my childhood comics lying around at home . kay-alexander scholz -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de where movie money meets euro talent the european film market may not have as much glitz or glamour as the rest of the berlinale , but it 's an important event where european filmmakers meet the people who can potentially guide them towards the red carpet .

tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ? in a sign of how much importance germany attaches to tourism and efforts to rebuild areas devastated by december ’ s tsunami , chancellor gerhard schröder was on hand to open this year ’ s itb tourism fair .
he was the first german leader to speak at the itb in eight years .
germany was one of the biggest donors of relief aid after the tsunami hit and its people are among the world ’ s most prolific travelers .
“ alongside the private and state relief aid there is now one thing that is crucial - tourists should not take their eyes off the affected regions , ” schröder said .
“ that ’ s the only way to help give the region hope for the future .
if tourists stay away , it will hit the people there hard . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beach clean-up on phuket in the fair ’ s asia pavilion , the message to visitors is : come back - our beaches are clean , safe and ready to welcome you .
german appeal to industry but the german government likely won ’ t be thrilled to hear that it ’ s all business as usual .
before the itb opened , german development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul appealed to the tourism industry to take responsibility for reconstruction in tsunami-affected areas .
the mistakes of the past should not be repeated , she warned .
instead , she called for “ intelligent solutions ” - sustainable tourism that would benefit both tourists and locals and protect the natural beauty of tourist destinations .
in countries such as thailand , where tourism was already highly developed before the tsunami struck , experts at the itb said there ’ s little chance of that happening .
“ the window of opportunity was open briefly , but it has already shut , ” said a german hotelier based on the thai island of phuket .
before the tsunami , patong , the island ’ s most famous town , was known for its crowded strip studded with flashy discos and cocktail bars - and its equally crowded beach .
after the tsunami swept all the beach chairs and vendor stands into the sea , there was talk of redoing the beach more tastefully , with just one or two rows of beach chairs .
“ now , it ’ s already back to four rows , ” he said .
jürgen kripl , a german hotel manager also working in phuket , added that it ’ s been very difficult to check how donations are being used in thailand .
he complained of a lack of will among thai businesspeople in the tourism industry to see improvements through .
“ foreign donations could just be used to slap up the same kind of cheap hotels and restaurants that were there before , ” he said .
the german development ministry could have more luck pursuing its vision in countries where the tourism industry still has room to grow - sri lanka , for example .
beyond beaches peter richter , a senior advisor for the german technical assistance service -lrb- gtz -rrb- , liases with the private sector in sri lanka to create a better tourism infrastructure and to train locals working in the industry .
the temptation among locals immediately after the tsunami , he said , was to simply get things operational again so tourist dollars would flow as quickly as possible .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists to sri lanka could join the locals in picking tea as part of an ecotourism experience but together with german business consultant wilja witcombe , he ’ s promoting the “ beyond beaches ” campaign , training locals how to offer tourists alternative packages around other aspects of sri lanka - nature , wildlife , culture and wellness . “ some fishermen in sri lanka do not want to go back out to sea because of the tsunami , so we are helping them to become tour guides of their area , training them in biodiversity , the ecosystem , things of relevance in their regions , and they can be part of the ecotourism trend , ” said witcombe .
as tragic as it was , witcombe said that the tsunami provided an impetus among sri lankans who lost everything in the giant wave to rebuild their tourism industry on a more solid foundation .
“ i think people are very aware of the need to do things differently , ” she said .
“ the tsunami gave us a big push forward to get our message about alternative tourism across faster , and now , the people who didn ’ t listen before , and even laughed at our efforts , are listening . ”

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .

a controversial german artist who works with cadavers faces new controversy after trying to expand to poland , where his father , who leads the project , allegedly served with the ss . gunther von hagens , known for his displays of preserved human corpses stripped of skin and dissected , wants to build a laboratory and warehouse in conservative and staunchly catholic poland to mass-produce his art , local officials told reuters recently .
von hagens has already bought land and industrial buildings in the small , western polish town of sieniawa zarska , population 1,150 , near the german border .
he appointed his father , 88-year-old gerhard liebchen , to set up the project : storing bodies and preparing them for plastination , which replaces body fluids with plastics in order to preserve them .
" his father told us what he plans to do here - von hagen plans to open a plastination factory of human bodies , " senior town official andrzej chwiedacz told reuters .
" von hagen 's father is trying to convince us and our people why it is good for our town . "
the venture promises to eventually employ up to 300 people in the new eu country , where labor costs are far less than in germany and unemployment reaches up to 18 percent .
allegations of abuse bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fueling the fire but things became trickier after german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last month that liebchen " appeared to be actively involved " in the ss and helped carry out nazi repression of poles during world war ii .
the magazine also published a list of 60 people deported in 1940 from the southwestern town of skalmierzyce to concentration camps allegedly based on a list compiled by liebchen .
the polish authorities announced they would examine the allegations , after which von hagen said his father would no longer play a role in the project .
i have only learned of these accusations , including the suggestion that my father was in the ss , in the last few days , " he said in a statement to afp .
" in view of the historical responsibility of germany … it is essential for me that my company be free of any suspicion . "
no stranger to controversy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : instructive or macabre the plastination process , invented by von hagens , is the craft of preserving human bodies by replacing the natural body fluids with solid plastic .
plastination both preserves tissues and gives rigidity , enabling the corpse and the organs to be displayed in exhibitions .
employing the process , von hagens created his " body worlds " exhibition made up of 175 body parts and 25 corpses , including the bisected body of a pregnant woman with her womb cut open to reveal the fetus .
though millions have visited his exhibitions , others have criticized the exhibitions as macabre , exploitive and called him a " modern-day frankenstein . "
he has also faced probes in several countries for breaching laws in his handling of corpses where authorities tried but failed to stop his exhibitions .
last year , german prosecutors became interested after allegations arose accusing him of obtaining and using the bodies of executed prisoners in china .
on march 22 , von hagens goes again before a heidelberg court on charges of illegally using the title of professor , which he received in china .
he has called the charges " absurd .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .

" company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

prosecutors have expanded their investigation into breach of trust allegations at daimlerchrysler .
eleven people are now being probed in connection with various " irregularities " at the stuttgart-based carmaker . " it 's mainly daimlerchrysler employees that are involved , though other people are affected too , " state prosecutors said on monday . the stuttgart-based company would only confirm probes into the activities of three of its managers . " i ca n't rule out that this number will increase , " a company spokeswoman said on monday .
there are still new tips coming in which have to be checked , she added . company insiders have said that the investigations are looking into " a mixture of breach of trust and illegal transactions with new cars . " company-funded holiday home ? some of the allegations center on the use of company resources for private purposes .
this past weekend , the german news magazine focus reported that a former germany sales chief allegedly used company money to build a holiday home for his girlfriend in spain . there are also reports of shady deals in which new cars were sold at a corporate client discount rate to unauthorized dealers .
daimlerchrysler employs a selective distribution system , meaning that unauthorized dealers do n't receive new cars . yet so-called " gray-market " dealers still manage to get hold of new cars , reported die welt on tuesday .
the paper gave an example whereby a dealer claims to have a large fleet of cars , and needs 300 new mercedes for 300 employees .
in this way , the dealer qualifies for a special rebate .
in reality though , the dealer has only three employees , and sells the remaining 297 mercedes as new cars - a punishable offense . the investigations were sparked by anonymous tips of " irregularities , " company spokeswoman ursula mertzig-stein said . last month , daimlerchrysler fired two managers in its german mercedes sales division - jürgen fahr , head of sales , and walter missing , head of the hamburg sales office - in connection with the scandal . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ceos reject disclosing salaries executives of leading german companies have dismissed a government initiative to force publicly traded companies to disclose top managers ' salaries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.03.2005 ebay for the working world großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cleaning jobs are frequently up for grabs on jobdumping.de when fabian löw unleashed jobdumping.de on the internet , he had an inkling it would be provocative .
because at a time when job seekers have it tough , his job auctions are won by those willing to work for the least pay . the concept of jobdumping.de is simple .
an employer posts a job that needs doing , along with the maximum wage he or she is willing to pay .
interested job seekers then compete with each other for the job by underbidding , meaning the employer ends up with the person willing to do the job for the least amount of money . the system can also work the other way , with workers entering their skills in the auction at the minimum price they 're willing to work for , and interested employers then push the wage up as they outbid each other . wages too high bildunterschrift : more germans are turning to the internet to find jobs .
launched in early october , fabian löw 's " ebay for the working world " has attracted plenty of interest , as well as a fair share of criticism .
löw is frequently accused of exploiting the desperation of job seekers at a time when unemployment is at a record high , and laws cutting benefits for the jobless have just been introduced .
the very name " jobdumping.de " has proved to be extremely provocative , just as löw suspected .
so why did he do it ? " wage costs , compared across an inter-european level , are unreasonably high in germany .
they have to be completely renegotiated , " löw told die zeit . löw makes no bones about the fact that he approached the project from the employer 's perspective .
he looks at the situation on the german labor market with cold realism , and does n't shy away from saying things most germans would prefer not to hear - including his view that in future , germans will have to get used to working more . " in the long term , we know that in a few years , we 'll only be able to keep our standard of living by having other jobs on the side , " he said . it sounds a bit callous coming from someone currently studying social work at a catholic technical college in münster .
but löw said he has no moral qualms .
all the users on jobdumping.de are obligated to abide by current tax , labor and insurance laws . " we do n't exploit our members or the unemployment situation , " he told die welt .
" everyone can decide freely when and where , and above all , for how much he or she wants to work .
but only when wages fall can companies , households , entrepreneurs and freelancers create work again .
that 's the core of our premise . " smacks of slavery bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some jobdumping.de users say it 's better than waiting around at the labor office .
still , some german labor market experts have had harsh words for the internet site .
dirk niebel of the liberal democratic party even went so far as to call the premise " immoral " in an interview printed in the berliner zeitung on tuesday . " i find it strange , " he said .
" it smacks of a slave market .
anyone willing to work like this ca n't be especially motivated , and how should they be ?
quality work under such circumstances is impossible . " a few precautions are built in to the jobdumping.de system , however .
first there 's an absolute minimum wage of € 3 -lrb- $ 4 -rrb- per hour .
and , as with ebay , there 's also a ratings system , borrowed from the grading system used in german schools .
" jobdumpers " can judge each other ranging from a " six " for poor performance , to a " one " for a job well done . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping production in germany , but for less pay with germany ’ s high labor costs , many companies are relocating their production to cheaper places .

german soldiers lodged 94 formal complaints of mistreatment compared with 58 in 2003 , according to an annual report submitted to the lower house of parliament , the bundestag .
forty-three of the complaints concerned one barracks , near the western city of münster .

however cases of soldiers showing neo-nazi sympathies dropped slightly to 134 in 2004 against 139 the previous year .
most cases concerned soldiers who had given the ' hitler salute ' or used nazi phrases while they were drunk , the report said .
willfried penner , the military 's representative in parliament , said the report was a " summary of all the army 's shortcomings . " dw-world.de dw-world : when bullies enter the military recent reports of mobbing - bullying - in the german army , the bundeswehr , have caused the nation to look at the phenomenon more closely .

he said the country must be willing to put through more labor market reforms if it wants to put a dent in an unemployment rate at its highest since world war ii .

ms is currently diagnosed through a combination of scans , tests and physical examination , and can be difficult to spot .
but researchers found people with relapsing-remitting ms have a distinct pattern of proteins in their blood .
the wake forest university study features in the journal of molecular neuroscience . "
the prospect of a simple blood test to diagnose ms is extremely attractive " christine jones ms is a progressive disease of the central nervous system that affects the brain and spinal cord .
common signs can include fatigue , psychological changes , weakness or paralysis of limbs , numbness , vision problems , difficulties speaking or walking , bladder problems , and sexual dysfunction .
eventually , patients may become totally paralysed and wheelchair-bound .
sample analysis the wake forest team compared blood samples from 25 patients newly diagnosed with relapsing-remitting ms with samples from 25 healthy people .
relapsing-remitting ms is the most common form of the disease , and is characterised by attacks interspersed with stable periods .
the researchers found that the ms patients had a different pattern of proteins - and their building blocks , peptides - in their blood .
lead researcher dr jagannadha avasarala said : " we found a distinct pattern in the ms group that revealed the existence of three markers for the disease .
" this suggests the potential for developing a blood test that could allow us to identify the earliest changes that represent ms and help in its diagnosis . "
dr avasarala said there was probably not a single marker that could be used to detect ms. looking for patterns across a number of markers was probably a more effective strategy .
the researchers combined an analytical technique called combined mass spectrometry with sophisticated software designed to recognise protein patterns .
diagnosis stressful christine jones , of the ms trust , said : " obviously , this research is at an early stage but the prospect of a simple blood test to diagnose ms is extremely attractive .
" currently , there is no one test that can diagnose ms and the process of identifying people with the condition can be long and stressful , often stretching over a period of months or even years .
" many people with ms say that dealing with the uncertainty during diagnosis is harder than coping with any of the symptoms they ever experience .
" clearly , a test that could provide a rapid and definitive diagnosis would enable those who do have ms to begin receiving treatment and support without delay and would also avoid unnecessary distress for those who are found not to be affected by the condition . "
mike o 'donovan , chief executive of the multiple sclerosis society , said : " this interesting research is at an early stage and we look forward to seeing the results of the further analysis now under way . "

the new measure is a response to criticism of japan 's failure to curb human trafficking .
many filipinos who arrive on such visas end up working in japan 's sex industry .
however , organisations supporting overseas workers from the philippines have expressed concern over the loss of earnings caused by the new rules .
the philippines government is currently negotiating with japan to allow more of its nationals to work in other fields in japan .
between 60,000 and 80,000 filipinos arrive in japan every year on entertainment visas .
this is a euphemistic description for a process whereby most are directed by agents in both countries into japan 's extensive sex industry .
the lucky ones end up in upmarket hostess clubs and bars , where they may be well treated and earn good money .
the less fortunate find themselves working as prostitutes , subject to abuse and given no legal protection .
image problem now the japanese government is trying to clean up the country 's image after criticism by the us state department last year over its failure to control human trafficking .
it wants to cut the number of entertainment visas issued to filipinos to just 8,000 a year by imposing much stricter requirements .
from tuesday , applicants will have to provide a certificate showing they have studied some form of performance art for two years .
however , the new policy is not popular in the philippines .
groups who support overseas workers say most of those who go to japan on entertainment visas are not abused and their families rely on the earnings sent back .
they complain that it contradicts the japanese government 's promise to consider opening up to more foreign labour .
the philippines government is currently pushing to get more access for filipino health and care workers .
but the negotiations have dragged on for months and so far , japan is only talking about allowing just 200 highly-trained applicants into the country .

however , organisations supporting overseas workers from the philippines have expressed concern over the loss of earnings caused by the new rules .
the philippines government is currently negotiating with japan to allow more of its nationals to work in other fields in japan .
between 60,000 and 80,000 filipinos arrive in japan every year on entertainment visas .
this is a euphemistic description for a process whereby most are directed by agents in both countries into japan 's extensive sex industry .
the lucky ones end up in upmarket hostess clubs and bars , where they may be well treated and earn good money .
the less fortunate find themselves working as prostitutes , subject to abuse and given no legal protection .
image problem now the japanese government is trying to clean up the country 's image after criticism by the us state department last year over its failure to control human trafficking .
it wants to cut the number of entertainment visas issued to filipinos to just 8,000 a year by imposing much stricter requirements .
from tuesday , applicants will have to provide a certificate showing they have studied some form of performance art for two years .
however , the new policy is not popular in the philippines .
groups who support overseas workers say most of those who go to japan on entertainment visas are not abused and their families rely on the earnings sent back .
they complain that it contradicts the japanese government 's promise to consider opening up to more foreign labour .
the philippines government is currently pushing to get more access for filipino health and care workers .
but the negotiations have dragged on for months and so far , japan is only talking about allowing just 200 highly-trained applicants into the country .

the london-wide print and poster campaign uses only words to engage directly with the abuser .
the advertising also warns men that they can be arrested even if a victim does not make a formal statement .
commissioner sir ian blair said abusers need to realise that men who commit domestic violence can no longer hide behind their partners ' fear .
' taking action ' he said : " we understand how distressing it is if the person you love subjects you to physical and psychological abuse , and how hard it is to report them to police .
" since the new service level agreement was signed with the crown prosecution service , we are now taking action against offenders without the support of the victim and have seen a number of successful prosecutions of this kind . "
the adverts will be put in places they least expect , such as pubs , football matches , cinemas , leisure centres , on the tube and the sports sections of metro and the evening standard .
it intentionally focuses on men who abuse women as they account for 85 % of all reported incidents and the majority of violent assaults .
strong message the campaign is supported by the mayor of london ken livingstone .
he said : " i strongly support the metropolitan police service 's new campaign to raise awareness of the criminal nature of domestic violence and to bring to account perpetrators of domestic violence . "
he said domestic violence makes up 25 % of violent crime in london and accounts for almost 1 in 5 homeless families .
a spokesperson for domestic violence charity refuge applauded the campaign saying it " sends out an strong public message that domestic violence is a crime which will no longer by ignored " .

the london-wide print and poster campaign uses only words to engage directly with the abuser .

the adverts will be put in places they least expect , such as pubs , football matches , cinemas , leisure centres , on the tube and the sports sections of metro and the evening standard .
it intentionally focuses on men who abuse women as they account for 85 % of all reported incidents and the majority of violent assaults .

union officials are claiming the settlement could mean more than 1,500 female health workers in cumbria sharing a £ 300m payout .
unison says the women could receive between £ 35,000 and £ 200,000 each , after the eight-year legal battle .
trust chief executive marie burnham said the deal would not jeopardise health care services in the county .
union officials acted on behalf of staff employed by north cumbria acute hospitals nhs trust . "
this will not be to the detriment of health care services in north cumbria " trust chief executive , marie burnham the trust has not yet put a figure on the deal - but rejects claims it could reach the £ 300m mark .
the union unison compared the pay of female staff , including nurses , domestics and telephonists , with that of male workers , including building labourers , maintenance assistants and supervisors .
some of the women are likely to receive up to 14 years difference in pay .
equal value claims were lodged in august 1997 for 14 different working categories .
unison general secretary dave prentis said : " it 's been a long , hard struggle , but this is a fantastic result for the members involved .
' local problem ' " we have always argued that there has been historic pay discrimination in the health service against women .
it 's dreadful , though , that it has taken so long to get justice for these hard-working women who are the backbone of the nhs . "
the trust runs two hospitals , the cumberland infirmary and the west cumberland hospital .
marie burnham , trust chief executive , added : " at this stage it is very difficult to calculate what people will get .
what i can say is that the settlement will not be anywhere near £ 300m .
" this is a local problem for cumbria and we will have to find a lot of money to pay this bill .
' sensible manner ' " but this will not be to the detriment of health care services in north cumbria .
" we have been working with department of health and the strategic health authority who have assured me that service will not be jeopardised as a result of this .
" we are pleased that a proposed agreement has been reached and i trust that this long-standing issue will soon be resolved in a sensible manner . "
about 100 members have retired since the case began and they will be paid compensation as well as receiving better pensions .
details of the settlement will be put to staff at a meeting in carlisle next week .

union officials are claiming the settlement could mean more than 1,500 female health workers in cumbria sharing a £ 300m payout .
unison says the women could receive between £ 35,000 and £ 200,000 each , after the eight-year legal battle .
trust chief executive marie burnham said the deal would not jeopardise health care services in the county .
union officials acted on behalf of staff employed by north cumbria acute hospitals nhs trust .
this will not be to the detriment of health care services in north cumbria trust chief executive , marie burnham the trust has not yet put a figure on the deal - but rejects claims it could reach the £ 300m mark .
the union unison compared the pay of female staff , including nurses , domestics and telephonists , with that of male workers , including building labourers , maintenance assistants and supervisors .
some of the women are likely to receive up to 14 years difference in pay .
equal value claims were lodged in august 1997 for 14 different working categories .
unison general secretary dave prentis said : " it 's been a long , hard struggle , but this is a fantastic result for the members involved .
' local problem ' " we have always argued that there has been historic pay discrimination in the health service against women .
it 's dreadful , though , that it has taken so long to get justice for these hard-working women who are the backbone of the nhs . "
the trust runs two hospitals , the cumberland infirmary and the west cumberland hospital .
marie burnham , trust chief executive , added : " at this stage it is very difficult to calculate what people will get .
what i can say is that the settlement will not be anywhere near £ 300m .
" this is a local problem for cumbria and we will have to find a lot of money to pay this bill .
' sensible manner ' " but this will not be to the detriment of health care services in north cumbria .
" we have been working with department of health and the strategic health authority who have assured me that service will not be jeopardised as a result of this .
" we are pleased that a proposed agreement has been reached and i trust that this long-standing issue will soon be resolved in a sensible manner . "
about 100 members have retired since the case began and they will be paid compensation as well as receiving better pensions .
details of the settlement will be put to staff at a meeting in carlisle next week .

it envisages new roles for hospitals , better care for patients in their communities and measures to improve health as well as treating sickness .
organisations representing patients , doctors , local health boards and nhs trusts compiled the document , called a picture of health .
the welsh assembly government described it as " a helpful contribution " .
leaders at the nhs confederation , the british medical association , royal college of nursing and community health councils in wales , have been meeting since last july to create the report .
we have lots of health policy in wales but it needs to be brought together in one picture mike ponton , director of the welsh nhs confederation the report suggests that , with changes , no-one in wales will have waited more than three months from referral to operation by 2015 .
its authors say the ideas would improve access to treatment and build on good practice already being developed at a local level , such as delivering chemotherapy at home or mobile treatment units in city centres .
mike ponton , director of the welsh nhs confederation , said the report represented " what we know needs to be done to improve the nhs and make sure we provide the sorts of service people will expect in 2015 " .
" we have lots of health policy in wales but it needs to be brought together in one picture so we can think about how we can move forward and achieve that , " he said .
it was also important for people to look after their own health , he added .
ten-year strategy in 2003 , a report compiled on behalf of the welsh assembly said the nhs must modernise or face being overwhelmed .
the study by health services expert derek wanless warned that the service was not sustainable .
over the last few months , research has found that some senior nhs staff lack confidence in the service and an nhs trust chief executive claimed it was not managing to solve its problems .
a spokeswoman for the welsh assembly government reacted to tuesday 's report , by saying it was good to see a partnership approach behind the document .
" this is a helpful contribution to the discussions on how to develop a health and social care service that is fit for the 21st century , " she said .
" the discussions we have had with the partners who have produced this document have helped to inform the assembly in the development of its 10-year strategy which is to be launched next month . "

tickets for saturday 's match in cardiff are changing hands on internet action sites for up to £ 250 each .
although the wru has urged people not to buy tickets from touts , it said sellers were not breaking the law .
but officials said fans who are without a ticket should either stay home or watch the match at the pub .
it is illegal to re-sell tickets for football games due to crowd trouble fears but the same rule does not apply to rugby .
i am sure there are hundreds of welsh supporters being denied the opportunity to watch wales play rugby fan kevin jones saturday 's showdown at the millennium stadium has been a sell-out for weeks with official ticket prices ranging from £ 14 to £ 42 .
but scores of tickets can be bought on internet auction sites at hugely inflated prices .
one ticket has even been advertised on one site at £ 2,000 .
rugby fan kevin jones from laugharne in carmarthenshire said : " how do these people , who are not true supporters of their country , get the chance to have tickets when they have no intention of going .
" the people selling the tickets are only out to make a profit .
" i am sure there are hundreds of welsh supporters being denied the opportunity to watch wales play . "
paul sergeant warns fans buying from touts will be disappointed the welsh rugby union said it clearly stated on each ticket that they are not to be re-sold above face value .
a spokeswoman said : " it is against the rules to sell tickets above face value without our consent however it is not an illegal practice in law . "
she said that , where possible , the wru would attempt to trace the source of tickets on the black market and would take action against those found selling tickets at a profit .
" we will be reviewing the situation after the six nations , " she added .
" we would urge people not to pay over face value for tickets .
" there were people who left the game against in england in tears because they had bought tickets that were stolen and had to leave . "
stadium manager paul sergeant also warned against buying tickets from touts or over the web .
" you 're going to get your fingers burnt , " he said .
" you run every risk of buying tickets that are either forged or stolen .
" my advice is if you have n't got a ticket either stay at home or go and watch it in the pub . "

they are included in a report , released by the welsh assembly government , to look at improvements at the rush-hour bottle-neck .
they are seen as short-term solutions before work on a planned £ 350m m4 relief road starts .
the 50mph limit is suggested for the m4 between junctions 24 and 28 , coldra and tredegar park .
the study 's authors believes that it could help improve traffic flows , reduce serious accidents due to sharp-braking , as well as bring some improvements in air quality for residents living nearby .

it would need to involve a further feasibility study , says the report .
more radical ideas rejected included using hard shoulders for buses and closing junction 26 eastbound at malpas and junction 25 at caerleon .
plans for a 14-mile relief road between magor and castleton - which is likely to be a toll motorway - were announced in late 2004 .
but work would not start for five or six years and business leaders in south wales have already expressed concern at the economic impact of congestion , around the brynglas tunnels at newport .
the relief road , between junctions 23 and 29 , is expected to cost at least £ 350m and is likely to be tolled , but faces opposition from environmental groups .
economic transport minister andrew davies said in december that work on the road , through the former llanwern steelmaking site , could start in the next five years .
it is part of the assembly government 's 15-year transport plan .

a park-and-ride scheme and an uphill hard shoulder lane are other measures suggested by consultants .
they are included in a report , released by the welsh assembly government , to look at improvements at the rush-hour bottle-neck .
they are seen as short-term solutions before work on a planned £ 350m m4 relief road starts .
the 50mph limit is suggested for the m4 between junctions 24 and 28 , coldra and tredegar park .
the study 's authors believes that it could help improve traffic flows , reduce serious accidents due to sharp-braking , as well as bring some improvements in air quality for residents living nearby .
improved lighting , chevron road markings to encourage cars to keep their distance are also being suggested .
the making better use study by capita symonds was commissioned in 2002 for the assembly government .
m4 improvement ideas 50mph speed limit , junctions 24-28 better lighting , junctions 29-34 park and ride improvements at high cross junction hard shoulder climbing lane , jct 32 westbound the park-and-ride scheme , which would be the most costly of the measures , would involve providing express buses between strategic points along the m4 and also into newport and cardiff .
it would need to involve a further feasibility study , says the report .
more radical ideas rejected included using hard shoulders for buses and closing junction 26 eastbound at malpas and junction 25 at caerleon .
plans for a 14-mile relief road between magor and castleton - which is likely to be a toll motorway - were announced in late 2004 .
but work would not start for five or six years and business leaders in south wales have already expressed concern at the economic impact of congestion , around the brynglas tunnels at newport .
the relief road , between junctions 23 and 29 , is expected to cost at least £ 350m and is likely to be tolled , but faces opposition from environmental groups .
economic transport minister andrew davies said in december that work on the road , through the former llanwern steelmaking site , could start in the next five years .
it is part of the assembly government 's 15-year transport plan .

british medical association chairman james johnson said taking much-needed staff is morally indefensible .
the bma says african nations in particular are being damaged .
the government 's tougher code to prevent the active recruitment of such workers does not stop those who volunteer to come to the uk , it says . "
african governments have neglected doctors .
i salute the west for recognising that health comes first " kisanya vincent , nairobi , kenya send your comments last year two thirds of newly-registered doctors , and more than 40 % of nurses , came from abroad .
about 12,500 doctors currently registered to work in britain are from african nations that face serious staff shortages themselves , said the bbc 's mike thompson .
and , over the last six years , nearly 16,000 african nurses have registered to work in the uk .
aids deaths in zambia only 50 out of 600 doctors trained since independence are still practising in the country .
three-quarters of zimbabwe 's doctors have left since the early 1990s . "
there is literally , in some parts of these countries , no healthcare of any sort " james johnson bma ' i came to the uk to nurse ' more than half of all ghana 's doctors have left the country and a quarter of malawi 's remaining health workers are expected to die from aids within five years .
in uganda there are only 10 nurses for every 100,000 people - 10 times less than in the uk .
the government recently introduced a tougher code of practice to stop the active recruitment of the developing world 's health workers .
but the bma says this move does not stop those who volunteer to come to britain in search of better salaries and conditions .
according to new figures obtained by the bbc , it costs african nations £ 270m to train the doctors and nurses who have migrated to britain , said our correspondent .
the same statistics also show that britain , where training is much more expensive , has saved 10 times that by not having to school them itself .
this is what the bma insists can not be justified .
james johnson , bma chairman , said : " if you go to a country like ghana , which has a population of about a third of ours , they have 1,500 doctors in the whole country .
" it is just astonishing .
there is literally , in some parts of these countries , no healthcare of any sort . "
mr johnson said it was vital the government committed itself to becoming self-sufficient in doctors and nurses within the next decade .
" if one considers the absolutely catastrophic effect that the current polices are having on the developing world , it seems quite immoral to consider any other course of action . "
government response the department of health said that over the last five years britain had donated £ 560m towards healthcare in africa .
a spokesman said : " the nhs does not actively recruit from any country that does not wish to be recruited from .
" the nhs leads the way in the ethical recruitment of healthcare professionals with a strict list of countries from which it does not actively recruit , drawn up with the agreement of the countries involved , which includes much of africa .
" however , if healthcare professionals are determined to come here to work we can not legally deny them that opportunity . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " we have committed ourselves to training more doctors .
" it is not sustainable for britain to drain developing countries of doctors and nurses vital to the development of their own health services . "
liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said : " the nhs has been far too dependent for far too long on overseas recruitment .
" despite the protestations of ministers that we have the most ethical policy in the world , that policy is neither monitored nor enforced . " systems of essential staff . "
tom hadley , of the recruitment and employment confederation , said the issue was complex .
" restricting international opportunities for healthcare workers could make the profession less attractive to those in developing countries which could lead to skills shortages .
" in addition , the vast majority of those who come to work in the uk from developing countries currently return to their country of origin after a few months or years , often with vastly improved skills and levels of experience .
" the concern is that if seeking employment in the uk is made more difficult , they will simply go to other countries , such as australia and the us , where the process of finding work is not hampered . "
here are a selection of your views the ethics of governmental finances and politics leave me cold at the utter callous indifference to populations and infrastructures in the developing world ; arms for profit , aid to corrupt dictatorships , plundering of human resources .
the public health consequences of survivalist migrations , compounded by irresponsible individual practices , will lead directly to the exploitative nations reaping the aftermath of their short-sighted greed .
dr wassim malas , manchester - united kingdom the problem lies with the countries where these doctors originate , not the opportunities awaiting them elsewhere .
it is naïve to believe that the domestic situation of their countries of origin does not affect their intent to migrate . "
by sorting out the real problems in countries like zimbabwe you may find doctors willing to stay there . "
glenn lewis , amsterdam , netherlands under apartheid , south africa experienced a brain drain too .
the solution to reduce this outflow was to end apartheid , not prevent the emigrants from leaving by blocking their entry to other countries .
by sorting out the real problems in countries like zimbabwe you may find doctors willing to stay there .
these always reflect back to their leadership .
glenn lewis , amsterdam , netherlands it is scandalous that we take doctors and other medical staff from third world countries , instead of training our own .
at the age of 29 , having worked overseas , and saved most of my earnings , i applied for a university place to study medicine .
as i was financially secure , and able to pay for the course , i offered to do so .
the powers that be , however informed me , that i was too old to start a medical course .
with this sort of attitude , it is no wonder we are short of ' home grown ' doctors .
paul m , huddersfield the head of the british medical association is effectively complaining that people living in poverty take the difficult decision to leave behind their relatives and friends to go search for better working conditions and salaries that would guarantee a better future for their dependents .
members of the bma would definitely do the same if they ever lived in the poverty experienced by african doctors and nurses .
it would be good if those righteous took the time to consider that those doctors and nurses are human beings , some with families , who would gladly stay with old friends and relatives in africa if only they could earn what counterparts in europe earn .
piu neville , dar es salaam , tanzania those health care workers that can , will consider to move to where they can work and live under easier circumstances .
we do n't really see australians or britons or french or germans etc , leaving their countries in hordes ?
it is due to " pushing factors " rather than " pulling " that cause people to leave in masses .
i have gone both ways and the decision is never easy .
africa needs to start using the billions in aid money received n a constructive way .
dirk von delft , cape town , south africa -lrb- again -rrb- if you work in a country where the government would hold your salary for months then you would understand why the doctors have to leave , the reason is simple the government in most african countries are irresponsible to the needs of the people .
andy esun , warri , nigeria african governments need to value us doctors .
i have doctor friends working in ghana and when you start working after medical school you could work for over 4 to 6 months before you are paid .
also you do n't officially have a single day off .
doctors are badly paid in general .
also , if you training outside and go back home , they make it very difficult for you to stay .
i have heard of consultants from the us who wanted to go back to ghana but they were treated in such a way they had to leave ghana .
africa can gain from the training doctors receive if the health system opens up to receive us .
until then , i 'm afraid people like myself will sadly remain in the uk .
james , reading .
uk would it be better if medical personnel from so called " developing " countries were forced to work for a government that refuses to pay their salaries for several months , equip the hospitals and promote research ? "
medical personnel are human too , they have a right to the basic needs of life which they are currently being denied in the so called ' developing ' countries " oyin oyatoye , nigeria what quality of health care would be obtainable in a system like this ?
the solution is to ensure good governance in these countries .
medical personnel are human too , they have a right to the basic needs of life which they are currently being denied in the so called " developing " countries .
oyin oyatoye , nigeria to blame the problems of africa 's health crisis on the nhs is ludicrous .
the issue is simple , after studying for many years african doctors take the economic decision to work in the west where health standards , facilities and quality of living are far higher than anything africa can offer .
of course there a small minority of african doctors who genuinely want to help their fellow people however it is the responsibility of african governments to improve levels of healthcare and doctors ' welfare .
farooq , manchester , uk this is deja vu for many of us who grew up in africa and we were strongly committed to stay and help develop our various countries .
having lectured in my home country , sierra leone for several years the situation became untenable .
salaries , working conditions , political thuggery and the manipulation of the constitution drove many of us out of the country .
for those of our friends and relatives that stayed at home , 11 years civil war compounded their problems .
i know a good number of people in my situation who are quite willing to go back and help provided , the level of corruption and mismanagement can be reduced .
it seems that the brain drain has a direct co-relation to the level of corruption and on under development that prevails in a country .
one only needs to look at certain countries in west africa .
professor kingsley banya , miami florida usa this situation is ridiculous .
i know of so many friends who desperately tried to get onto medicine courses with 3 a 's at a-level but got turned down due to lack of course places .
there are quite clearly enough people in this country who want to be doctors yet the government fails to create more courses .
it 's then so insulting to those who 've worked their socks off at a-level to see foreign doctors being imported .
if more courses were made available then more doctors would be trained , thus solving the shortage problems .
i ca n't see why the government has n't got this sorted , it 's not exactly rocket science is it ?
anon , reading , uk why are we pushing the blame on the west ?
neither uk nor us or canada is responsible for the migration of doctors from africa .
every human being regardless of race , tribe or ethnicity need the same basic necessities for life ; food , security and decent shelter to live .
all these are lacking in africa except for the politicians .
thus ask the leaders who have failed their people .
afterwards brain-drain is far more better than brain-wastage .
i 'm african living in the us and i 'm in the health field , yet i have no intention to go africa and work .
i will go there to do some volunteer work to help my people if need be but not to stay there to work .
who will pay me ?

according to new figures obtained by the bbc , it costs african nations £ 270m to train the doctors and nurses who have migrated to britain , said our correspondent .
the same statistics also show that britain , where training is much more expensive , has saved 10 times that by not having to school them itself .
this is what the bma insists can not be justified .
james johnson , bma chairman , said : " if you go to a country like ghana , which has a population of about a third of ours , they have 1,500 doctors in the whole country .
" it is just astonishing .
there is literally , in some parts of these countries , no healthcare of any sort . "
mr johnson said it was vital the government committed itself to becoming self-sufficient in doctors and nurses within the next decade .
" if one considers the absolutely catastrophic effect that the current polices are having on the developing world , it seems quite immoral to consider any other course of action . "
government response the department of health said that over the last five years britain had donated £ 560m towards healthcare in africa .
a spokesman said : " the nhs does not actively recruit from any country that does not wish to be recruited from .
" the nhs leads the way in the ethical recruitment of healthcare professionals with a strict list of countries from which it does not actively recruit , drawn up with the agreement of the countries involved , which includes much of africa .
" however , if healthcare professionals are determined to come here to work we can not legally deny them that opportunity . "
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " we have committed ourselves to training more doctors .
" it is not sustainable for britain to drain developing countries of doctors and nurses vital to the development of their own health services . "
liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said : " the nhs has been far too dependent for far too long on overseas recruitment .
" despite the protestations of ministers that we have the most ethical policy in the world , that policy is neither monitored nor enforced . " systems of essential staff . "
tom hadley , of the recruitment and employment confederation , said the issue was complex .
" restricting international opportunities for healthcare workers could make the profession less attractive to those in developing countries which could lead to skills shortages .
" in addition , the vast majority of those who come to work in the uk from developing countries currently return to their country of origin after a few months or years , often with vastly improved skills and levels of experience .
" the concern is that if seeking employment in the uk is made more difficult , they will simply go to other countries , such as australia and the us , where the process of finding work is not hampered . "
here are a selection of your views the ethics of governmental finances and politics leave me cold at the utter callous indifference to populations and infrastructures in the developing world ; arms for profit , aid to corrupt dictatorships , plundering of human resources .
the public health consequences of survivalist migrations , compounded by irresponsible individual practices , will lead directly to the exploitative nations reaping the aftermath of their short-sighted greed .

professor kingsley banya , miami florida usa this situation is ridiculous .
i know of so many friends who desperately tried to get onto medicine courses with 3 a 's at a-level but got turned down due to lack of course places .
there are quite clearly enough people in this country who want to be doctors yet the government fails to create more courses .
it 's then so insulting to those who 've worked their socks off at a-level to see foreign doctors being imported .
if more courses were made available then more doctors would be trained , thus solving the shortage problems .
i ca n't see why the government has n't got this sorted , it 's not exactly rocket science is it ?
anon , reading , uk why are we pushing the blame on the west ?
neither uk nor us or canada is responsible for the migration of doctors from africa .
every human being regardless of race , tribe or ethnicity need the same basic necessities for life ; food , security and decent shelter to live .
all these are lacking in africa except for the politicians .
thus ask the leaders who have failed their people .
afterwards brain-drain is far more better than brain-wastage .
i 'm african living in the us and i 'm in the health field , yet i have no intention to go africa and work .
i will go there to do some volunteer work to help my people if need be but not to stay there to work .
who will pay me ?

i know of so many friends who desperately tried to get onto medicine courses with 3 a 's at a-level but got turned down due to lack of course places .
there are quite clearly enough people in this country who want to be doctors yet the government fails to create more courses .
it 's then so insulting to those who 've worked their socks off at a-level to see foreign doctors being imported .
if more courses were made available then more doctors would be trained , thus solving the shortage problems .
i ca n't see why the government has n't got this sorted , it 's not exactly rocket science is it ?
anon , reading , uk why are we pushing the blame on the west ?
neither uk nor us or canada is responsible for the migration of doctors from africa .
every human being regardless of race , tribe or ethnicity need the same basic necessities for life ; food , security and decent shelter to live .
all these are lacking in africa except for the politicians .
thus ask the leaders who have failed their people .
afterwards brain-drain is far more better than brain-wastage .
i 'm african living in the us and i 'm in the health field , yet i have no intention to go africa and work .
i will go there to do some volunteer work to help my people if need be but not to stay there to work .
who will pay me ?
