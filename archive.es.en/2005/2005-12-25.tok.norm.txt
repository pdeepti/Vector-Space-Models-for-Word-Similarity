twinkling lights and bright ornaments are the traditional dress for a christmas tree .

he 's forced to defend himself because of his tree 's bad manners . " well , we did n't know it at first , but the tree seems to enjoy jostling people 's feet , " said stefan .
" it 's obviously looking for some company . " sig n posts a n d torture pictures creative assistant stefan legner had an idea for the " hottest " exhibit in the hall : a christmas tree made from green chili peppers .

in the background , a patriotic speech by us president george w. bush loops infinitely . umbrellas a n d toilet paper good ideas are the key to the christmas tree show .
sandra and moritz , who both study product design , organized this year 's exhibition .

moritz is delighted when he sees so much creativity . " it 's actually quite typical : just look at what somebody from the administration has created , " said moritz .
" you 'd think it was a student .

26 , 2004 .
so he decided to skip christmas at home in munich and to make the journey to thailand along with his other son , rolf , in the hopes of making peace with the tragedy that until now had seemed impossibly vague and distant . " this is important for my own understanding , looking at the sites , to understand what happened , " rolf bischof said . " we did n't know what to expect , " said his father .
" but now we have the feeling , especially after visiting the temple yesterday , that the circle is complete . " the remains of his son , also named christian , were identified in mid-february .
his partner 's body was identified a few weeks later , and the two were buried together on april 28 .
the remains were cremated at wat phratong before being repatriated .
the elder bischof said he had feared that the crematorium was an impersonal company .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a japanese man offers prayers as buddhist monks chant during a memorial service at kamala beach , in phuket on sunday " but the temple is a place full of dignity , " he said . the two men were among hundreds of european tsunami victims who left behind snow and christmas trees for a sometimes painful trip to see the thai beaches where their loved died one year ago .
" never-ending hope " the bischofs came with about 70 people on a trip organized by the german red cross , through a project called " never-ending hope , " which brought families as well as specialists to provide psychological support during the trip .
funded through donations , many from individual germans , the group organized a private christmas eve service as well as a german-language memorial for about 150 germans , austrians and swiss on the beach in khao lak on dec .

" a lot of people asked why they did n't run faster " when the tsunami came , christian bischof said .
" now we are very sure that there was no possibility of escaping from the waves .
all the families wanted to come to search for their relatives , but now we know that it would have been impossible to look for the missing on our own . " klaus gatzke , from the northern german state of schleswig-holstein , lost his 22-year-old son florian in the tsunami .
florian and his girlfriend were separated when the waves crashed onto land , but she survived , gatzke said .
florian 's body was n't identified until march 26 , and the funeral was only held on april 22 , dragging out the grieving process , he said . " this was the best way we could do it , going with a group of other relatives and with a group of specialists to help us with the mourning , " gatzke said . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the asian tsunami : one year after a selection of dw-world articles about the indian ocean tsunami .

twinkling lights and bright ornaments are the traditional dress for a christmas tree .
but some young german designers want to prove that flashy , ugly , spicy is the way to go , as they showed at an exhibition in karlsruhe . the atrium of the karlsruhe university of design smells like mulled wine .
after all , it 's hosting an exhibit on christmas trees : all bear a sign with their name and deal with the topic of the christmas tree in very different ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " super action " tree loves to attack visitors one of the most striking pieces is a plastic fir tree that can be operated by remote control .
it swirls around the hall on massive tires .
the tree is jostling visitors and other exhibits . stefan , who created the " super action christmas tree , " is controlling his invention from the stairway .
he 's forced to defend himself because of his tree 's bad manners . " well , we did n't know it at first , but the tree seems to enjoy jostling people 's feet , " said stefan .
" it 's obviously looking for some company . " sig n posts a n d torture pictures creative assistant stefan legner had an idea for the " hottest " exhibit in the hall : a christmas tree made from green chili peppers .
the sign next to it reads " darling , the tree is on fire . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas produces a lot of garbage , as this tree shows there 's plenty in the exhibition to keep visitors amused : there 's a tree made from green beer bottles or the " sign post forest , " a tree constructed out of three triangular right-of-way road signs on top of one another . but there are also some very serious exhibits . the only real living-room-like christmas tree in the entire atrium is decorated with electric lights and reveals its true identity only upon second glance . the ornaments are photos from the abu ghraib prison in iraq , showing american soldiers abusing prisoners .
in the background , a patriotic speech by us president george w. bush loops infinitely . umbrellas a n d toilet paper good ideas are the key to the christmas tree show .
sandra and moritz , who both study product design , organized this year 's exhibition .
last year , only students and professors took part in it .
but this time , other university employees were asked to create an exhibit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree portrays the traditional headdress of the black forest many of them did .
the three janitors , for instance , made a tree from toilet paper . students and visitors alike are particularly impressed by the work of a staff member from administration .
she took the metal frame of an umbrella , sprayed it gold , and bent it so that it took the shape of a christmas tree .
moritz is delighted when he sees so much creativity . " it 's actually quite typical : just look at what somebody from the administration has created , " said moritz .
" you 'd think it was a student .
and then you think : hey , why do n't these people study here ? " art with calories as the evening progresses , two christmas trees are gaining increasing popularity : one that can be drunk and another one that can be eaten .
the tree made from full beer bottles seems to appear at the right time , as the organizers have run out of beer . in no time , the artists have also eaten up the multilayered christmas tree made from cake . " this tree actually reflects my understanding of christmas pretty nicely , " martin said .
" when i was a child , christmas always meant eating loads of great food .

twinkling lights and bright ornaments are the traditional dress for a christmas tree .
but some young german designers want to prove that flashy , ugly , spicy is the way to go , as they showed at an exhibition in karlsruhe . the atrium of the karlsruhe university of design smells like mulled wine .
after all , it 's hosting an exhibit on christmas trees : all bear a sign with their name and deal with the topic of the christmas tree in very different ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " super action " tree loves to attack visitors one of the most striking pieces is a plastic fir tree that can be operated by remote control .
it swirls around the hall on massive tires .
the tree is jostling visitors and other exhibits . stefan , who created the " super action christmas tree , " is controlling his invention from the stairway .
he 's forced to defend himself because of his tree 's bad manners . " well , we did n't know it at first , but the tree seems to enjoy jostling people 's feet , " said stefan .
" it 's obviously looking for some company . " sig n posts a n d torture pictures creative assistant stefan legner had an idea for the " hottest " exhibit in the hall : a christmas tree made from green chili peppers .
the sign next to it reads " darling , the tree is on fire . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas produces a lot of garbage , as this tree shows there 's plenty in the exhibition to keep visitors amused : there 's a tree made from green beer bottles or the " sign post forest , " a tree constructed out of three triangular right-of-way road signs on top of one another . but there are also some very serious exhibits . the only real living-room-like christmas tree in the entire atrium is decorated with electric lights and reveals its true identity only upon second glance . the ornaments are photos from the abu ghraib prison in iraq , showing american soldiers abusing prisoners .
in the background , a patriotic speech by us president george w. bush loops infinitely . umbrellas a n d toilet paper good ideas are the key to the christmas tree show .
sandra and moritz , who both study product design , organized this year 's exhibition .
last year , only students and professors took part in it .
but this time , other university employees were asked to create an exhibit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree portrays the traditional headdress of the black forest many of them did .
the three janitors , for instance , made a tree from toilet paper . students and visitors alike are particularly impressed by the work of a staff member from administration .
she took the metal frame of an umbrella , sprayed it gold , and bent it so that it took the shape of a christmas tree .
moritz is delighted when he sees so much creativity . " it 's actually quite typical : just look at what somebody from the administration has created , " said moritz .
" you 'd think it was a student .
and then you think : hey , why do n't these people study here ? " art with calories as the evening progresses , two christmas trees are gaining increasing popularity : one that can be drunk and another one that can be eaten .
the tree made from full beer bottles seems to appear at the right time , as the organizers have run out of beer . in no time , the artists have also eaten up the multilayered christmas tree made from cake . " this tree actually reflects my understanding of christmas pretty nicely , " martin said .

in 1588 , queen elizabeth i of england ordered everyone to have roast goose for their christmas meal because it was the what she had been doing when news of the english victory over the spanish armada reached her .
goose then became the traditional christmas dish in england and spread from there to germany . but there 's more to the christmas goose tradition than just that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.12.2005 opinion : muslim involvement can help media perceptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more muslims get involved in the media , the more balanced representation will be when islam is covered in the german media , discussion frequently mixes political , social and religious issues .
debate on islamic topics can only gain in sophistication when more muslims are involved in producing content . german journalism has developed more sensibility and increased the knowledge about islam and muslim culture , some experts say . in late october , the evening broadcast on channel 3 , a public television station , featured the talk show " nachtcafé . "
it chose the " fear of islam " as its theme .
the invited guests were to discuss a number of very complex issues : terrorism , the potential for reform in islam , forced marriages , the headscarf , honor killing , and radical tendencies among young muslims in germany .
this combination of social , political , and religious topics under the label of islam has been increasingly apparent in the german media for a number of years , according to claudia dantschke , a freelance journalist in berlin .
" in germany we see an extremely homogenized discussion , " she said .
" in the past , this was accompanied by ethnic connotations .
this translated as an ' us ' - ethnic germans - versus ethnic turks , arabs , and so on .
the language has changed since sept .
11 . " now the debate is not one of ethnicity , but of culture , " dantschke added .
" this means that ' muslim ' currently stands as a synonym for what used to be referred to as ' arab ' or ' turk . '
this societal discussion is reflected in the media .
and the media does n't exist in a vacuum outside of society . "
of course , topics such as honor killing or the situation of young people from migrant families should be discussed in public .
the religious aspect , however , is only one among many and should not be misrepresented as providing the public with a deeper understanding of any particular issue or of being yet another underlying cause of certain problems .
devout or fa n atical ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western journalists struggle to understand some religious forms of expression the generalizing manner in which the german media covers adherents of a world religion like islam is also a sign of difficulties within society .
many journalists in an overwhelmingly secular society find it difficult to deal with religious forms of expression .
how should they describe someone who prays five times a day or a woman who wears a headscarf ?
are they simply devout or already fanatics ?
yet , there is also something positive to report about the situation in the german media .
in recent years , islam and its rituals have managed to be covered regularly , even in the local press .
reports on the fast month of ramadan , on religious festivities , or on the " open-door " day at mosques appear regularly .
both muslim and non-muslim media observers have confirmed the increasing competency of german journalists in handling islamic topics .
" it is getting better to the extent that most journalists who used to approach us knew next to nothing about islam , " said ayman mazyek , editor in chief of the web site islam.de.
" they lacked even a basic knowledge of islam .
things have improved .
reporters writing about islam have developed a higher journalistic ethos . "
actors i n the media la n dscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers like the " islamische zeitung " in germany act as a bridge between cultures in addition , muslims in germany are no longer merely the objects of reporting in the german press , but have since become actors in the country 's media landscape .
one example is the newspaper islamische zeitu n g , established in 1996 .
it is published every three weeks with a circulation of 10,000 copies .
it aims to promote communication between muslims and serve as a bridge between islam and europe .
another example is the internet portal " islam.de , " which began in 1996 as an information forum of the central committee of muslims in germany .
today , the portal claims to provide critical and constructive reporting on islam and muslims , while contributing to a better understanding of islam .
ayman mazyek , however , has no illusions about the role played by the muslim media in germany : " in relation to the mass media , the few sprouts of muslim media here in germany are truly miniscule , " he said .
" they could , perhaps , enjoy a disproportionate influence in that it is currently difficult to report on islam or make a claim without also providing an account of what muslims themselves think on the issue .
it used to be the case – because we did n't have our own media institutions or the internet – that claims were simply published as is .
" now , at least , when reporters conduct their research , muslims can be found to have positions on any number of issues , " mazyek added .
" the result is that many disseminators of information in the media turn to authentic muslim web sites or newspapers to find out what muslims are saying and thinking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second and third generation muslim migrants have a unique view of life in germany a n i n depe n de n t islamic media ? yet one of the big problems is the question of loyalty in the media .
is islam.de truly independent or does it remain a mouthpiece for the central committee of muslims ?
is the controversial sheikh abdalqadir behind the islamische zeitung , as cologne journalist ahmet senyurt claims ?
both islam.de and the islamische zeitu n g have denied the charges . it 's remarkable , nonetheless , that so many young freelance journalists work in the muslim media .
it 's evident that second and third generation migrants want to have access to german society and engage in discussion .
it 's high time for german mass media to provide broader access to this social group by welcoming muslim journalists into their fold . mona naggar , qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german media under fire from muslims the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important .
-lrb- july 20 , 2005 -rrb- interfaith thinkers debate integration scientists , politicians and religious leaders met at a conference in berlin to discuss the issues of muslims living in western societies , stressing that better integration would be pivotal in curbing islamic extremism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.12.2005 opinion : muslim involvement can help media perceptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more muslims get involved in the media , the more balanced representation will be when islam is covered in the german media , discussion frequently mixes political , social and religious issues .
debate on islamic topics can only gain in sophistication when more muslims are involved in producing content . german journalism has developed more sensibility and increased the knowledge about islam and muslim culture , some experts say . in late october , the evening broadcast on channel 3 , a public television station , featured the talk show " nachtcafé . "
it chose the " fear of islam " as its theme .
the invited guests were to discuss a number of very complex issues : terrorism , the potential for reform in islam , forced marriages , the headscarf , honor killing , and radical tendencies among young muslims in germany .
this combination of social , political , and religious topics under the label of islam has been increasingly apparent in the german media for a number of years , according to claudia dantschke , a freelance journalist in berlin .
" in germany we see an extremely homogenized discussion , " she said .
" in the past , this was accompanied by ethnic connotations .
this translated as an ' us ' - ethnic germans - versus ethnic turks , arabs , and so on .
the language has changed since sept .
11 . " now the debate is not one of ethnicity , but of culture , " dantschke added .
" this means that ' muslim ' currently stands as a synonym for what used to be referred to as ' arab ' or ' turk . '
this societal discussion is reflected in the media .
and the media does n't exist in a vacuum outside of society . "
of course , topics such as honor killing or the situation of young people from migrant families should be discussed in public .
the religious aspect , however , is only one among many and should not be misrepresented as providing the public with a deeper understanding of any particular issue or of being yet another underlying cause of certain problems .
devout or fa n atical ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western journalists struggle to understand some religious forms of expression the generalizing manner in which the german media covers adherents of a world religion like islam is also a sign of difficulties within society .
many journalists in an overwhelmingly secular society find it difficult to deal with religious forms of expression .
how should they describe someone who prays five times a day or a woman who wears a headscarf ?
are they simply devout or already fanatics ?
yet , there is also something positive to report about the situation in the german media .
in recent years , islam and its rituals have managed to be covered regularly , even in the local press .
reports on the fast month of ramadan , on religious festivities , or on the " open-door " day at mosques appear regularly .
both muslim and non-muslim media observers have confirmed the increasing competency of german journalists in handling islamic topics .
" it is getting better to the extent that most journalists who used to approach us knew next to nothing about islam , " said ayman mazyek , editor in chief of the web site islam.de.
" they lacked even a basic knowledge of islam .
things have improved .
reporters writing about islam have developed a higher journalistic ethos . "
actors i n the media la n dscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers like the " islamische zeitung " in germany act as a bridge between cultures in addition , muslims in germany are no longer merely the objects of reporting in the german press , but have since become actors in the country 's media landscape .
one example is the newspaper islamische zeitu n g , established in 1996 .
it is published every three weeks with a circulation of 10,000 copies .
it aims to promote communication between muslims and serve as a bridge between islam and europe .
another example is the internet portal " islam.de , " which began in 1996 as an information forum of the central committee of muslims in germany .
today , the portal claims to provide critical and constructive reporting on islam and muslims , while contributing to a better understanding of islam .
ayman mazyek , however , has no illusions about the role played by the muslim media in germany : " in relation to the mass media , the few sprouts of muslim media here in germany are truly miniscule , " he said .
" they could , perhaps , enjoy a disproportionate influence in that it is currently difficult to report on islam or make a claim without also providing an account of what muslims themselves think on the issue .
it used to be the case – because we did n't have our own media institutions or the internet – that claims were simply published as is .
" now , at least , when reporters conduct their research , muslims can be found to have positions on any number of issues , " mazyek added .
" the result is that many disseminators of information in the media turn to authentic muslim web sites or newspapers to find out what muslims are saying and thinking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second and third generation muslim migrants have a unique view of life in germany a n i n depe n de n t islamic media ? yet one of the big problems is the question of loyalty in the media .
is islam.de truly independent or does it remain a mouthpiece for the central committee of muslims ?
is the controversial sheikh abdalqadir behind the islamische zeitung , as cologne journalist ahmet senyurt claims ?
both islam.de and the islamische zeitu n g have denied the charges . it 's remarkable , nonetheless , that so many young freelance journalists work in the muslim media .
it 's evident that second and third generation migrants want to have access to german society and engage in discussion .
it 's high time for german mass media to provide broader access to this social group by welcoming muslim journalists into their fold . mona naggar , qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german media under fire from muslims the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .

even so , germany still has to import them from poland and hungary .
siegrid höltel , who runs a farms that raises geese near cologne , does n't put great stock in fattening up geese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to fears of bird flu , geese had to remain in their stalls this year " geese that have only been kept in their stalls and fattened up are really something different than geese that are allowed to graze in fields all summer long .
they 're more tender and lean . " the tradition of roast goose at christmas is centuries ' old .
in 1588 , queen elizabeth i of england ordered everyone to have roast goose for their christmas meal because it was the what she had been doing when news of the english victory over the spanish armada reached her .
goose then became the traditional christmas dish in england and spread from there to germany . but there 's more to the christmas goose tradition than just that .
in earlier times , christians did n't only fast at easter but also during the 40 days between st. martin 's day and christmas .
on the first day of christmas , germans broke the fast with goose .
goods for the gods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stollen from dresden is famous around the world baking at christmas also dates back to an earlier time .
the germanic tribes offered the food as gifts to the gods .
even the calorie-conscious would be loath to avoid the baked goods that mark german christmas , including gingerbread cookies and stollen , a fruitcake with raisins and sometimes marzipan .
the latter , the most well-known of german holiday loaves , was created in 1457 by a cook at hartenstein castle near torgau .
covered in powdered sugar , the cake vaguely resembles a baby wrapped in a blanket - to bring to mind the birth of jesus christ . supposedly it 's bad luck to cut the stollen before the holiday .
on the other hand , if everyone gathers to eat it after christmas eve mass , the entire household will be protected and blessed .
but it seems that germans are no longer concerned by such superstition - years ago supermarkets started selling stollen as early as late summer . gaby reucher -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dear christmas child : letters from children while many american children send their christmas gift lists to santa , british kids write to father christmas , many germans address their letters to the christmas child .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to fears of bird flu , geese had to remain in their stalls this year " geese that have only been kept in their stalls and fattened up are really something different than geese that are allowed to graze in fields all summer long .
they 're more tender and lean . " the tradition of roast goose at christmas is centuries ' old .
in 1588 , queen elizabeth i of england ordered everyone to have roast goose for their christmas meal because it was the what she had been doing when news of the english victory over the spanish armada reached her .
goose then became the traditional christmas dish in england and spread from there to germany . but there 's more to the christmas goose tradition than just that .
in earlier times , christians did n't only fast at easter but also during the 40 days between st. martin 's day and christmas .
on the first day of christmas , germans broke the fast with goose .
goods for the gods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stollen from dresden is famous around the world baking at christmas also dates back to an earlier time .
the germanic tribes offered the food as gifts to the gods .
even the calorie-conscious would be loath to avoid the baked goods that mark german christmas , including gingerbread cookies and stollen , a fruitcake with raisins and sometimes marzipan .
the latter , the most well-known of german holiday loaves , was created in 1457 by a cook at hartenstein castle near torgau .
covered in powdered sugar , the cake vaguely resembles a baby wrapped in a blanket - to bring to mind the birth of jesus christ . supposedly it 's bad luck to cut the stollen before the holiday .
on the other hand , if everyone gathers to eat it after christmas eve mass , the entire household will be protected and blessed .
but it seems that germans are no longer concerned by such superstition - years ago supermarkets started selling stollen as early as late summer . gaby reucher -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dear christmas child : letters from children while many american children send their christmas gift lists to santa , british kids write to father christmas , many germans address their letters to the christmas child .

even so , germany still has to import them from poland and hungary .
siegrid höltel , who runs a farms that raises geese near cologne , does n't put great stock in fattening up geese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to fears of bird flu , geese had to remain in their stalls this year " geese that have only been kept in their stalls and fattened up are really something different than geese that are allowed to graze in fields all summer long .
they 're more tender and lean . " the tradition of roast goose at christmas is centuries ' old .
in 1588 , queen elizabeth i of england ordered everyone to have roast goose for their christmas meal because it was the what she had been doing when news of the english victory over the spanish armada reached her .
goose then became the traditional christmas dish in england and spread from there to germany . but there 's more to the christmas goose tradition than just that .
in earlier times , christians did n't only fast at easter but also during the 40 days between st. martin 's day and christmas .
on the first day of christmas , germans broke the fast with goose .
goods for the gods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stollen from dresden is famous around the world baking at christmas also dates back to an earlier time .
the germanic tribes offered the food as gifts to the gods .
even the calorie-conscious would be loath to avoid the baked goods that mark german christmas , including gingerbread cookies and stollen , a fruitcake with raisins and sometimes marzipan .
the latter , the most well-known of german holiday loaves , was created in 1457 by a cook at hartenstein castle near torgau .
covered in powdered sugar , the cake vaguely resembles a baby wrapped in a blanket - to bring to mind the birth of jesus christ . supposedly it 's bad luck to cut the stollen before the holiday .
on the other hand , if everyone gathers to eat it after christmas eve mass , the entire household will be protected and blessed .
but it seems that germans are no longer concerned by such superstition - years ago supermarkets started selling stollen as early as late summer . gaby reucher -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dear christmas child : letters from children while many american children send their christmas gift lists to santa , british kids write to father christmas , many germans address their letters to the christmas child .

even so , germany still has to import them from poland and hungary .
siegrid höltel , who runs a farms that raises geese near cologne , does n't put great stock in fattening up geese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to fears of bird flu , geese had to remain in their stalls this year " geese that have only been kept in their stalls and fattened up are really something different than geese that are allowed to graze in fields all summer long .
they 're more tender and lean . " the tradition of roast goose at christmas is centuries ' old .
in 1588 , queen elizabeth i of england ordered everyone to have roast goose for their christmas meal because it was the what she had been doing when news of the english victory over the spanish armada reached her .
goose then became the traditional christmas dish in england and spread from there to germany . but there 's more to the christmas goose tradition than just that .
in earlier times , christians did n't only fast at easter but also during the 40 days between st. martin 's day and christmas .
on the first day of christmas , germans broke the fast with goose .
goods for the gods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stollen from dresden is famous around the world baking at christmas also dates back to an earlier time .
the germanic tribes offered the food as gifts to the gods .
even the calorie-conscious would be loath to avoid the baked goods that mark german christmas , including gingerbread cookies and stollen , a fruitcake with raisins and sometimes marzipan .
the latter , the most well-known of german holiday loaves , was created in 1457 by a cook at hartenstein castle near torgau .
covered in powdered sugar , the cake vaguely resembles a baby wrapped in a blanket - to bring to mind the birth of jesus christ . supposedly it 's bad luck to cut the stollen before the holiday .
on the other hand , if everyone gathers to eat it after christmas eve mass , the entire household will be protected and blessed .
but it seems that germans are no longer concerned by such superstition - years ago supermarkets started selling stollen as early as late summer . gaby reucher -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dear christmas child : letters from children while many american children send their christmas gift lists to santa , british kids write to father christmas , many germans address their letters to the christmas child .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 25.12.2005 opinion : muslim involvement can help media perceptions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the more muslims get involved in the media , the more balanced representation will be when islam is covered in the german media , discussion frequently mixes political , social and religious issues .
debate on islamic topics can only gain in sophistication when more muslims are involved in producing content . german journalism has developed more sensibility and increased the knowledge about islam and muslim culture , some experts say . in late october , the evening broadcast on channel 3 , a public television station , featured the talk show " nachtcafé . "
it chose the " fear of islam " as its theme .
the invited guests were to discuss a number of very complex issues : terrorism , the potential for reform in islam , forced marriages , the headscarf , honor killing , and radical tendencies among young muslims in germany .
this combination of social , political , and religious topics under the label of islam has been increasingly apparent in the german media for a number of years , according to claudia dantschke , a freelance journalist in berlin .
" in germany we see an extremely homogenized discussion , " she said .
" in the past , this was accompanied by ethnic connotations .
this translated as an ' us ' - ethnic germans - versus ethnic turks , arabs , and so on .
the language has changed since sept .
11 . " now the debate is not one of ethnicity , but of culture , " dantschke added .
" this means that ' muslim ' currently stands as a synonym for what used to be referred to as ' arab ' or ' turk . '
this societal discussion is reflected in the media .
and the media does n't exist in a vacuum outside of society . "
of course , topics such as honor killing or the situation of young people from migrant families should be discussed in public .
the religious aspect , however , is only one among many and should not be misrepresented as providing the public with a deeper understanding of any particular issue or of being yet another underlying cause of certain problems .
devout or fa n atical ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : western journalists struggle to understand some religious forms of expression the generalizing manner in which the german media covers adherents of a world religion like islam is also a sign of difficulties within society .
many journalists in an overwhelmingly secular society find it difficult to deal with religious forms of expression .
how should they describe someone who prays five times a day or a woman who wears a headscarf ?
are they simply devout or already fanatics ?
yet , there is also something positive to report about the situation in the german media .
in recent years , islam and its rituals have managed to be covered regularly , even in the local press .
reports on the fast month of ramadan , on religious festivities , or on the " open-door " day at mosques appear regularly .
both muslim and non-muslim media observers have confirmed the increasing competency of german journalists in handling islamic topics .
" it is getting better to the extent that most journalists who used to approach us knew next to nothing about islam , " said ayman mazyek , editor in chief of the web site islam.de.
" they lacked even a basic knowledge of islam .
things have improved .
reporters writing about islam have developed a higher journalistic ethos . "
actors i n the media la n dscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : newspapers like the " islamische zeitung " in germany act as a bridge between cultures in addition , muslims in germany are no longer merely the objects of reporting in the german press , but have since become actors in the country 's media landscape .
one example is the newspaper islamische zeitu n g , established in 1996 .
it is published every three weeks with a circulation of 10,000 copies .
it aims to promote communication between muslims and serve as a bridge between islam and europe .
another example is the internet portal " islam.de , " which began in 1996 as an information forum of the central committee of muslims in germany .
today , the portal claims to provide critical and constructive reporting on islam and muslims , while contributing to a better understanding of islam .
ayman mazyek , however , has no illusions about the role played by the muslim media in germany : " in relation to the mass media , the few sprouts of muslim media here in germany are truly miniscule , " he said .
" they could , perhaps , enjoy a disproportionate influence in that it is currently difficult to report on islam or make a claim without also providing an account of what muslims themselves think on the issue .
it used to be the case – because we did n't have our own media institutions or the internet – that claims were simply published as is .
" now , at least , when reporters conduct their research , muslims can be found to have positions on any number of issues , " mazyek added .
" the result is that many disseminators of information in the media turn to authentic muslim web sites or newspapers to find out what muslims are saying and thinking . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : second and third generation muslim migrants have a unique view of life in germany a n i n depe n de n t islamic media ? yet one of the big problems is the question of loyalty in the media .
is islam.de truly independent or does it remain a mouthpiece for the central committee of muslims ?
is the controversial sheikh abdalqadir behind the islamische zeitung , as cologne journalist ahmet senyurt claims ?
both islam.de and the islamische zeitu n g have denied the charges . it 's remarkable , nonetheless , that so many young freelance journalists work in the muslim media .
it 's evident that second and third generation migrants want to have access to german society and engage in discussion .
it 's high time for german mass media to provide broader access to this social group by welcoming muslim journalists into their fold . mona naggar , qantara.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german media under fire from muslims the media in germany is often accused , not least by muslims in the country , of being one-sided and clichéd when it comes to reporting on them .
journalists deny it , saying discernment and responsibility are important .
-lrb- july 20 , 2005 -rrb- interfaith thinkers debate integration scientists , politicians and religious leaders met at a conference in berlin to discuss the issues of muslims living in western societies , stressing that better integration would be pivotal in curbing islamic extremism .

and many a traditional dish dates back to medieval times or even earlier . before they adopted christianity , germanic peoples celebrated winter solstice around the same time as christmas .
meals were cooked from whatever the year 's harvest brought in - grains , conserved fruit , potatoes .
everything was dished out for the holidays in one form or another . nowadays , many germans eat only salad or fish - a christian symbol since medieval times - on christmas eve .
on the first day of christmas , dec .
25 , they take to the table for a massive roast lunch .
traditionally , germans tuck into goose , and it remains popular . variations on goose just after the feast of st. martin on nov .
10 , which germans also celebrate with a meal of goose , farmers work to quickly fatten up their birds to meet the huge christmas demand for geese .
even so , germany still has to import them from poland and hungary .
siegrid höltel , who runs a farms that raises geese near cologne , does n't put great stock in fattening up geese .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to fears of bird flu , geese had to remain in their stalls this year " geese that have only been kept in their stalls and fattened up are really something different than geese that are allowed to graze in fields all summer long .
they 're more tender and lean . " the tradition of roast goose at christmas is centuries ' old .
in 1588 , queen elizabeth i of england ordered everyone to have roast goose for their christmas meal because it was the what she had been doing when news of the english victory over the spanish armada reached her .
goose then became the traditional christmas dish in england and spread from there to germany . but there 's more to the christmas goose tradition than just that .
in earlier times , christians did n't only fast at easter but also during the 40 days between st. martin 's day and christmas .
on the first day of christmas , germans broke the fast with goose .
goods for the gods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stollen from dresden is famous around the world baking at christmas also dates back to an earlier time .
the germanic tribes offered the food as gifts to the gods .
even the calorie-conscious would be loath to avoid the baked goods that mark german christmas , including gingerbread cookies and stollen , a fruitcake with raisins and sometimes marzipan .
the latter , the most well-known of german holiday loaves , was created in 1457 by a cook at hartenstein castle near torgau .
covered in powdered sugar , the cake vaguely resembles a baby wrapped in a blanket - to bring to mind the birth of jesus christ . supposedly it 's bad luck to cut the stollen before the holiday .
on the other hand , if everyone gathers to eat it after christmas eve mass , the entire household will be protected and blessed .
but it seems that germans are no longer concerned by such superstition - years ago supermarkets started selling stollen as early as late summer . gaby reucher -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dear christmas child : letters from children while many american children send their christmas gift lists to santa , british kids write to father christmas , many germans address their letters to the christmas child .
those letters end up in the town of engelskirchen .

twinkling lights and bright ornaments are the traditional dress for a christmas tree .
but some young german designers want to prove that flashy , ugly , spicy is the way to go , as they showed at an exhibition in karlsruhe . the atrium of the karlsruhe university of design smells like mulled wine .
after all , it 's hosting an exhibit on christmas trees : all bear a sign with their name and deal with the topic of the christmas tree in very different ways . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " super action " tree loves to attack visitors one of the most striking pieces is a plastic fir tree that can be operated by remote control .
it swirls around the hall on massive tires .
the tree is jostling visitors and other exhibits . stefan , who created the " super action christmas tree , " is controlling his invention from the stairway .
he 's forced to defend himself because of his tree 's bad manners . " well , we did n't know it at first , but the tree seems to enjoy jostling people 's feet , " said stefan .
" it 's obviously looking for some company . " sig n posts a n d torture pictures creative assistant stefan legner had an idea for the " hottest " exhibit in the hall : a christmas tree made from green chili peppers .
the sign next to it reads " darling , the tree is on fire . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christmas produces a lot of garbage , as this tree shows there 's plenty in the exhibition to keep visitors amused : there 's a tree made from green beer bottles or the " sign post forest , " a tree constructed out of three triangular right-of-way road signs on top of one another . but there are also some very serious exhibits . the only real living-room-like christmas tree in the entire atrium is decorated with electric lights and reveals its true identity only upon second glance . the ornaments are photos from the abu ghraib prison in iraq , showing american soldiers abusing prisoners .
in the background , a patriotic speech by us president george w. bush loops infinitely . umbrellas a n d toilet paper good ideas are the key to the christmas tree show .
sandra and moritz , who both study product design , organized this year 's exhibition .
last year , only students and professors took part in it .
but this time , other university employees were asked to create an exhibit . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this tree portrays the traditional headdress of the black forest many of them did .
the three janitors , for instance , made a tree from toilet paper . students and visitors alike are particularly impressed by the work of a staff member from administration .
she took the metal frame of an umbrella , sprayed it gold , and bent it so that it took the shape of a christmas tree .
moritz is delighted when he sees so much creativity . " it 's actually quite typical : just look at what somebody from the administration has created , " said moritz .
" you 'd think it was a student .
and then you think : hey , why do n't these people study here ? " art with calories as the evening progresses , two christmas trees are gaining increasing popularity : one that can be drunk and another one that can be eaten .
the tree made from full beer bottles seems to appear at the right time , as the organizers have run out of beer . in no time , the artists have also eaten up the multilayered christmas tree made from cake . " this tree actually reflects my understanding of christmas pretty nicely , " martin said .
" when i was a child , christmas always meant eating loads of great food .
here , you can finally eat christmas .

it seems that some germans love to rock around the christmas tree - but without annoying relatives being there .

debate on islamic topics can only gain in sophistication when more muslims are involved in producing content . german journalism has developed more sensibility and increased the knowledge about islam and muslim culture , some experts say . in late october , the evening broadcast on channel 3 , a public television station , featured the talk show " nachtcafé . "
it chose the " fear of islam " as its theme .
the invited guests were to discuss a number of very complex issues : terrorism , the potential for reform in islam , forced marriages , the headscarf , honor killing , and radical tendencies among young muslims in germany .
this combination of social , political , and religious topics under the label of islam has been increasingly apparent in the german media for a number of years , according to claudia dantschke , a freelance journalist in berlin .
" in germany we see an extremely homogenized discussion , " she said .
" in the past , this was accompanied by ethnic connotations .
this translated as an ' us ' - ethnic germans - versus ethnic turks , arabs , and so on .
the language has changed since sept .
11 . " now the debate is not one of ethnicity , but of culture , " dantschke added .
" this means that ' muslim ' currently stands as a synonym for what used to be referred to as ' arab ' or ' turk . '
this societal discussion is reflected in the media .
and the media does n't exist in a vacuum outside of society . "
of course , topics such as honor killing or the situation of young people from migrant families should be discussed in public .

many journalists in an overwhelmingly secular society find it difficult to deal with religious forms of expression .
how should they describe someone who prays five times a day or a woman who wears a headscarf ?
are they simply devout or already fanatics ?

in recent years , islam and its rituals have managed to be covered regularly , even in the local press .
reports on the fast month of ramadan , on religious festivities , or on the " open-door " day at mosques appear regularly .
both muslim and non-muslim media observers have confirmed the increasing competency of german journalists in handling islamic topics .
" it is getting better to the extent that most journalists who used to approach us knew next to nothing about islam , " said ayman mazyek , editor in chief of the web site islam.de.

today , the portal claims to provide critical and constructive reporting on islam and muslims , while contributing to a better understanding of islam .
ayman mazyek , however , has no illusions about the role played by the muslim media in germany : " in relation to the mass media , the few sprouts of muslim media here in germany are truly miniscule , " he said .
" they could , perhaps , enjoy a disproportionate influence in that it is currently difficult to report on islam or make a claim without also providing an account of what muslims themselves think on the issue .

the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- compared the death toll from two villages in sri lanka that were hit by the devastating giant waves .
two people died in the settlement with dense mangrove and scrub forest , while up to 6,000 people died in the village without similar vegetation .
many forests in the past were felled to build prawn farms and tourist resorts .
the iucn said it showed that healthy ecosystems acted as natural barriers .
" it saved a lot of lives as well as properties , " said vimukthi weeratunga , the union 's biodiversity coordinator in sri lanka .
" we have carried an out ecological assessment of the damage caused by the tsunami .
in some areas the damage was very minimal , and mangrove vegetation had played a role . "
now everyone is keen to plant a lot of mangroves in the coastal areas vimukthi weeratunga , iucn research has shown mangroves are able to absorb between 70-90 % of the energy from a normal wave .
there is , however , no reliable data on how the trees mitigate the impact of a tsunami .
many people living in coastal areas now want to see their communities benefit from the apparent protection offered by mangrove forests .
" people tend to respect these natural barriers even more , especially after the tsunami , " mr weeratunga said .

slow recovery coral reefs were also in the direct path of the tsunami .

but they did not escape unharmed .
debris and silt from the shore was washed out to sea and covered the reefs .
one year on : environmental impact of the tsunami disaster at-a-glance twelve months later , the iucn has found that reefs which were in good shape before the waves struck are recovering much more quickly than degraded sites .
lucy emerton , head of the union 's ecosystems and livelihoods group in asia , explained why .
" healthy coral reefs are much more robust in terms of recovering from either natural or man-made disasters , " she told the bbc news website .
" physically , you see a beautiful coral reef that is coming back to life rather than one that is still smothered in debris . "
many of the reefs in the indian ocean had been damaged from dynamite fishing , coral mining and bleaching .
the protection that healthy marine and coastal ecosystems provided during the disaster highlighted the need for effective environmental policies , ms emerton said .
damaged coral has been slower to recover from the tsunami " it was immediately obvious what an important role mangrove forests , wetlands and coral reefs played in mitigating the impact -lsb- of the tsunami -rsb- , " she argued .
" it has led to a real step forward in looking at integrated coastal management systems . "
she said strong conservation laws already existed but there had been questions about how effective they had been enforced .
one example of a local government flexing its conservation muscles is the recent declaration to establish two new turtle sanctuaries in southern sri lanka .
elsewhere , four international conservation groups , led by wetlands international , have launched a project called green coast .
working alongside local governments and construction companies , the project hopes to rehabilitate the habitat in areas affected by the disaster .
fishing fears both mangrove forests and coral reefs found in coastal areas provide vital protection and breeding grounds for fish - a key source of income and nutrition for people in the region .
a report published by the malaysian-based worldfish center has warned that misplaced investment by donors could do more harm than good in the long term .
when the giant waves swept inland in december 2004 , between 80-90 % of the fishing fleet was destroyed .
this prompted a massive effort by the international community to replace lost vessels and gear .
international donors were quick to replace destroyed fishing boats while welcoming the overwhelming response , the centre 's director general , stephen hall , said it was important for donors to coordinate their efforts with the governments .
" there is a real danger that we are going to set these communities back on the downward spiral of unsustainable fish stocks , " he said .
" the indonesian government estimates that 10,500 boats were lost -lsb- in aceh -rsb- .
of those , around 2,500 were repaired .
recent estimates put the number of boats that have been built or in the process of being built at around 10,800 .
" so we now have 2,800 more boats than we started with . "
dr hall said this created the potential to place even greater pressure on already overexploited stocks .
this view is shared by the iucn 's vimukthi weeratunga .
" immediately after the tsunami , a lot of the ngos and other well wishers were distributing boats .
" but we saw the distribution of too many boats and an increase in fishing . "
latest figures from the un farming and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- show fish catches in aceh for 2005 are down 41 % for marine fishing and 26 % for brackish water aquaculture .
balancing act the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- published a report in november highlighting the challenges of meeting the demands of the mammoth relief effort without exacerbating the damage to the environment .
it warned that haphazard groundwater extraction , unsanitary disposal of waste , chaotic rebuilding of homes and unsustainable timber harvesting could result in more environmental damage , leading to an increase in poverty and greater vulnerability to future disasters .
a number of agencies , including the fao and unep , are working closely with the governments of nations affected by the disaster .

two people died in the settlement with dense mangrove and scrub forest , while up to 6,000 people died in the village without similar vegetation .

the world conservation union -lrb- iucn -rrb- compared the death toll from two villages in sri lanka that were hit by the devastating giant waves .
two people died in the settlement with dense mangrove and scrub forest , while up to 6,000 people died in the village without similar vegetation .
many forests in the past were felled to build prawn farms and tourist resorts .
the iucn said it showed that healthy ecosystems acted as natural barriers .
" it saved a lot of lives as well as properties , " said vimukthi weeratunga , the union 's biodiversity coordinator in sri lanka .
" we have carried an out ecological assessment of the damage caused by the tsunami .
in some areas the damage was very minimal , and mangrove vegetation had played a role . "
" now everyone is keen to plant a lot of mangroves in the coastal areas " vimukthi weeratunga , iucn research has shown mangroves are able to absorb between 70-90 % of the energy from a normal wave .
there is , however , no reliable data on how the trees mitigate the impact of a tsunami .
many people living in coastal areas now want to see their communities benefit from the apparent protection offered by mangrove forests .
" people tend to respect these natural barriers even more , especially after the tsunami , " mr weeratunga said .
" now everyone is keen to plant a lot of mangroves in the coastal areas but unfortunately we can not plant mangroves everywhere . "
slow recovery coral reefs were also in the direct path of the tsunami .
fears for these ecosystems were allayed after initial surveys found that there had not been widespread , long-term damage .
but they did not escape unharmed .
debris and silt from the shore was washed out to sea and covered the reefs .
twelve months later , the iucn has found that reefs which were in good shape before the waves struck are recovering much more quickly than degraded sites .
lucy emerton , head of the union 's ecosystems and livelihoods group in asia , explained why .
" healthy coral reefs are much more robust in terms of recovering from either natural or man-made disasters , " she told the bbc news website .
" physically , you see a beautiful coral reef that is coming back to life rather than one that is still smothered in debris . "
many of the reefs in the indian ocean had been damaged from dynamite fishing , coral mining and bleaching .
the protection that healthy marine and coastal ecosystems provided during the disaster highlighted the need for effective environmental policies , ms emerton said .
" it was immediately obvious what an important role mangrove forests , wetlands and coral reefs played in mitigating the impact -lsb- of the tsunami -rsb- , " she argued .
" it has led to a real step forward in looking at integrated coastal management systems . "
she said strong conservation laws already existed but there had been questions about how effective they had been enforced .
one example of a local government flexing its conservation muscles is the recent declaration to establish two new turtle sanctuaries in southern sri lanka .
elsewhere , four international conservation groups , led by wetlands international , have launched a project called green coast .
working alongside local governments and construction companies , the project hopes to rehabilitate the habitat in areas affected by the disaster .
fishing fears both mangrove forests and coral reefs found in coastal areas provide vital protection and breeding grounds for fish - a key source of income and nutrition for people in the region .
a report published by the malaysian-based worldfish center has warned that misplaced investment by donors could do more harm than good in the long term .
when the giant waves swept inland in december 2004 , between 80-90 % of the fishing fleet was destroyed .
this prompted a massive effort by the international community to replace lost vessels and gear .
while welcoming the overwhelming response , the centre 's director general , stephen hall , said it was important for donors to coordinate their efforts with the governments .
" there is a real danger that we are going to set these communities back on the downward spiral of unsustainable fish stocks , " he said .
" the indonesian government estimates that 10,500 boats were lost -lsb- in aceh -rsb- .
of those , around 2,500 were repaired .
recent estimates put the number of boats that have been built or in the process of being built at around 10,800 .
" so we now have 2,800 more boats than we started with . "
dr hall said this created the potential to place even greater pressure on already overexploited stocks .
this view is shared by the iucn 's vimukthi weeratunga .
" immediately after the tsunami , a lot of the ngos and other well wishers were distributing boats .
" but we saw the distribution of too many boats and an increase in fishing . "
latest figures from the un farming and agriculture organization -lrb- fao -rrb- show fish catches in aceh for 2005 are down 41 % for marine fishing and 26 % for brackish water aquaculture .
balancing act the united nations environment programme -lrb- unep -rrb- published a report in november highlighting the challenges of meeting the demands of the mammoth relief effort without exacerbating the damage to the environment .
it warned that haphazard groundwater extraction , unsanitary disposal of waste , chaotic rebuilding of homes and unsustainable timber harvesting could result in more environmental damage , leading to an increase in poverty and greater vulnerability to future disasters .
a number of agencies , including the fao and unep , are working closely with the governments of nations affected by the disaster .
help is being provided in a number of areas , such as offering technical assistance to overstretched environment ministries and coordinating the mobilisation of funding .
as attention begins to focus on the future , vimukthi weeratunga warns that there are no quick fixes when it comes to repairing the environmental damage .
" it will take five to seven years , at least , to get to the pre-tsunami stage - and that is a conservative estimate . "

jan price and son wayne , from gorlas , carmarthenshire , wales , say the spider will cast a shadow over festivities .
one theory is the spider - described as the size of a cd - has wandered into the house from a nearby property .
mrs price said her son first spotted the spider when he was watching tv in his bedroom in november .
a week later mrs price saw the spider herself while tidying the house .
" i thought something had fallen from the dresser but when i went and had a look , i saw what looked like a massive ball of grey wool running from the radiator underneath the bed , " she said .
" it was not a normal spider - it was the size of a cd . "
the sighting prompted angina-prone mrs price to move out to a friend 's house , while wayne , 24 , went to his girlfriend 's .
register call local snake and spider expert geraint hopkins placed traps baited with locusts in the semi-detached house to snare the spider .
but the unwelcome visitor - thought to match the description of a chilean red tarantula - has not been seen since the start of the month and the family have returned home . "
my daughter is coming back for christmas but will be staying over " jan price mrs price is against fumigating the house as the spider 's remains could stay hidden .
she can not relax until it is carried out of the house " dead or alive " .
no-one has come forward to claim the tarantula and it has led to calls for a register on people keeping exotic animals .
" the friends that do call at the house these days look at the floor when they talk to you , " mrs price said .
" my daughter is coming back for christmas but will be staying over at a neighbour 's house during the nights because she can not face sleeping here . "
