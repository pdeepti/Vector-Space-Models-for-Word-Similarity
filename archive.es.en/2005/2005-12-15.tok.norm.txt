" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
more questions about the level of involvement of the german authorities in such cases have been raised by a detainee at the us military prison at guantanamo bay . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny involvement in cia affair during bundestag hearings on wednesday , the german government denied any involvement in the alleged cia abductions of suspected terrorists , but not all parliamentarians were convinced .

as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .

the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .

they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .
the new states , which have to detail how they would spend their money would also like to start planning where their funds will go . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what germany wants from the eu budget battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .
meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2005 what germany wants from the eu budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing brussels for the big family gathering battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .
meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich . " there are calculations that show that no matter what political area the eu makes more money available to , it always costs the german government more than it receives , " he said .
" that is why germany is following a goal of keeping the eu budget down . " germany has long been europe 's biggest net contributor , and with the eu 's biggest economy , it was responsible for about 22 percent of 2004 's budget of 99.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- . protecting eastern germany during her first european financial negotiations , merkel will also aim to retain the funds brussels sends to structurally-weak areas of eastern germany , despite the addition of 10 , mostly poorer , member states who would otherwise receive the money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping eu money flowing to eastern germany is one of merkel 's goals " another goal for the germans in these negotiations is to make sure the eastern german states continue to receive the highest level of support from the structural funds without these funds being heavily reduced , " becker said . after spending last week talking to nearly half of the european union 's 25 heads of state , british prime minister tony blair , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of 2005 , brought out a new budget proposal wednesday that allocated more money to the structural and regional aid . berlin a bridge between paris and london the new framework , which increased spending to 849.3 billion euros , or 1.03 percent of gross national income , from the 847 billion that was widely-rejected last week , maintains the cherished british rebate and calls for review of the entire budget in 2009 , a measure paris rejects to prevent cuts to the 10 billion euros it receives from eu agriculture payouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has already visited chirac and blair " germany can build a bridge , " maruhn said .
" france is actively working against the british rebate , great britain is actively working against the common agriculture policy , and germany has a more moderate position in both points and is financially between great britain and france . " european commission president jose barroso agreed germany is in a position to help europe is best able to move forward when germany is active . " ' europe has always moved forward when germany has taken a mediating role , he said in an interview with germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper . but working to close the considerable gap along the english channel may not be enough .
poland , spain , lithuania and the netherlands have all voiced varying degrees of opposition to the draft , and the budget needs the unanimous support of all member states to be ratified . success far from certain eu leaders already failed to reach agreement on the budget in june , and while the politicians have said they want a compromise this week , no one expects them to make a bad deal simply for the sake of crossing it off their to-do list . the bloc , which has been reeling since french and dutch voters rejected the european constitution in june , is in dire need of a success story , even though failure would not be a complete disaster as a deal can still be agreed to next year . " the last time there were negotiations agreement was reached nine months before the finance framework went into effect , " maruhn said .
" now , with an aggravated starting point and considerably more eu partners , i have a bit of a problem seeing agreement coming sooner than occurred six years ago when there was less potential for conflict .

meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich . " there are calculations that show that no matter what political area the eu makes more money available to , it always costs the german government more than it receives , " he said .
" that is why germany is following a goal of keeping the eu budget down . " germany has long been europe 's biggest net contributor , and with the eu 's biggest economy , it was responsible for about 22 percent of 2004 's budget of 99.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- . protecting eastern germany during her first european financial negotiations , merkel will also aim to retain the funds brussels sends to structurally-weak areas of eastern germany , despite the addition of 10 , mostly poorer , member states who would otherwise receive the money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping eu money flowing to eastern germany is one of merkel 's goals " another goal for the germans in these negotiations is to make sure the eastern german states continue to receive the highest level of support from the structural funds without these funds being heavily reduced , " becker said . after spending last week talking to nearly half of the european union 's 25 heads of state , british prime minister tony blair , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of 2005 , brought out a new budget proposal wednesday that allocated more money to the structural and regional aid . berlin a bridge between paris and london the new framework , which increased spending to 849.3 billion euros , or 1.03 percent of gross national income , from the 847 billion that was widely-rejected last week , maintains the cherished british rebate and calls for review of the entire budget in 2009 , a measure paris rejects to prevent cuts to the 10 billion euros it receives from eu agriculture payouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has already visited chirac and blair " germany can build a bridge , " maruhn said .
" france is actively working against the british rebate , great britain is actively working against the common agriculture policy , and germany has a more moderate position in both points and is financially between great britain and france . " european commission president jose barroso agreed germany is in a position to help europe is best able to move forward when germany is active . " ' europe has always moved forward when germany has taken a mediating role , he said in an interview with germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper . but working to close the considerable gap along the english channel may not be enough .
poland , spain , lithuania and the netherlands have all voiced varying degrees of opposition to the draft , and the budget needs the unanimous support of all member states to be ratified . success far from certain eu leaders already failed to reach agreement on the budget in june , and while the politicians have said they want a compromise this week , no one expects them to make a bad deal simply for the sake of crossing it off their to-do list . the bloc , which has been reeling since french and dutch voters rejected the european constitution in june , is in dire need of a success story , even though failure would not be a complete disaster as a deal can still be agreed to next year . " the last time there were negotiations agreement was reached nine months before the finance framework went into effect , " maruhn said .
" now , with an aggravated starting point and considerably more eu partners , i have a bit of a problem seeing agreement coming sooner than occurred six years ago when there was less potential for conflict .

" i hope we will be able to reach an agreement , " said swedish prime minister goeran persson , but added : " i 'm not sure .
there are still many problems to solve . " estonian prime minister andrus ansip said the latest british compromise proposal , presented on the eve of the brussels summit , was an improvement but was still not there .
" the second proposal is better than the first one and it is a step forward in the right direction , but it is still a short step forward .
this proposal is not supporting -lrb- eu -rrb- enlargement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit in brussels runs through friday the budget , when finally agreed , will release much needed funds to the 10 new states which joined last year , many of them relatively poor former communist countries . slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda , a close political ally of blair among the ex-communist countries which joined the eu last year , was upbeat about prospects for a deal .
" this is a good basis for negotiations and a final compromise , " he said .
no promise of a deal luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , who failed to broker a budget agreement when he hosted an eu summit in june , warned that success was far from guaranteed this time .
" i am neither optimistic nor pessimistic , " he said .
" we need an agreement , but a lot of things need to happen for that .
we need to move closer to the british , and the british to us .
it may happen but it may not happen , " he said . denmark 's anders fogh rasmussen was more blunt .
" i think we need a new proposal in which there is improvements for the new members states , and it can be financed by cuts in the british rebate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel 's country takes over the rotating eu presidency in january austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , who takes over the eu presidency from britain next month - and who will have to cope with the budget standoff if this week 's summit fails - said the bloc was moving slowly towards a deal .
" i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly , but i think we are moving in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe and not a divided europe , and i think everybody knows it , " he said . german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit since taking office , said : " we will do everything possible .
-lrb- we will -rrb- try our best ...
we can not say now if we will be able to come to an agreement . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso called on eu leaders thursday to hammer out a " credible " budget deal capable of funding the bloc 's expansion into eastern europe .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.12.2005 promoting germany 's young scientists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german researchers could be looking at a bright future this month marks 40 years since the birth of germany 's young researchers competition .
" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2005 what germany wants from the eu budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing brussels for the big family gathering battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .
meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich . " there are calculations that show that no matter what political area the eu makes more money available to , it always costs the german government more than it receives , " he said .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

but new outbreaks and continued emergency planning shows the possibility of a pandemic is still very real . budget problems , diplomatic spats with iran , trade arguments with the united states and , of course , the looming christmas holidays ; the pages of the european press are full of news telling the people that the continent has a lot on its plate this december . but thankfully there 's very little about bird flu .
there are fewer headlines about poultry culls on the front pages , rare reports on panic buying of the tamiflu vaccine and when the disease does find its way past stories about the top 10 toys to buy this christmas , it comes in the form of seemingly good news . on wednesday , germany announced that it was lifting its restrictions on keeping poultry shut inside because the season in which birds migrate from europe to warmer climes has ended .
germany 's friedrich löffler scientific institute , advisors to the german government on bird diseases , also reduced its risk assessment on the spread of the disease to germany to low from " high to moderate . " and it 's not just germany either .
austria , the netherlands and switzerland are among the other european countries which are now relaxing their regulations on poultry . europe can breathe a sigh of relief and join in a collective chorus of " that was a close one . " or can it ? ukrai n e a n d roma n ia a n n ou n ce n ew h5n1 outbreaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ukraine , 11 out of 25 quarantined villages have been confirmed as h5n1 outbreaks .
at the same time that germany announced it will allow chickens , ducks , geese , turkeys and pheasants to breed outdoors for the first time since being confined to sheds in mid-october , ukraine admitted that bird flu has been detected in 25 villages in the country 's crimea peninsula , 11 of which have confirmed outbreaks of the deadly h5n1 strain . nearly 54,000 birds had been rounded up and destroyed in the affected villages and 513 residents remain under medical observation .
president viktor yushchenko has invoked a state of emergency . meanwhile , four villages in southeast romania have been quarantined after the presence of an h5-subtype of bird flu was confirmed , suggesting that the virus was spreading outside the danube delta , where the deadly h5n1 virus has been confirmed in recent weeks . in areas of belarus , russia , kazakhstan and bulgaria import bans and culls continue .
bulgaria banned import and transit of poultry meat , eggs and live birds from ukraine while russia , which has its own h5n1 outbreaks to contend with , and kazakhstan imposed similar bans this month . huma n death toll rises i n the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far east continues to be the epicenter of bird flu outbreaks .
in the far east , where the most recent outbreaks originated from , the human death toll continues to rise .
indonesia confirmed its ninth human death from bird flu on tuesday , taking the global death toll from the disease to 71 , all in asia . in vietnam , a toddler who died on monday was suspected of having succumbed to the disease although doctors have ruled out the h5n1 virus as the cause despite large numbers of dead ducks being found near the child 's home in the city of can tho . while bird flu has dropped down the western european news agenda , governments on the continent are still hugely concerned about the threat of a flu pandemic among humans which could kill millions and cause massive economic losses . europe worki n g hard to protect a n d pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu announced that it would have sufficient plans and vaccines in place by 2007 .
france recently announced that confinement measures it enforced in october would be extended until the end of may .
spain 's agriculture ministry followed suit said it was extending measures imposed on nov .
30 through to may 31 .
germany said it will review its own situation before bird migration begins again next year . the european union is continuing to plan for a pandemic and announced this week that it would be prepared for such an event by 2007 . " over the next couple of months , i think europe will be much better off than any other continent to face a pandemic , " european commission director of public health fernand sauer told a news conference in stockholm on wednesday . " we are in a time of ' peace ' , and in a time of peace we have to prepare ... to mitigate the effects " of a pandemic , he said .
" at the end of 2007 , potentially we could cover between 20 and 25 percent of the european population ...
if -lrb- a pandemic -rrb- happens next week , there will be a shortage -lrb- of vaccines -rrb- but if it happens in 2007 , there will probably be enough , " he added . the much-publicized scare of october may have passed from europe 's public consciousness but the continent is far from delivering an " all-clear .

at the same time that germany announced it will allow chickens , ducks , geese , turkeys and pheasants to breed outdoors for the first time since being confined to sheds in mid-october , ukraine admitted that bird flu has been detected in 25 villages in the country 's crimea peninsula , 11 of which have confirmed outbreaks of the deadly h5n1 strain . nearly 54,000 birds had been rounded up and destroyed in the affected villages and 513 residents remain under medical observation .
president viktor yushchenko has invoked a state of emergency . meanwhile , four villages in southeast romania have been quarantined after the presence of an h5-subtype of bird flu was confirmed , suggesting that the virus was spreading outside the danube delta , where the deadly h5n1 virus has been confirmed in recent weeks . in areas of belarus , russia , kazakhstan and bulgaria import bans and culls continue .
bulgaria banned import and transit of poultry meat , eggs and live birds from ukraine while russia , which has its own h5n1 outbreaks to contend with , and kazakhstan imposed similar bans this month . huma n death toll rises i n the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far east continues to be the epicenter of bird flu outbreaks .
in the far east , where the most recent outbreaks originated from , the human death toll continues to rise .
indonesia confirmed its ninth human death from bird flu on tuesday , taking the global death toll from the disease to 71 , all in asia . in vietnam , a toddler who died on monday was suspected of having succumbed to the disease although doctors have ruled out the h5n1 virus as the cause despite large numbers of dead ducks being found near the child 's home in the city of can tho . while bird flu has dropped down the western european news agenda , governments on the continent are still hugely concerned about the threat of a flu pandemic among humans which could kill millions and cause massive economic losses . europe worki n g hard to protect a n d pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu announced that it would have sufficient plans and vaccines in place by 2007 .
france recently announced that confinement measures it enforced in october would be extended until the end of may .
spain 's agriculture ministry followed suit said it was extending measures imposed on nov .
30 through to may 31 .
germany said it will review its own situation before bird migration begins again next year . the european union is continuing to plan for a pandemic and announced this week that it would be prepared for such an event by 2007 . " over the next couple of months , i think europe will be much better off than any other continent to face a pandemic , " european commission director of public health fernand sauer told a news conference in stockholm on wednesday . " we are in a time of ' peace ' , and in a time of peace we have to prepare ... to mitigate the effects " of a pandemic , he said .
" at the end of 2007 , potentially we could cover between 20 and 25 percent of the european population ...
if -lrb- a pandemic -rrb- happens next week , there will be a shortage -lrb- of vaccines -rrb- but if it happens in 2007 , there will probably be enough , " he added . the much-publicized scare of october may have passed from europe 's public consciousness but the continent is far from delivering an " all-clear .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2005 what germany wants from the eu budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing brussels for the big family gathering battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .
meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich . " there are calculations that show that no matter what political area the eu makes more money available to , it always costs the german government more than it receives , " he said .
" that is why germany is following a goal of keeping the eu budget down . " germany has long been europe 's biggest net contributor , and with the eu 's biggest economy , it was responsible for about 22 percent of 2004 's budget of 99.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- . protecting eastern germany during her first european financial negotiations , merkel will also aim to retain the funds brussels sends to structurally-weak areas of eastern germany , despite the addition of 10 , mostly poorer , member states who would otherwise receive the money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping eu money flowing to eastern germany is one of merkel 's goals " another goal for the germans in these negotiations is to make sure the eastern german states continue to receive the highest level of support from the structural funds without these funds being heavily reduced , " becker said . after spending last week talking to nearly half of the european union 's 25 heads of state , british prime minister tony blair , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of 2005 , brought out a new budget proposal wednesday that allocated more money to the structural and regional aid . berlin a bridge between paris and london the new framework , which increased spending to 849.3 billion euros , or 1.03 percent of gross national income , from the 847 billion that was widely-rejected last week , maintains the cherished british rebate and calls for review of the entire budget in 2009 , a measure paris rejects to prevent cuts to the 10 billion euros it receives from eu agriculture payouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has already visited chirac and blair " germany can build a bridge , " maruhn said .
" france is actively working against the british rebate , great britain is actively working against the common agriculture policy , and germany has a more moderate position in both points and is financially between great britain and france . " european commission president jose barroso agreed germany is in a position to help europe is best able to move forward when germany is active . " ' europe has always moved forward when germany has taken a mediating role , he said in an interview with germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper . but working to close the considerable gap along the english channel may not be enough .
poland , spain , lithuania and the netherlands have all voiced varying degrees of opposition to the draft , and the budget needs the unanimous support of all member states to be ratified . success far from certain eu leaders already failed to reach agreement on the budget in june , and while the politicians have said they want a compromise this week , no one expects them to make a bad deal simply for the sake of crossing it off their to-do list . the bloc , which has been reeling since french and dutch voters rejected the european constitution in june , is in dire need of a success story , even though failure would not be a complete disaster as a deal can still be agreed to next year . " the last time there were negotiations agreement was reached nine months before the finance framework went into effect , " maruhn said .
" now , with an aggravated starting point and considerably more eu partners , i have a bit of a problem seeing agreement coming sooner than occurred six years ago when there was less potential for conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2005 eu finances : how do they work ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no time for lying around when it comes to dividing up europe 's money the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .
dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .
the new states , which have to detail how they would spend their money would also like to start planning where their funds will go . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what germany wants from the eu budget battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .
meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet .

15 , 2005 -rrb- no better deal to come says britain as europe nears crisis britain 's second draft of budget proposals will be its last for the forseeable future , officials said wednesday as germany and the rest of the eu urged the presidency to avoid an imminent crisis .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.12.2005 german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's called the holocaust a " myth " and said israel should be moved to europe the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .
editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .

but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being .

" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2005 what germany wants from the eu budget großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : preparing brussels for the big family gathering battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .
meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich .

meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich . " there are calculations that show that no matter what political area the eu makes more money available to , it always costs the german government more than it receives , " he said .
" that is why germany is following a goal of keeping the eu budget down .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2005 eu finances : how do they work ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no time for lying around when it comes to dividing up europe 's money the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .
dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .
the new states , which have to detail how they would spend their money would also like to start planning where their funds will go . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what germany wants from the eu budget battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .

" schröder crossed a line and discredited all of politics in the eyes of the people , " edmund stoiber , head christian social union , told the münchner merkur newspaper thursday . schröder supported by spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering put his support behind schröder though the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats did not want to take an official stand on the former german chancellor 's position , opposition leaders managed to earn enough votes to summon vice chancellor franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- to the plenary session . one of schröder 's closest confidents , müntefering said it was not up to the current administration to make judgments on what kinds of work former politicians should or should not accept .
he also said he was convinced schröder would act in germany 's best interest . " i 'm personally glad he did it , " müntefering said .
" it is a strategic project for all of europe . " earlier this week schröder defended his new post , calling it an honor to lead the project that would bring gas from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
the pipeline project is 51 percent owned by russia 's gazprom , while the german firms e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . social democratic head and former defense minister under schröder , peter struck , also said schröder 's participation in the project would be good for germany . opposition calls for about-face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline will deliver russian gas to germany leading free market liberal fdp parliamentarian wolfgang gerhardt , on the other hand , contended " it is not in germany 's interest " for schröder to take a position in a company " that is significantly run by the kremlin . " " german-russian relations are important , but they should n't be used to sweep under the carpet what the former chancellor is doing here , " gerhardt said .
" gerhard schröder has no regard for the principals that he represented with the active support of the social democrats . " christian democrat hermann gröhe also distanced himself from schröder 's decision , saying it " raised many questions . " members of the green party , which was the junior governing partner in schröder 's administration , and the left party , made up mainly of members of the former communist pds , appealed to schröder to change his mind and turn down the position . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : schröder undoing his own legacy by being willing to take over a leading role in the consortium for building the baltic sea pipeline , former chancellor schröder is doing a disservice to the german-russian relations , says dw-world 's ingo mannteufel .

" i hope we will be able to reach an agreement , " said swedish prime minister goeran persson , but added : " i 'm not sure .
there are still many problems to solve . " estonian prime minister andrus ansip said the latest british compromise proposal , presented on the eve of the brussels summit , was an improvement but was still not there .
" the second proposal is better than the first one and it is a step forward in the right direction , but it is still a short step forward .
this proposal is not supporting -lrb- eu -rrb- enlargement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit in brussels runs through friday the budget , when finally agreed , will release much needed funds to the 10 new states which joined last year , many of them relatively poor former communist countries . slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda , a close political ally of blair among the ex-communist countries which joined the eu last year , was upbeat about prospects for a deal .
" this is a good basis for negotiations and a final compromise , " he said .
no promise of a deal luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , who failed to broker a budget agreement when he hosted an eu summit in june , warned that success was far from guaranteed this time .
" i am neither optimistic nor pessimistic , " he said .
" we need an agreement , but a lot of things need to happen for that .
we need to move closer to the british , and the british to us .
it may happen but it may not happen , " he said . denmark 's anders fogh rasmussen was more blunt .
" i think we need a new proposal in which there is improvements for the new members states , and it can be financed by cuts in the british rebate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel 's country takes over the rotating eu presidency in january austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , who takes over the eu presidency from britain next month - and who will have to cope with the budget standoff if this week 's summit fails - said the bloc was moving slowly towards a deal .
" i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly , but i think we are moving in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe and not a divided europe , and i think everybody knows it , " he said . german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit since taking office , said : " we will do everything possible .
-lrb- we will -rrb- try our best ...
we can not say now if we will be able to come to an agreement . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso called on eu leaders thursday to hammer out a " credible " budget deal capable of funding the bloc 's expansion into eastern europe .

meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich . " there are calculations that show that no matter what political area the eu makes more money available to , it always costs the german government more than it receives , " he said .
" that is why germany is following a goal of keeping the eu budget down . " germany has long been europe 's biggest net contributor , and with the eu 's biggest economy , it was responsible for about 22 percent of 2004 's budget of 99.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- . protecting eastern germany during her first european financial negotiations , merkel will also aim to retain the funds brussels sends to structurally-weak areas of eastern germany , despite the addition of 10 , mostly poorer , member states who would otherwise receive the money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping eu money flowing to eastern germany is one of merkel 's goals " another goal for the germans in these negotiations is to make sure the eastern german states continue to receive the highest level of support from the structural funds without these funds being heavily reduced , " becker said . after spending last week talking to nearly half of the european union 's 25 heads of state , british prime minister tony blair , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of 2005 , brought out a new budget proposal wednesday that allocated more money to the structural and regional aid . berlin a bridge between paris and london the new framework , which increased spending to 849.3 billion euros , or 1.03 percent of gross national income , from the 847 billion that was widely-rejected last week , maintains the cherished british rebate and calls for review of the entire budget in 2009 , a measure paris rejects to prevent cuts to the 10 billion euros it receives from eu agriculture payouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has already visited chirac and blair " germany can build a bridge , " maruhn said .
" france is actively working against the british rebate , great britain is actively working against the common agriculture policy , and germany has a more moderate position in both points and is financially between great britain and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2005 eu finances : how do they work ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no time for lying around when it comes to dividing up europe 's money the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .
dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .
the new states , which have to detail how they would spend their money would also like to start planning where their funds will go . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what germany wants from the eu budget battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .
meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet .

meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich . " there are calculations that show that no matter what political area the eu makes more money available to , it always costs the german government more than it receives , " he said .
" that is why germany is following a goal of keeping the eu budget down . " germany has long been europe 's biggest net contributor , and with the eu 's biggest economy , it was responsible for about 22 percent of 2004 's budget of 99.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- . protecting eastern germany during her first european financial negotiations , merkel will also aim to retain the funds brussels sends to structurally-weak areas of eastern germany , despite the addition of 10 , mostly poorer , member states who would otherwise receive the money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping eu money flowing to eastern germany is one of merkel 's goals " another goal for the germans in these negotiations is to make sure the eastern german states continue to receive the highest level of support from the structural funds without these funds being heavily reduced , " becker said . after spending last week talking to nearly half of the european union 's 25 heads of state , british prime minister tony blair , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of 2005 , brought out a new budget proposal wednesday that allocated more money to the structural and regional aid . berlin a bridge between paris and london the new framework , which increased spending to 849.3 billion euros , or 1.03 percent of gross national income , from the 847 billion that was widely-rejected last week , maintains the cherished british rebate and calls for review of the entire budget in 2009 , a measure paris rejects to prevent cuts to the 10 billion euros it receives from eu agriculture payouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has already visited chirac and blair " germany can build a bridge , " maruhn said .
" france is actively working against the british rebate , great britain is actively working against the common agriculture policy , and germany has a more moderate position in both points and is financially between great britain and france . " european commission president jose barroso agreed germany is in a position to help europe is best able to move forward when germany is active . " ' europe has always moved forward when germany has taken a mediating role , he said in an interview with germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper . but working to close the considerable gap along the english channel may not be enough .
poland , spain , lithuania and the netherlands have all voiced varying degrees of opposition to the draft , and the budget needs the unanimous support of all member states to be ratified . success far from certain eu leaders already failed to reach agreement on the budget in june , and while the politicians have said they want a compromise this week , no one expects them to make a bad deal simply for the sake of crossing it off their to-do list . the bloc , which has been reeling since french and dutch voters rejected the european constitution in june , is in dire need of a success story , even though failure would not be a complete disaster as a deal can still be agreed to next year . " the last time there were negotiations agreement was reached nine months before the finance framework went into effect , " maruhn said .
" now , with an aggravated starting point and considerably more eu partners , i have a bit of a problem seeing agreement coming sooner than occurred six years ago when there was less potential for conflict .

" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is .

" i hope we will be able to reach an agreement , " said swedish prime minister goeran persson , but added : " i 'm not sure .
there are still many problems to solve . " estonian prime minister andrus ansip said the latest british compromise proposal , presented on the eve of the brussels summit , was an improvement but was still not there .
" the second proposal is better than the first one and it is a step forward in the right direction , but it is still a short step forward .
this proposal is not supporting -lrb- eu -rrb- enlargement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit in brussels runs through friday the budget , when finally agreed , will release much needed funds to the 10 new states which joined last year , many of them relatively poor former communist countries . slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda , a close political ally of blair among the ex-communist countries which joined the eu last year , was upbeat about prospects for a deal .
" this is a good basis for negotiations and a final compromise , " he said .
no promise of a deal luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , who failed to broker a budget agreement when he hosted an eu summit in june , warned that success was far from guaranteed this time .
" i am neither optimistic nor pessimistic , " he said .
" we need an agreement , but a lot of things need to happen for that .
we need to move closer to the british , and the british to us .
it may happen but it may not happen , " he said . denmark 's anders fogh rasmussen was more blunt .
" i think we need a new proposal in which there is improvements for the new members states , and it can be financed by cuts in the british rebate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel 's country takes over the rotating eu presidency in january austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , who takes over the eu presidency from britain next month - and who will have to cope with the budget standoff if this week 's summit fails - said the bloc was moving slowly towards a deal .
" i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly , but i think we are moving in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe and not a divided europe , and i think everybody knows it , " he said . german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit since taking office , said : " we will do everything possible .
-lrb- we will -rrb- try our best ...
we can not say now if we will be able to come to an agreement . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso called on eu leaders thursday to hammer out a " credible " budget deal capable of funding the bloc 's expansion into eastern europe .

meanwhile , the germans have kept their expectations quiet . while germany 's new chancellor angela merkel watches britain and france bicker over rebates and agriculture spending during the crucial eu budgetary meetings in brussels on thursday and friday , there are some compromises she wo n't be willing to take back to berlin . one of germany 's foremost concerns will be limiting the size of the check it mails to the eu , according to peter becker of the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin . " one of the main interests will be that the german net-payer position should not increase excessively , " he said , adding that where the actual cuts are made is less important .
" the german government is relatively flexible in how they reach the goal . " curtailing payments to brussels bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants to keep more money at home , out of eu hands keeping the bill as low as possible has been germany 's aim since 2003 , when it led fellow net contributors in telling brussels to keep the budget to within 1 percent of the union 's gross national income .
the demand is the result of logical reasoning , according to roman maruhn of the center for applied policy research in munich . " there are calculations that show that no matter what political area the eu makes more money available to , it always costs the german government more than it receives , " he said .
" that is why germany is following a goal of keeping the eu budget down . " germany has long been europe 's biggest net contributor , and with the eu 's biggest economy , it was responsible for about 22 percent of 2004 's budget of 99.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- . protecting eastern germany during her first european financial negotiations , merkel will also aim to retain the funds brussels sends to structurally-weak areas of eastern germany , despite the addition of 10 , mostly poorer , member states who would otherwise receive the money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping eu money flowing to eastern germany is one of merkel 's goals " another goal for the germans in these negotiations is to make sure the eastern german states continue to receive the highest level of support from the structural funds without these funds being heavily reduced , " becker said . after spending last week talking to nearly half of the european union 's 25 heads of state , british prime minister tony blair , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of 2005 , brought out a new budget proposal wednesday that allocated more money to the structural and regional aid . berlin a bridge between paris and london the new framework , which increased spending to 849.3 billion euros , or 1.03 percent of gross national income , from the 847 billion that was widely-rejected last week , maintains the cherished british rebate and calls for review of the entire budget in 2009 , a measure paris rejects to prevent cuts to the 10 billion euros it receives from eu agriculture payouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has already visited chirac and blair " germany can build a bridge , " maruhn said .
" france is actively working against the british rebate , great britain is actively working against the common agriculture policy , and germany has a more moderate position in both points and is financially between great britain and france . " european commission president jose barroso agreed germany is in a position to help europe is best able to move forward when germany is active . " ' europe has always moved forward when germany has taken a mediating role , he said in an interview with germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper . but working to close the considerable gap along the english channel may not be enough .
poland , spain , lithuania and the netherlands have all voiced varying degrees of opposition to the draft , and the budget needs the unanimous support of all member states to be ratified . success far from certain eu leaders already failed to reach agreement on the budget in june , and while the politicians have said they want a compromise this week , no one expects them to make a bad deal simply for the sake of crossing it off their to-do list . the bloc , which has been reeling since french and dutch voters rejected the european constitution in june , is in dire need of a success story , even though failure would not be a complete disaster as a deal can still be agreed to next year . " the last time there were negotiations agreement was reached nine months before the finance framework went into effect , " maruhn said .
" now , with an aggravated starting point and considerably more eu partners , i have a bit of a problem seeing agreement coming sooner than occurred six years ago when there was less potential for conflict .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2005 eu finances : how do they work ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no time for lying around when it comes to dividing up europe 's money the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .
dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .
the new states , which have to detail how they would spend their money would also like to start planning where their funds will go . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what germany wants from the eu budget battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people could circumvent the rules by signing up with internet providers abroad but it has angered europe 's communications industry , mainly for the costs the measures will incur , and it was sure to worry people concerned about their right to privacy . " this agreement is a victory for democracy , a victory for our eu citizens , and a victory for the fundamental rights , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told members of the european parliament .
" this ... is a major step forward from a point of view of combating not only terrorism but also , and let me stress that , serious crime more generally . " industry sees measure as burden meanwhile , the eu 's electronic communications industry said it regretted the move and lamented that it did not take into account the internet world and its global nature . " this directive will impose a significant burden on the european e-communications industry , impacting on its competitiveness , " said five major european telecommunications organizations in a joint statement .
" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules . " beyond their economic consequences , far reaching data retention obligations may also undermine europeans ' confidence in new technologies , " the industry representatives added . reaction to london bombings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings made britain push for tighter telecommunication regulations spurred by the july 7 bombings in london , in which 56 people were killed on public transport , the british eu presidency has been trying to get agreement on telecoms records , biometric data and visa information . setting a virtually unprecedented time frame , britain has succeeded in fast-tracking the ambitious package through the parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of eu leaders in about three months . despite initial disagreement over the scope of the measures , the costs and who should pay them - companies or member states - and the duration of data retention , the deputies passed the measures by a clear majority . author wants name withdrawn before the assembly convened in strasbourg , the leaders of the main political groups had agreed to accept a series of late amendments compiled by eu justice ministers at the beginning of the month . the author of the report on which the measures were based , alexander nuno alvaro , a member of parliament for germany 's free-market liberal free democrats , was angered by the move and denounced what he said was " pressure " on the lawmakers . he also demanded that his name be withdrawn from the final text . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe adopts new counterterrorism strategy eu justice and interior ministers adopted on thursday a new counterterrorism strategy , as britain tried to push through tougher security legislation in the face of dogged opposition .

" i hope we will be able to reach an agreement , " said swedish prime minister goeran persson , but added : " i 'm not sure .
there are still many problems to solve . " estonian prime minister andrus ansip said the latest british compromise proposal , presented on the eve of the brussels summit , was an improvement but was still not there .
" the second proposal is better than the first one and it is a step forward in the right direction , but it is still a short step forward .
this proposal is not supporting -lrb- eu -rrb- enlargement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit in brussels runs through friday the budget , when finally agreed , will release much needed funds to the 10 new states which joined last year , many of them relatively poor former communist countries . slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda , a close political ally of blair among the ex-communist countries which joined the eu last year , was upbeat about prospects for a deal .
" this is a good basis for negotiations and a final compromise , " he said .
no promise of a deal luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , who failed to broker a budget agreement when he hosted an eu summit in june , warned that success was far from guaranteed this time .
" i am neither optimistic nor pessimistic , " he said .
" we need an agreement , but a lot of things need to happen for that .
we need to move closer to the british , and the british to us .
it may happen but it may not happen , " he said . denmark 's anders fogh rasmussen was more blunt .
" i think we need a new proposal in which there is improvements for the new members states , and it can be financed by cuts in the british rebate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel 's country takes over the rotating eu presidency in january austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , who takes over the eu presidency from britain next month - and who will have to cope with the budget standoff if this week 's summit fails - said the bloc was moving slowly towards a deal .
" i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly , but i think we are moving in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe and not a divided europe , and i think everybody knows it , " he said . german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit since taking office , said : " we will do everything possible .
-lrb- we will -rrb- try our best ...
we can not say now if we will be able to come to an agreement . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso called on eu leaders thursday to hammer out a " credible " budget deal capable of funding the bloc 's expansion into eastern europe .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people could circumvent the rules by signing up with internet providers abroad but it has angered europe 's communications industry , mainly for the costs the measures will incur , and it was sure to worry people concerned about their right to privacy . " this agreement is a victory for democracy , a victory for our eu citizens , and a victory for the fundamental rights , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told members of the european parliament .
" this ... is a major step forward from a point of view of combating not only terrorism but also , and let me stress that , serious crime more generally . " industry sees measure as burden meanwhile , the eu 's electronic communications industry said it regretted the move and lamented that it did not take into account the internet world and its global nature . " this directive will impose a significant burden on the european e-communications industry , impacting on its competitiveness , " said five major european telecommunications organizations in a joint statement .
" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules . " beyond their economic consequences , far reaching data retention obligations may also undermine europeans ' confidence in new technologies , " the industry representatives added . reaction to london bombings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings made britain push for tighter telecommunication regulations spurred by the july 7 bombings in london , in which 56 people were killed on public transport , the british eu presidency has been trying to get agreement on telecoms records , biometric data and visa information . setting a virtually unprecedented time frame , britain has succeeded in fast-tracking the ambitious package through the parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of eu leaders in about three months . despite initial disagreement over the scope of the measures , the costs and who should pay them - companies or member states - and the duration of data retention , the deputies passed the measures by a clear majority . author wants name withdrawn before the assembly convened in strasbourg , the leaders of the main political groups had agreed to accept a series of late amendments compiled by eu justice ministers at the beginning of the month . the author of the report on which the measures were based , alexander nuno alvaro , a member of parliament for germany 's free-market liberal free democrats , was angered by the move and denounced what he said was " pressure " on the lawmakers . he also demanded that his name be withdrawn from the final text . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe adopts new counterterrorism strategy eu justice and interior ministers adopted on thursday a new counterterrorism strategy , as britain tried to push through tougher security legislation in the face of dogged opposition .

dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .

" schröder crossed a line and discredited all of politics in the eyes of the people , " edmund stoiber , head christian social union , told the münchner merkur newspaper thursday . schröder supported by spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering put his support behind schröder though the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats did not want to take an official stand on the former german chancellor 's position , opposition leaders managed to earn enough votes to summon vice chancellor franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- to the plenary session . one of schröder 's closest confidents , müntefering said it was not up to the current administration to make judgments on what kinds of work former politicians should or should not accept .
he also said he was convinced schröder would act in germany 's best interest . " i 'm personally glad he did it , " müntefering said .
" it is a strategic project for all of europe . " earlier this week schröder defended his new post , calling it an honor to lead the project that would bring gas from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
the pipeline project is 51 percent owned by russia 's gazprom , while the german firms e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . social democratic head and former defense minister under schröder , peter struck , also said schröder 's participation in the project would be good for germany . opposition calls for about-face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline will deliver russian gas to germany leading free market liberal fdp parliamentarian wolfgang gerhardt , on the other hand , contended " it is not in germany 's interest " for schröder to take a position in a company " that is significantly run by the kremlin . " " german-russian relations are important , but they should n't be used to sweep under the carpet what the former chancellor is doing here , " gerhardt said .
" gerhard schröder has no regard for the principals that he represented with the active support of the social democrats . " christian democrat hermann gröhe also distanced himself from schröder 's decision , saying it " raised many questions . " members of the green party , which was the junior governing partner in schröder 's administration , and the left party , made up mainly of members of the former communist pds , appealed to schröder to change his mind and turn down the position . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : schröder undoing his own legacy by being willing to take over a leading role in the consortium for building the baltic sea pipeline , former chancellor schröder is doing a disservice to the german-russian relations , says dw-world 's ingo mannteufel .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people could circumvent the rules by signing up with internet providers abroad but it has angered europe 's communications industry , mainly for the costs the measures will incur , and it was sure to worry people concerned about their right to privacy . " this agreement is a victory for democracy , a victory for our eu citizens , and a victory for the fundamental rights , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told members of the european parliament .
" this ... is a major step forward from a point of view of combating not only terrorism but also , and let me stress that , serious crime more generally . " industry sees measure as burden meanwhile , the eu 's electronic communications industry said it regretted the move and lamented that it did not take into account the internet world and its global nature . " this directive will impose a significant burden on the european e-communications industry , impacting on its competitiveness , " said five major european telecommunications organizations in a joint statement .
" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 15.12.2005 the shadow of bird flu remains despite lack of publicity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany will allow poultry outside this week for the first time since october the threat to europe from bird flu made all the headlines in october but has since dropped down the news agenda .
but new outbreaks and continued emergency planning shows the possibility of a pandemic is still very real . budget problems , diplomatic spats with iran , trade arguments with the united states and , of course , the looming christmas holidays ; the pages of the european press are full of news telling the people that the continent has a lot on its plate this december . but thankfully there 's very little about bird flu .
there are fewer headlines about poultry culls on the front pages , rare reports on panic buying of the tamiflu vaccine and when the disease does find its way past stories about the top 10 toys to buy this christmas , it comes in the form of seemingly good news . on wednesday , germany announced that it was lifting its restrictions on keeping poultry shut inside because the season in which birds migrate from europe to warmer climes has ended .
germany 's friedrich löffler scientific institute , advisors to the german government on bird diseases , also reduced its risk assessment on the spread of the disease to germany to low from " high to moderate . " and it 's not just germany either .
austria , the netherlands and switzerland are among the other european countries which are now relaxing their regulations on poultry . europe can breathe a sigh of relief and join in a collective chorus of " that was a close one . " or can it ? ukrai n e a n d roma n ia a n n ou n ce n ew h5n1 outbreaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ukraine , 11 out of 25 quarantined villages have been confirmed as h5n1 outbreaks .
at the same time that germany announced it will allow chickens , ducks , geese , turkeys and pheasants to breed outdoors for the first time since being confined to sheds in mid-october , ukraine admitted that bird flu has been detected in 25 villages in the country 's crimea peninsula , 11 of which have confirmed outbreaks of the deadly h5n1 strain . nearly 54,000 birds had been rounded up and destroyed in the affected villages and 513 residents remain under medical observation .
president viktor yushchenko has invoked a state of emergency . meanwhile , four villages in southeast romania have been quarantined after the presence of an h5-subtype of bird flu was confirmed , suggesting that the virus was spreading outside the danube delta , where the deadly h5n1 virus has been confirmed in recent weeks . in areas of belarus , russia , kazakhstan and bulgaria import bans and culls continue .
bulgaria banned import and transit of poultry meat , eggs and live birds from ukraine while russia , which has its own h5n1 outbreaks to contend with , and kazakhstan imposed similar bans this month . huma n death toll rises i n the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far east continues to be the epicenter of bird flu outbreaks .
in the far east , where the most recent outbreaks originated from , the human death toll continues to rise .
indonesia confirmed its ninth human death from bird flu on tuesday , taking the global death toll from the disease to 71 , all in asia . in vietnam , a toddler who died on monday was suspected of having succumbed to the disease although doctors have ruled out the h5n1 virus as the cause despite large numbers of dead ducks being found near the child 's home in the city of can tho . while bird flu has dropped down the western european news agenda , governments on the continent are still hugely concerned about the threat of a flu pandemic among humans which could kill millions and cause massive economic losses . europe worki n g hard to protect a n d pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu announced that it would have sufficient plans and vaccines in place by 2007 .
france recently announced that confinement measures it enforced in october would be extended until the end of may .
spain 's agriculture ministry followed suit said it was extending measures imposed on nov .
30 through to may 31 .
germany said it will review its own situation before bird migration begins again next year . the european union is continuing to plan for a pandemic and announced this week that it would be prepared for such an event by 2007 . " over the next couple of months , i think europe will be much better off than any other continent to face a pandemic , " european commission director of public health fernand sauer told a news conference in stockholm on wednesday . " we are in a time of ' peace ' , and in a time of peace we have to prepare ... to mitigate the effects " of a pandemic , he said .
" at the end of 2007 , potentially we could cover between 20 and 25 percent of the european population ...
if -lrb- a pandemic -rrb- happens next week , there will be a shortage -lrb- of vaccines -rrb- but if it happens in 2007 , there will probably be enough , " he added . the much-publicized scare of october may have passed from europe 's public consciousness but the continent is far from delivering an " all-clear .

" germany has long been europe 's biggest net contributor , and with the eu 's biggest economy , it was responsible for about 22 percent of 2004 's budget of 99.7 billion euros -lrb- $ 120 billion -rrb- . protecting eastern germany during her first european financial negotiations , merkel will also aim to retain the funds brussels sends to structurally-weak areas of eastern germany , despite the addition of 10 , mostly poorer , member states who would otherwise receive the money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping eu money flowing to eastern germany is one of merkel 's goals " another goal for the germans in these negotiations is to make sure the eastern german states continue to receive the highest level of support from the structural funds without these funds being heavily reduced , " becker said . after spending last week talking to nearly half of the european union 's 25 heads of state , british prime minister tony blair , whose nation holds the rotating eu presidency until the end of 2005 , brought out a new budget proposal wednesday that allocated more money to the structural and regional aid . berlin a bridge between paris and london the new framework , which increased spending to 849.3 billion euros , or 1.03 percent of gross national income , from the 847 billion that was widely-rejected last week , maintains the cherished british rebate and calls for review of the entire budget in 2009 , a measure paris rejects to prevent cuts to the 10 billion euros it receives from eu agriculture payouts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has already visited chirac and blair " germany can build a bridge , " maruhn said .
" france is actively working against the british rebate , great britain is actively working against the common agriculture policy , and germany has a more moderate position in both points and is financially between great britain and france . " european commission president jose barroso agreed germany is in a position to help europe is best able to move forward when germany is active . " ' europe has always moved forward when germany has taken a mediating role , he said in an interview with germany 's bild am sonntag newspaper . but working to close the considerable gap along the english channel may not be enough .
poland , spain , lithuania and the netherlands have all voiced varying degrees of opposition to the draft , and the budget needs the unanimous support of all member states to be ratified . success far from certain eu leaders already failed to reach agreement on the budget in june , and while the politicians have said they want a compromise this week , no one expects them to make a bad deal simply for the sake of crossing it off their to-do list . the bloc , which has been reeling since french and dutch voters rejected the european constitution in june , is in dire need of a success story , even though failure would not be a complete disaster as a deal can still be agreed to next year . " the last time there were negotiations agreement was reached nine months before the finance framework went into effect , " maruhn said .
" now , with an aggravated starting point and considerably more eu partners , i have a bit of a problem seeing agreement coming sooner than occurred six years ago when there was less potential for conflict .

but new outbreaks and continued emergency planning shows the possibility of a pandemic is still very real . budget problems , diplomatic spats with iran , trade arguments with the united states and , of course , the looming christmas holidays ; the pages of the european press are full of news telling the people that the continent has a lot on its plate this december . but thankfully there 's very little about bird flu .
there are fewer headlines about poultry culls on the front pages , rare reports on panic buying of the tamiflu vaccine and when the disease does find its way past stories about the top 10 toys to buy this christmas , it comes in the form of seemingly good news . on wednesday , germany announced that it was lifting its restrictions on keeping poultry shut inside because the season in which birds migrate from europe to warmer climes has ended .
germany 's friedrich löffler scientific institute , advisors to the german government on bird diseases , also reduced its risk assessment on the spread of the disease to germany to low from " high to moderate . " and it 's not just germany either .
austria , the netherlands and switzerland are among the other european countries which are now relaxing their regulations on poultry . europe can breathe a sigh of relief and join in a collective chorus of " that was a close one . " or can it ? ukrai n e a n d roma n ia a n n ou n ce n ew h5n1 outbreaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ukraine , 11 out of 25 quarantined villages have been confirmed as h5n1 outbreaks .
at the same time that germany announced it will allow chickens , ducks , geese , turkeys and pheasants to breed outdoors for the first time since being confined to sheds in mid-october , ukraine admitted that bird flu has been detected in 25 villages in the country 's crimea peninsula , 11 of which have confirmed outbreaks of the deadly h5n1 strain . nearly 54,000 birds had been rounded up and destroyed in the affected villages and 513 residents remain under medical observation .
president viktor yushchenko has invoked a state of emergency . meanwhile , four villages in southeast romania have been quarantined after the presence of an h5-subtype of bird flu was confirmed , suggesting that the virus was spreading outside the danube delta , where the deadly h5n1 virus has been confirmed in recent weeks . in areas of belarus , russia , kazakhstan and bulgaria import bans and culls continue .
bulgaria banned import and transit of poultry meat , eggs and live birds from ukraine while russia , which has its own h5n1 outbreaks to contend with , and kazakhstan imposed similar bans this month . huma n death toll rises i n the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far east continues to be the epicenter of bird flu outbreaks .
in the far east , where the most recent outbreaks originated from , the human death toll continues to rise .
indonesia confirmed its ninth human death from bird flu on tuesday , taking the global death toll from the disease to 71 , all in asia . in vietnam , a toddler who died on monday was suspected of having succumbed to the disease although doctors have ruled out the h5n1 virus as the cause despite large numbers of dead ducks being found near the child 's home in the city of can tho . while bird flu has dropped down the western european news agenda , governments on the continent are still hugely concerned about the threat of a flu pandemic among humans which could kill millions and cause massive economic losses . europe worki n g hard to protect a n d pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu announced that it would have sufficient plans and vaccines in place by 2007 .
france recently announced that confinement measures it enforced in october would be extended until the end of may .
spain 's agriculture ministry followed suit said it was extending measures imposed on nov .
30 through to may 31 .
germany said it will review its own situation before bird migration begins again next year . the european union is continuing to plan for a pandemic and announced this week that it would be prepared for such an event by 2007 . " over the next couple of months , i think europe will be much better off than any other continent to face a pandemic , " european commission director of public health fernand sauer told a news conference in stockholm on wednesday . " we are in a time of ' peace ' , and in a time of peace we have to prepare ... to mitigate the effects " of a pandemic , he said .
" at the end of 2007 , potentially we could cover between 20 and 25 percent of the european population ...
if -lrb- a pandemic -rrb- happens next week , there will be a shortage -lrb- of vaccines -rrb- but if it happens in 2007 , there will probably be enough , " he added . the much-publicized scare of october may have passed from europe 's public consciousness but the continent is far from delivering an " all-clear .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .

" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .

" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .
more questions about the level of involvement of the german authorities in such cases have been raised by a detainee at the us military prison at guantanamo bay . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny involvement in cia affair during bundestag hearings on wednesday , the german government denied any involvement in the alleged cia abductions of suspected terrorists , but not all parliamentarians were convinced .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .

" schröder crossed a line and discredited all of politics in the eyes of the people , " edmund stoiber , head christian social union , told the münchner merkur newspaper thursday . schröder supported by spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering put his support behind schröder though the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats did not want to take an official stand on the former german chancellor 's position , opposition leaders managed to earn enough votes to summon vice chancellor franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- to the plenary session . one of schröder 's closest confidents , müntefering said it was not up to the current administration to make judgments on what kinds of work former politicians should or should not accept .
he also said he was convinced schröder would act in germany 's best interest . " i 'm personally glad he did it , " müntefering said .
" it is a strategic project for all of europe . " earlier this week schröder defended his new post , calling it an honor to lead the project that would bring gas from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
the pipeline project is 51 percent owned by russia 's gazprom , while the german firms e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . social democratic head and former defense minister under schröder , peter struck , also said schröder 's participation in the project would be good for germany . opposition calls for about-face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline will deliver russian gas to germany leading free market liberal fdp parliamentarian wolfgang gerhardt , on the other hand , contended " it is not in germany 's interest " for schröder to take a position in a company " that is significantly run by the kremlin . " " german-russian relations are important , but they should n't be used to sweep under the carpet what the former chancellor is doing here , " gerhardt said .
" gerhard schröder has no regard for the principals that he represented with the active support of the social democrats . " christian democrat hermann gröhe also distanced himself from schröder 's decision , saying it " raised many questions . " members of the green party , which was the junior governing partner in schröder 's administration , and the left party , made up mainly of members of the former communist pds , appealed to schröder to change his mind and turn down the position . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : schröder undoing his own legacy by being willing to take over a leading role in the consortium for building the baltic sea pipeline , former chancellor schröder is doing a disservice to the german-russian relations , says dw-world 's ingo mannteufel .

but new outbreaks and continued emergency planning shows the possibility of a pandemic is still very real . budget problems , diplomatic spats with iran , trade arguments with the united states and , of course , the looming christmas holidays ; the pages of the european press are full of news telling the people that the continent has a lot on its plate this december . but thankfully there 's very little about bird flu .
there are fewer headlines about poultry culls on the front pages , rare reports on panic buying of the tamiflu vaccine and when the disease does find its way past stories about the top 10 toys to buy this christmas , it comes in the form of seemingly good news . on wednesday , germany announced that it was lifting its restrictions on keeping poultry shut inside because the season in which birds migrate from europe to warmer climes has ended .
germany 's friedrich löffler scientific institute , advisors to the german government on bird diseases , also reduced its risk assessment on the spread of the disease to germany to low from " high to moderate . " and it 's not just germany either .
austria , the netherlands and switzerland are among the other european countries which are now relaxing their regulations on poultry . europe can breathe a sigh of relief and join in a collective chorus of " that was a close one . " or can it ? ukrai n e a n d roma n ia a n n ou n ce n ew h5n1 outbreaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ukraine , 11 out of 25 quarantined villages have been confirmed as h5n1 outbreaks .
at the same time that germany announced it will allow chickens , ducks , geese , turkeys and pheasants to breed outdoors for the first time since being confined to sheds in mid-october , ukraine admitted that bird flu has been detected in 25 villages in the country 's crimea peninsula , 11 of which have confirmed outbreaks of the deadly h5n1 strain . nearly 54,000 birds had been rounded up and destroyed in the affected villages and 513 residents remain under medical observation .
president viktor yushchenko has invoked a state of emergency . meanwhile , four villages in southeast romania have been quarantined after the presence of an h5-subtype of bird flu was confirmed , suggesting that the virus was spreading outside the danube delta , where the deadly h5n1 virus has been confirmed in recent weeks . in areas of belarus , russia , kazakhstan and bulgaria import bans and culls continue .
bulgaria banned import and transit of poultry meat , eggs and live birds from ukraine while russia , which has its own h5n1 outbreaks to contend with , and kazakhstan imposed similar bans this month . huma n death toll rises i n the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far east continues to be the epicenter of bird flu outbreaks .
in the far east , where the most recent outbreaks originated from , the human death toll continues to rise .
indonesia confirmed its ninth human death from bird flu on tuesday , taking the global death toll from the disease to 71 , all in asia . in vietnam , a toddler who died on monday was suspected of having succumbed to the disease although doctors have ruled out the h5n1 virus as the cause despite large numbers of dead ducks being found near the child 's home in the city of can tho . while bird flu has dropped down the western european news agenda , governments on the continent are still hugely concerned about the threat of a flu pandemic among humans which could kill millions and cause massive economic losses . europe worki n g hard to protect a n d pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu announced that it would have sufficient plans and vaccines in place by 2007 .
france recently announced that confinement measures it enforced in october would be extended until the end of may .
spain 's agriculture ministry followed suit said it was extending measures imposed on nov .
30 through to may 31 .
germany said it will review its own situation before bird migration begins again next year . the european union is continuing to plan for a pandemic and announced this week that it would be prepared for such an event by 2007 . " over the next couple of months , i think europe will be much better off than any other continent to face a pandemic , " european commission director of public health fernand sauer told a news conference in stockholm on wednesday . " we are in a time of ' peace ' , and in a time of peace we have to prepare ... to mitigate the effects " of a pandemic , he said .
" at the end of 2007 , potentially we could cover between 20 and 25 percent of the european population ...
if -lrb- a pandemic -rrb- happens next week , there will be a shortage -lrb- of vaccines -rrb- but if it happens in 2007 , there will probably be enough , " he added . the much-publicized scare of october may have passed from europe 's public consciousness but the continent is far from delivering an " all-clear .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .

" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

" schröder crossed a line and discredited all of politics in the eyes of the people , " edmund stoiber , head christian social union , told the münchner merkur newspaper thursday . schröder supported by spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering put his support behind schröder though the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats did not want to take an official stand on the former german chancellor 's position , opposition leaders managed to earn enough votes to summon vice chancellor franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- to the plenary session . one of schröder 's closest confidents , müntefering said it was not up to the current administration to make judgments on what kinds of work former politicians should or should not accept .
he also said he was convinced schröder would act in germany 's best interest . " i 'm personally glad he did it , " müntefering said .
" it is a strategic project for all of europe . " earlier this week schröder defended his new post , calling it an honor to lead the project that would bring gas from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
the pipeline project is 51 percent owned by russia 's gazprom , while the german firms e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . social democratic head and former defense minister under schröder , peter struck , also said schröder 's participation in the project would be good for germany . opposition calls for about-face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline will deliver russian gas to germany leading free market liberal fdp parliamentarian wolfgang gerhardt , on the other hand , contended " it is not in germany 's interest " for schröder to take a position in a company " that is significantly run by the kremlin . " " german-russian relations are important , but they should n't be used to sweep under the carpet what the former chancellor is doing here , " gerhardt said .
" gerhard schröder has no regard for the principals that he represented with the active support of the social democrats . " christian democrat hermann gröhe also distanced himself from schröder 's decision , saying it " raised many questions . " members of the green party , which was the junior governing partner in schröder 's administration , and the left party , made up mainly of members of the former communist pds , appealed to schröder to change his mind and turn down the position . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : schröder undoing his own legacy by being willing to take over a leading role in the consortium for building the baltic sea pipeline , former chancellor schröder is doing a disservice to the german-russian relations , says dw-world 's ingo mannteufel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2005 eu finances : how do they work ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no time for lying around when it comes to dividing up europe 's money the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .
dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ?

dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .
the new states , which have to detail how they would spend their money would also like to start planning where their funds will go . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what germany wants from the eu budget battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .

" i hope we will be able to reach an agreement , " said swedish prime minister goeran persson , but added : " i 'm not sure .
there are still many problems to solve . " estonian prime minister andrus ansip said the latest british compromise proposal , presented on the eve of the brussels summit , was an improvement but was still not there .

we need to move closer to the british , and the british to us .
it may happen but it may not happen , " he said . denmark 's anders fogh rasmussen was more blunt .

" i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly , but i think we are moving in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe and not a divided europe , and i think everybody knows it , " he said . german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit since taking office , said : " we will do everything possible .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people could circumvent the rules by signing up with internet providers abroad but it has angered europe 's communications industry , mainly for the costs the measures will incur , and it was sure to worry people concerned about their right to privacy . " this agreement is a victory for democracy , a victory for our eu citizens , and a victory for the fundamental rights , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told members of the european parliament .
" this ... is a major step forward from a point of view of combating not only terrorism but also , and let me stress that , serious crime more generally . " industry sees measure as burden meanwhile , the eu 's electronic communications industry said it regretted the move and lamented that it did not take into account the internet world and its global nature . " this directive will impose a significant burden on the european e-communications industry , impacting on its competitiveness , " said five major european telecommunications organizations in a joint statement .
" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules . " beyond their economic consequences , far reaching data retention obligations may also undermine europeans ' confidence in new technologies , " the industry representatives added . reaction to london bombings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings made britain push for tighter telecommunication regulations spurred by the july 7 bombings in london , in which 56 people were killed on public transport , the british eu presidency has been trying to get agreement on telecoms records , biometric data and visa information . setting a virtually unprecedented time frame , britain has succeeded in fast-tracking the ambitious package through the parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of eu leaders in about three months . despite initial disagreement over the scope of the measures , the costs and who should pay them - companies or member states - and the duration of data retention , the deputies passed the measures by a clear majority . author wants name withdrawn before the assembly convened in strasbourg , the leaders of the main political groups had agreed to accept a series of late amendments compiled by eu justice ministers at the beginning of the month . the author of the report on which the measures were based , alexander nuno alvaro , a member of parliament for germany 's free-market liberal free democrats , was angered by the move and denounced what he said was " pressure " on the lawmakers . he also demanded that his name be withdrawn from the final text . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe adopts new counterterrorism strategy eu justice and interior ministers adopted on thursday a new counterterrorism strategy , as britain tried to push through tougher security legislation in the face of dogged opposition .

dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people could circumvent the rules by signing up with internet providers abroad but it has angered europe 's communications industry , mainly for the costs the measures will incur , and it was sure to worry people concerned about their right to privacy . " this agreement is a victory for democracy , a victory for our eu citizens , and a victory for the fundamental rights , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told members of the european parliament .
" this ... is a major step forward from a point of view of combating not only terrorism but also , and let me stress that , serious crime more generally . " industry sees measure as burden meanwhile , the eu 's electronic communications industry said it regretted the move and lamented that it did not take into account the internet world and its global nature . " this directive will impose a significant burden on the european e-communications industry , impacting on its competitiveness , " said five major european telecommunications organizations in a joint statement .
" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules . " beyond their economic consequences , far reaching data retention obligations may also undermine europeans ' confidence in new technologies , " the industry representatives added . reaction to london bombings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings made britain push for tighter telecommunication regulations spurred by the july 7 bombings in london , in which 56 people were killed on public transport , the british eu presidency has been trying to get agreement on telecoms records , biometric data and visa information . setting a virtually unprecedented time frame , britain has succeeded in fast-tracking the ambitious package through the parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of eu leaders in about three months . despite initial disagreement over the scope of the measures , the costs and who should pay them - companies or member states - and the duration of data retention , the deputies passed the measures by a clear majority . author wants name withdrawn before the assembly convened in strasbourg , the leaders of the main political groups had agreed to accept a series of late amendments compiled by eu justice ministers at the beginning of the month . the author of the report on which the measures were based , alexander nuno alvaro , a member of parliament for germany 's free-market liberal free democrats , was angered by the move and denounced what he said was " pressure " on the lawmakers . he also demanded that his name be withdrawn from the final text . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe adopts new counterterrorism strategy eu justice and interior ministers adopted on thursday a new counterterrorism strategy , as britain tried to push through tougher security legislation in the face of dogged opposition .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.12.2005 promoting germany 's young scientists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german researchers could be looking at a bright future this month marks 40 years since the birth of germany 's young researchers competition .
" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2005 eu finances : how do they work ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no time for lying around when it comes to dividing up europe 's money the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .
dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.12.2005 eu finances : how do they work ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no time for lying around when it comes to dividing up europe 's money the eu manages to spend about 100 billion euros a year but is n't able to levy and direct taxes .
dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .
the new states , which have to detail how they would spend their money would also like to start planning where their funds will go . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what germany wants from the eu budget battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .

" i hope we will be able to reach an agreement , " said swedish prime minister goeran persson , but added : " i 'm not sure .
there are still many problems to solve . " estonian prime minister andrus ansip said the latest british compromise proposal , presented on the eve of the brussels summit , was an improvement but was still not there .
" the second proposal is better than the first one and it is a step forward in the right direction , but it is still a short step forward .
this proposal is not supporting -lrb- eu -rrb- enlargement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit in brussels runs through friday the budget , when finally agreed , will release much needed funds to the 10 new states which joined last year , many of them relatively poor former communist countries . slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda , a close political ally of blair among the ex-communist countries which joined the eu last year , was upbeat about prospects for a deal .
" this is a good basis for negotiations and a final compromise , " he said .
no promise of a deal luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , who failed to broker a budget agreement when he hosted an eu summit in june , warned that success was far from guaranteed this time .
" i am neither optimistic nor pessimistic , " he said .
" we need an agreement , but a lot of things need to happen for that .
we need to move closer to the british , and the british to us .
it may happen but it may not happen , " he said . denmark 's anders fogh rasmussen was more blunt .
" i think we need a new proposal in which there is improvements for the new members states , and it can be financed by cuts in the british rebate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel 's country takes over the rotating eu presidency in january austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , who takes over the eu presidency from britain next month - and who will have to cope with the budget standoff if this week 's summit fails - said the bloc was moving slowly towards a deal .
" i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly , but i think we are moving in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe and not a divided europe , and i think everybody knows it , " he said . german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit since taking office , said : " we will do everything possible .
-lrb- we will -rrb- try our best ...
we can not say now if we will be able to come to an agreement . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso called on eu leaders thursday to hammer out a " credible " budget deal capable of funding the bloc 's expansion into eastern europe .
" it is about coherence and credibility .
are we credible when we say that we want an enlarged europe to work ?

dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .

dw-world explains where its money comes from , and what eu members are arguing over . where does the europea n u n io n get its mo n ey ? a system is set up so that the 25 eu member states contribute to the budget roughly in proportion to their economic size .
as the largest of the bloc 's economies , germany contributes most and paid about 8.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 10.2 billion -rrb- more into eu coffers than it received back in 2004 .
the netherlands and sweden contribute the largest proportion of their gross national income to the union .
spain , which received nearly eight billion euros , got the biggest check from brussels last year , followed by greece 's 4.1 billion euros . a portion of the eu 's income also comes from duties it places on agricultural and manufactured goods . what is the " fi n a n cial perspective ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coming to a financial agreement is a delicate process the financial perspective is a rundown of how the european union will spend the money it receives from member states and encompasses seven years worth of spending . european leaders are currently meeting to debate how money will be spent from 2007 to 2013 .
the union still has to agree on annual budgets , which set the precise spending levels , but it helps to have general boundaries settled ahead of time . the financial perspective divides the money into six categories : sustainable growth ; preservation and management of natural resources ; citizenship , freedom , security and justice ; the eu as a global player ; administration ; and compensation . how much does the eu pla n to spe n d ? great britain , which holds the rotating eu presidency during the financial negotiations , suggested a budget of 849.3 billion euros , equal to 1.03 percent of the union 's gross national income and 175.7 billion euros less than the european commission requested . most of the money will go to aid to farmers and rural development -lrb- 46 percent -rrb- and on aid to poorer regions -lrb- 30 percent -rrb- . what cha n ges did great britai n suggest ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair 's latest proposal did n't find many supporters regio n al developme n t fu n ds : the british proposal calls for trimming regional funds for the 10 new eu members by 150 billion euros , leaving 296 billion euros for seven years worth of improvements to infrastructure networks and environmental protection projects . the british rebate : negotiated by margaret thatcher in 1984 , the british rebate provides great britain with a refund of 66 percent of its net contribution because the uk had relatively few farms and was penalized for raising more money from its value-added tax than other member states . opponents , especially the french , say the rebate is no longer in tune with british prosperity and an expanded eu .
they want to see the refund cut , a step the britain refuses to make without reforms to the union 's common agriculture policy , which pays france about 10 billon euros a year in farm subsidies . fi n a n cial review : according to the most recent financial perspective , the european commission would be called on to assess all european income and expenditures , including its agriculture policy and the british rebate , in 2009 to prepare for the 2014 budget . how importa n t is reachi n g agreeme n t ? though reaching a consensus would be beneficial for the union , which is desperately seeking a success story after a year that saw the european constitution abandoned and attempts to reform the service sector fail , this is n't the last chance eu members will have to reach an agreement . it is the 10 new member states that will be pushing hardest for a deal since the longer a budget takes , the less tends to dole out .
the new states , which have to detail how they would spend their money would also like to start planning where their funds will go . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de what germany wants from the eu budget battle lines have been drawn between the french , who want to protect agriculture subsidies , and the british , who are looking to keep their eu rebate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 15.12.2005 promoting germany 's young scientists großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : young german researchers could be looking at a bright future this month marks 40 years since the birth of germany 's young researchers competition .
" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people could circumvent the rules by signing up with internet providers abroad but it has angered europe 's communications industry , mainly for the costs the measures will incur , and it was sure to worry people concerned about their right to privacy .

" i hope we will be able to reach an agreement , " said swedish prime minister goeran persson , but added : " i 'm not sure .
there are still many problems to solve . " estonian prime minister andrus ansip said the latest british compromise proposal , presented on the eve of the brussels summit , was an improvement but was still not there .
" the second proposal is better than the first one and it is a step forward in the right direction , but it is still a short step forward .
this proposal is not supporting -lrb- eu -rrb- enlargement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit in brussels runs through friday the budget , when finally agreed , will release much needed funds to the 10 new states which joined last year , many of them relatively poor former communist countries . slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda , a close political ally of blair among the ex-communist countries which joined the eu last year , was upbeat about prospects for a deal .
" this is a good basis for negotiations and a final compromise , " he said .
no promise of a deal luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , who failed to broker a budget agreement when he hosted an eu summit in june , warned that success was far from guaranteed this time .
" i am neither optimistic nor pessimistic , " he said .
" we need an agreement , but a lot of things need to happen for that .
we need to move closer to the british , and the british to us .
it may happen but it may not happen , " he said . denmark 's anders fogh rasmussen was more blunt .
" i think we need a new proposal in which there is improvements for the new members states , and it can be financed by cuts in the british rebate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel 's country takes over the rotating eu presidency in january austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , who takes over the eu presidency from britain next month - and who will have to cope with the budget standoff if this week 's summit fails - said the bloc was moving slowly towards a deal .
" i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly , but i think we are moving in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe and not a divided europe , and i think everybody knows it , " he said . german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit since taking office , said : " we will do everything possible .
-lrb- we will -rrb- try our best ...
we can not say now if we will be able to come to an agreement . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso called on eu leaders thursday to hammer out a " credible " budget deal capable of funding the bloc 's expansion into eastern europe .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people could circumvent the rules by signing up with internet providers abroad but it has angered europe 's communications industry , mainly for the costs the measures will incur , and it was sure to worry people concerned about their right to privacy . " this agreement is a victory for democracy , a victory for our eu citizens , and a victory for the fundamental rights , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told members of the european parliament .
" this ... is a major step forward from a point of view of combating not only terrorism but also , and let me stress that , serious crime more generally . " industry sees measure as burden meanwhile , the eu 's electronic communications industry said it regretted the move and lamented that it did not take into account the internet world and its global nature . " this directive will impose a significant burden on the european e-communications industry , impacting on its competitiveness , " said five major european telecommunications organizations in a joint statement .
" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules . " beyond their economic consequences , far reaching data retention obligations may also undermine europeans ' confidence in new technologies , " the industry representatives added . reaction to london bombings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings made britain push for tighter telecommunication regulations spurred by the july 7 bombings in london , in which 56 people were killed on public transport , the british eu presidency has been trying to get agreement on telecoms records , biometric data and visa information . setting a virtually unprecedented time frame , britain has succeeded in fast-tracking the ambitious package through the parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of eu leaders in about three months . despite initial disagreement over the scope of the measures , the costs and who should pay them - companies or member states - and the duration of data retention , the deputies passed the measures by a clear majority . author wants name withdrawn before the assembly convened in strasbourg , the leaders of the main political groups had agreed to accept a series of late amendments compiled by eu justice ministers at the beginning of the month . the author of the report on which the measures were based , alexander nuno alvaro , a member of parliament for germany 's free-market liberal free democrats , was angered by the move and denounced what he said was " pressure " on the lawmakers . he also demanded that his name be withdrawn from the final text . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe adopts new counterterrorism strategy eu justice and interior ministers adopted on thursday a new counterterrorism strategy , as britain tried to push through tougher security legislation in the face of dogged opposition .

" i hope we will be able to reach an agreement , " said swedish prime minister goeran persson , but added : " i 'm not sure .
there are still many problems to solve . " estonian prime minister andrus ansip said the latest british compromise proposal , presented on the eve of the brussels summit , was an improvement but was still not there .
" the second proposal is better than the first one and it is a step forward in the right direction , but it is still a short step forward .
this proposal is not supporting -lrb- eu -rrb- enlargement , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu summit in brussels runs through friday the budget , when finally agreed , will release much needed funds to the 10 new states which joined last year , many of them relatively poor former communist countries . slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda , a close political ally of blair among the ex-communist countries which joined the eu last year , was upbeat about prospects for a deal .
" this is a good basis for negotiations and a final compromise , " he said .
no promise of a deal luxembourg 's jean-claude juncker , who failed to broker a budget agreement when he hosted an eu summit in june , warned that success was far from guaranteed this time .
" i am neither optimistic nor pessimistic , " he said .
" we need an agreement , but a lot of things need to happen for that .
we need to move closer to the british , and the british to us .
it may happen but it may not happen , " he said . denmark 's anders fogh rasmussen was more blunt .
" i think we need a new proposal in which there is improvements for the new members states , and it can be financed by cuts in the british rebate , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schüssel 's country takes over the rotating eu presidency in january austrian chancellor wolfgang schüssel , who takes over the eu presidency from britain next month - and who will have to cope with the budget standoff if this week 's summit fails - said the bloc was moving slowly towards a deal .
" i have the impression that we are moving , gradually , maybe slowly , but i think we are moving in the right direction .
what we need now is a united europe and not a divided europe , and i think everybody knows it , " he said . german chancellor angela merkel , attending her first eu summit since taking office , said : " we will do everything possible .
-lrb- we will -rrb- try our best ...
we can not say now if we will be able to come to an agreement . " european commission chief jose manuel barroso called on eu leaders thursday to hammer out a " credible " budget deal capable of funding the bloc 's expansion into eastern europe .
" it is about coherence and credibility .
are we credible when we say that we want an enlarged europe to work ?

editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react . berlin 's der tagesspiegel called the outrage at ahmadinejad 's accusation that the holocaust was a " myth " justified and added that no one should be surprised by his comments anymore since the teheran has made no secret of it hatred for the west .
" his rhetoric is consistent with the iranian revolution , " the paper wrote .
" the destruction of israel is the mullah regime 's stated goal , and newspaper classifieds have advertised for potential suicide bombers who would be willing to blow up israeli or american targets for some time . " alarmed that ahmadinejad could be lighting a match in the middle east powder keg , another berlin paper , the taz , said there are two reasons to take ahmadinejad seriously .
" first , his words are falling on fertile ground in the islamic countries and adding fuel to the hatred of the west and israel , " the paper editorialized .
" second , the usa and israel , who already have prepared plans to attack iran , could see this as a welcome pretense to put them into action . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many in germany are nervous too many people are interested in hearing ahmadinejad a different tack was taken by süddeutsche zeitu n g .
the munich daily remarked that the ahmadinejad 's " continued provocations scream for a response , " and pondered how the west should react .
european leaders have to be prepared for confrontation , the paper wrote , and " make it clear to ahmadinejad that there are consequences to his populist campaign . "
however , too strict of a reaction could be equally dangerous .
" if the west reacts excessively - excluding iran from the world cup would be like a national tragedy - there is the danger of escalation with uncontrollable consequences for the nuclear talks . " diplomatic messages would n't be enough , according to the leipziger volkszeitu n g .
" deep outrage , the sharpest disapproval and international condemnation alone will not put an end to this rubbish , " the paper wrote .
but it too cautioned against barring iran from the world cup as the " least useful " way to achieve any result .
" the olympic boycotts in moscow and los angeles showed diplomacy 's helpless when it applies the thumbscrews where they will politically and economically hurt the least , " the paper concluded . the neue presse from hanover commented that ahmadinejad 's words would bring the world around to the position from which israel has never wavered .
" israel has a right to feel threatened by the persian potentate , " the paper wrote .
" tel aviv has never left a doubt that it would pay any price , including military attacks , to prevent iran from having atomic weapons thanks to ahmadinejad , israel can expect world-wide understanding for the time being . " the fra n kfurter allgemei n e zeitu n g took time to analyze the background of ahmadinejad 's anti-israeli comments .
" iran has always worked to be recognized as an actor that follows criteria of -lrb- western -rrb- reason , " the paper pointed out .
" that became clear during the argument with america and europe over the iranian nuclear program when teheran insisted on its right to peaceful atomic technology . "
the paper then wondered why ahmadinejad would provoke an argument with such " baiting " unless " he already feels so safe and close to developing a bomb " that he can afford to strengthen the west 's argument against giving him nuclear technology . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany calls in iranian diplomat over president 's remarks the german government called in an iranian diplomat to protest against iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's verbal attacks on israel , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday .

but new outbreaks and continued emergency planning shows the possibility of a pandemic is still very real . budget problems , diplomatic spats with iran , trade arguments with the united states and , of course , the looming christmas holidays ; the pages of the european press are full of news telling the people that the continent has a lot on its plate this december . but thankfully there 's very little about bird flu .
there are fewer headlines about poultry culls on the front pages , rare reports on panic buying of the tamiflu vaccine and when the disease does find its way past stories about the top 10 toys to buy this christmas , it comes in the form of seemingly good news . on wednesday , germany announced that it was lifting its restrictions on keeping poultry shut inside because the season in which birds migrate from europe to warmer climes has ended .
germany 's friedrich löffler scientific institute , advisors to the german government on bird diseases , also reduced its risk assessment on the spread of the disease to germany to low from " high to moderate . " and it 's not just germany either .
austria , the netherlands and switzerland are among the other european countries which are now relaxing their regulations on poultry . europe can breathe a sigh of relief and join in a collective chorus of " that was a close one . " or can it ? ukrai n e a n d roma n ia a n n ou n ce n ew h5n1 outbreaks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in ukraine , 11 out of 25 quarantined villages have been confirmed as h5n1 outbreaks .
at the same time that germany announced it will allow chickens , ducks , geese , turkeys and pheasants to breed outdoors for the first time since being confined to sheds in mid-october , ukraine admitted that bird flu has been detected in 25 villages in the country 's crimea peninsula , 11 of which have confirmed outbreaks of the deadly h5n1 strain . nearly 54,000 birds had been rounded up and destroyed in the affected villages and 513 residents remain under medical observation .
president viktor yushchenko has invoked a state of emergency . meanwhile , four villages in southeast romania have been quarantined after the presence of an h5-subtype of bird flu was confirmed , suggesting that the virus was spreading outside the danube delta , where the deadly h5n1 virus has been confirmed in recent weeks . in areas of belarus , russia , kazakhstan and bulgaria import bans and culls continue .
bulgaria banned import and transit of poultry meat , eggs and live birds from ukraine while russia , which has its own h5n1 outbreaks to contend with , and kazakhstan imposed similar bans this month . huma n death toll rises i n the far east bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the far east continues to be the epicenter of bird flu outbreaks .
in the far east , where the most recent outbreaks originated from , the human death toll continues to rise .
indonesia confirmed its ninth human death from bird flu on tuesday , taking the global death toll from the disease to 71 , all in asia . in vietnam , a toddler who died on monday was suspected of having succumbed to the disease although doctors have ruled out the h5n1 virus as the cause despite large numbers of dead ducks being found near the child 's home in the city of can tho . while bird flu has dropped down the western european news agenda , governments on the continent are still hugely concerned about the threat of a flu pandemic among humans which could kill millions and cause massive economic losses . europe worki n g hard to protect a n d pla n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu announced that it would have sufficient plans and vaccines in place by 2007 .
france recently announced that confinement measures it enforced in october would be extended until the end of may .
spain 's agriculture ministry followed suit said it was extending measures imposed on nov .
30 through to may 31 .
germany said it will review its own situation before bird migration begins again next year . the european union is continuing to plan for a pandemic and announced this week that it would be prepared for such an event by 2007 . " over the next couple of months , i think europe will be much better off than any other continent to face a pandemic , " european commission director of public health fernand sauer told a news conference in stockholm on wednesday . " we are in a time of ' peace ' , and in a time of peace we have to prepare ... to mitigate the effects " of a pandemic , he said .
" at the end of 2007 , potentially we could cover between 20 and 25 percent of the european population ...
if -lrb- a pandemic -rrb- happens next week , there will be a shortage -lrb- of vaccines -rrb- but if it happens in 2007 , there will probably be enough , " he added . the much-publicized scare of october may have passed from europe 's public consciousness but the continent is far from delivering an " all-clear .

" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

" schröder crossed a line and discredited all of politics in the eyes of the people , " edmund stoiber , head christian social union , told the münchner merkur newspaper thursday . schröder supported by spd bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : müntefering put his support behind schröder though the grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats did not want to take an official stand on the former german chancellor 's position , opposition leaders managed to earn enough votes to summon vice chancellor franz müntefering -lrb- photo -rrb- to the plenary session . one of schröder 's closest confidents , müntefering said it was not up to the current administration to make judgments on what kinds of work former politicians should or should not accept .
he also said he was convinced schröder would act in germany 's best interest . " i 'm personally glad he did it , " müntefering said .
" it is a strategic project for all of europe . " earlier this week schröder defended his new post , calling it an honor to lead the project that would bring gas from russia to germany under the baltic sea .
the pipeline project is 51 percent owned by russia 's gazprom , while the german firms e.on and basf hold 24.5 percent each through their gas units . social democratic head and former defense minister under schröder , peter struck , also said schröder 's participation in the project would be good for germany . opposition calls for about-face bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pipeline will deliver russian gas to germany leading free market liberal fdp parliamentarian wolfgang gerhardt , on the other hand , contended " it is not in germany 's interest " for schröder to take a position in a company " that is significantly run by the kremlin . " " german-russian relations are important , but they should n't be used to sweep under the carpet what the former chancellor is doing here , " gerhardt said .
" gerhard schröder has no regard for the principals that he represented with the active support of the social democrats . " christian democrat hermann gröhe also distanced himself from schröder 's decision , saying it " raised many questions . " members of the green party , which was the junior governing partner in schröder 's administration , and the left party , made up mainly of members of the former communist pds , appealed to schröder to change his mind and turn down the position . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : schröder undoing his own legacy by being willing to take over a leading role in the consortium for building the baltic sea pipeline , former chancellor schröder is doing a disservice to the german-russian relations , says dw-world 's ingo mannteufel .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .

" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules . " beyond their economic consequences , far reaching data retention obligations may also undermine europeans ' confidence in new technologies , " the industry representatives added . reaction to london bombings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings made britain push for tighter telecommunication regulations spurred by the july 7 bombings in london , in which 56 people were killed on public transport , the british eu presidency has been trying to get agreement on telecoms records , biometric data and visa information . setting a virtually unprecedented time frame , britain has succeeded in fast-tracking the ambitious package through the parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of eu leaders in about three months . despite initial disagreement over the scope of the measures , the costs and who should pay them - companies or member states - and the duration of data retention , the deputies passed the measures by a clear majority . author wants name withdrawn before the assembly convened in strasbourg , the leaders of the main political groups had agreed to accept a series of late amendments compiled by eu justice ministers at the beginning of the month . the author of the report on which the measures were based , alexander nuno alvaro , a member of parliament for germany 's free-market liberal free democrats , was angered by the move and denounced what he said was " pressure " on the lawmakers . he also demanded that his name be withdrawn from the final text . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe adopts new counterterrorism strategy eu justice and interior ministers adopted on thursday a new counterterrorism strategy , as britain tried to push through tougher security legislation in the face of dogged opposition .

" it 's important in this european parliament that we get to the root of the matter , " said hannes swoboda , vice president of the socialist group in the assembly . " we must investigate without prejudice but without being blind to the possibilities .
we want to know the truth , nothing more than the truth .
if we do this then we are genuinely battling against terrorism but also against torture , " he added . british prime minister tony blair on wednesday dismissed as " completely absurd " calls to probe all us government plane movements through britain in the wake of the cia " extraordinary rendition " row . blair said there were a " whole series of reasons " why washington requested stops at british airports and restated his government 's opposition to torture and lack of knowledge about so-called " extraordinary rendition " flights . cou n cil of europe discovers credible i n formatio n bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the council of europe is investigating possible european involvement in " extraordinary rendition " however , the council of europe probe concluded that " the information gathered to date reinforced the credibility of the allegations concerning the transport and temporary detention of detainees - outside all judicial procedure - in european countries . " it said that some european governments may have colluded . dick marty , the swiss parliamentarian leading the inquiry , said the fact that us secretary of state condoleezza rice had failed to categorically deny that detainees were transported or held in europe substantiated the claims . the council 's findings will intensify pressure on the united states to explain its policy on terror suspects . eu states ope n ow n i n vestigatio n s i n to cia missio n s bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as well as eu level investigations , member states are instigating their own meanwhile warsaw promised to fast-track its own probe into whether poland housed the us intelligence agency 's main european base for interrogating terror suspects . the swiss parliament has also opened an inquiry into flights over the tiny landlocked nation by cia-chartered aircraft thought to be carrying suspected terrorists , a parliamentary commission said in a statement wednesday . over the next few weeks , the commission is to probe how much the government knew about the flights , what steps it took and the level of swiss intelligence involvement . turkey on sunday denied the united states ' cia spy agency interrogated suspected terrorists on turkish soil . germa n detai n ee i n vestigatio n co n ti n ues with de n ials bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier -lrb- l . -rrb- and chancellor merkel feel the pressure in germany , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said that german authorities played no role in the abduction of a german man of lebanese descent seized in macedonia and held for five months in afghanistan . the case of khaled el masri has fuelled the controversy over the alleged secret prisons run by the cia and prisoner flights through europe . steinmeier told parliament that the german authorities were only informed of masri 's abduction in june 2004 , after he had been released in albania by his captors . masri last week filed a lawsuit against the cia in a us federal court , alleging that he was wrongfully abducted and abused as a prisoner . masri has also stated that he was questioned by germans while being held in afghanistan .

eu states with longer retention periods in place would be allowed to keep them . the laws would apply to land telephone lines and mobile phones , text messages and internet protocols .
no record of the conversation or message itself would be kept . eu countries would have the option of keeping information about unanswered calls , details of which proved decisive in the probe into the madrid train bombings last year . the vote is a major success for britain , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , as it had pledged to try to force the measures through all the bloc 's institutions before its mandate ends on dec .
31 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people could circumvent the rules by signing up with internet providers abroad but it has angered europe 's communications industry , mainly for the costs the measures will incur , and it was sure to worry people concerned about their right to privacy . " this agreement is a victory for democracy , a victory for our eu citizens , and a victory for the fundamental rights , " eu justice commissioner franco frattini told members of the european parliament .
" this ... is a major step forward from a point of view of combating not only terrorism but also , and let me stress that , serious crime more generally . " industry sees measure as burden meanwhile , the eu 's electronic communications industry said it regretted the move and lamented that it did not take into account the internet world and its global nature . " this directive will impose a significant burden on the european e-communications industry , impacting on its competitiveness , " said five major european telecommunications organizations in a joint statement .
" however only a fraction of the e-mail services used today would be covered by the eu directive as the world largest e-mail providers are not in europe , allowing criminals to easily circumvent the rules . " beyond their economic consequences , far reaching data retention obligations may also undermine europeans ' confidence in new technologies , " the industry representatives added . reaction to london bombings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the london bombings made britain push for tighter telecommunication regulations spurred by the july 7 bombings in london , in which 56 people were killed on public transport , the british eu presidency has been trying to get agreement on telecoms records , biometric data and visa information . setting a virtually unprecedented time frame , britain has succeeded in fast-tracking the ambitious package through the parliament , the eu 's executive commission and the council of eu leaders in about three months . despite initial disagreement over the scope of the measures , the costs and who should pay them - companies or member states - and the duration of data retention , the deputies passed the measures by a clear majority . author wants name withdrawn before the assembly convened in strasbourg , the leaders of the main political groups had agreed to accept a series of late amendments compiled by eu justice ministers at the beginning of the month . the author of the report on which the measures were based , alexander nuno alvaro , a member of parliament for germany 's free-market liberal free democrats , was angered by the move and denounced what he said was " pressure " on the lawmakers . he also demanded that his name be withdrawn from the final text . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe adopts new counterterrorism strategy eu justice and interior ministers adopted on thursday a new counterterrorism strategy , as britain tried to push through tougher security legislation in the face of dogged opposition .

" jugend forscht " is designed to both trigger a scientific interest among youngsters and promote long-term research in the country . back in december 1965 , germany 's weekly news magazine ster n ran an advertisement which said " we 're looking for tomorrow 's researchers . " thus far , the competitive project has not spawned any nobel prize winners , but given that most of those who are invited to stockholm to collect the prestigious prize are over 60 and that " jugend forscht " -lrb- or " youth researches " -rrb- has only been running for four decades , that 's not entirely surprising . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel prize medallion although the competition 's managing director , uta krautkrämer , would be delighted to see the nobel prize go to a german , she stressed that just taking part in the young researchers ' project is a great way to further a scientific career . " we provide participants with contacts and opportunities for internships in prestigious establishments such as the max-planck institute or the frauenhofer institute , " she said , adding that a competition entry on a resume shows potential employers that the candidate has initiative and comes up with independent and innovative ideas . creativite teachi n g equals creative thi n ki n g " jugend forscht " is not only designed to encourage committed youngsters to get competitive , but also to capture the imagination of unsuspecting school children .
and that ca n't start early enough . ulrich hagemann , a teacher at the johann-gottfried-herter high school in cologne , said teachers have to work in creative ways if they wish to encourage creative thinking in their pupils . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ca n't start them early enough " children in the lower years are overflowing with ideas , and the difficult thing is sometimes that they are impossible to implement , " hagemann said .
" in such cases , we have to channel the children 's energy into realistic projects . " he added that it is crucial to encourage children by pointing out the possibilities inherent in their suggestions . scie n ce study too dull nonetheless , by the time youngsters reach the average age for taking part in the competition - between 16 and 21 - they have often grown dismissive of the sciences altogether .
krautkrämer-wagner said only a handful of establishments are actively involved in promoting a healthy interest in science . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : being allowed to experiment can fuel kids ' interest in science " the problem is that science classes do n't offer enough by way of practical study and are thus unattractive for young people , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
she would like to see that situation reversed , not least because of an ongoing interest within the industry in nurturing emerging talent . " it is important that different groups are involved , " krautkrämer-wagner said .
" we are linked to research institutes , foundations and associations , which i think shows pupils how well-supported the project is . " proving that point is crucial if the competition is to continue to grow . helle jeppesen -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : helping scientists juggle kids and career women scientists in germany achieve less success than in most other eu countries .

backers hope to have what they call a wave dragon unit in the sea at west dale bay near milford haven in 2007 .
it is a floating device that works by channelling waves into a reservoir above sea level and uses turbines to generate hydro-electric power .
the aim is to eventually place up to 11 of the units about 10 miles out in the irish sea to generate enough electricity to power 60,000 homes .
kp renewables and wave dragon limited have submitted an application for £ 5m in funding for the first stage of the scheme to the welsh european funding office .
the technology has been developed and tested over the past eight years in denmark and ireland .

it is then released through a number of turbines to generate electricity in the same way as hydro-electric power plants work .
under phase one of the scheme , one unit capable of generating enough electricity for up to 6,000 homes would be tested at west dale bay .
if they pass environmental impact and other regulatory assessments the partners plan to locate up to 11 of the units in deeper water off the west wales coast .
" we expect it to be about 10 miles out in the irish sea , " said wave dragon chairman hans christian sorensen .
" the successful commissioning of the first stage unit will open up the renewable energy market in the uk for wave dragon technology .
" the subsequent development , in the second stage , of a full 70mw installation will represent the uk 's first true wave power station . "
meanwhile , plans to create a tidal lagoon in swansea bay capable of producing energy for more than 10,000 homes are progressing .
tidal electric , which has been doing tests in the area , is about to start seeking planning consent .
it was announced earlier this month that plans by german firm e.on for 30 440ft tall wind turbines at scarweather sands , off porthcawl , were being put on hold until at least 2008 .

it is the first major export pipeline from the landlocked central asian republic which does not cross russia .
it will eventually export oil to feed china 's booming economy from huge reserves around the caspian sea .
kazakhstan wants to become one of the world 's top oil exporters in the next decade or two .
huge oilfields kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev pushed a ceremonial button to start filling the new pipeline with kazakh crude , marking a new stage in his country 's emergence as an oil exporter .
construction began last year on the pipeline from atasu in central kazakhstan to alashankou on the chinese border .
it should be fully operational by the middle of next year , providing a new source of oil for china to develop its western xinjiang region .
eventually another pipeline will link up with this one from the caspian region in west kazakhstan , where the huge new kashagan oilfield is being developed .
with the help of western oil companies , kazakhstan has doubled its production to more than a million barrels a day since the collapse of the soviet union .
that puts it among the world 's top 20 oil producers now , but kazakhstan has ambitions to triple this amount in the next decade or two .
growing leverage until now the country has had to export most of its oil through two pipelines on russian territory .
this meant that ultimately it was moscow 's hand on the tap and russian policy has been to use its control over oil and gas pipelines to pursue its own interests in central asia .
kazakhstan will gain significant leverage in future deals once it has an alternative export route and a thirsty new market .
kazakhstan is also in talks about exporting its oil through the new baku-ceyhan pipeline from the caspian to the mediterranean which opened earlier this year .
oil pundits say the more export routes there are from this once inaccessible region , the better for customers and for the oil producers themselves .

police will have new powers to enforce strict curfews , confiscate cars and ban alcohol sales .
more violence is feared this weekend , as text messages inciting unrest are being sent to many parts of australia .
according to local media , more than 1,000 extra officers will be deployed in the suburbs of sydney .
the state parliament passed the new rules in a special emergency session on thursday .
state premier morris iemma told the new south wales parliament that the authorities were determined to give police the powers they needed to stop the violence .
" louts and criminals have effectively declared war on our society , and we are not going to let them undermine our way of life , " mr iemma was quoted as saying by the french news agency afp .
as part of the changes , police will be able to cordon off trouble spots , stop and search vehicles and seize cars and mobile telephones for up to seven days .
they will also be given the power to close bars and other licensed premises and declare alcohol-free zones .
the maximum sentences for rioting and affray have been increased , and there will be tougher penalties for assault during public disorder .
revenge attack the large-scale violence in sydney started on sunday , when thousands of young white men attacked people of arabic and mediterranean background on cronulla beach - apparently in revenge for a recent attack on two lifeguards .
many of the rioters had been alerted to congregate in the area by receiving text messages .
apparently in retaliation for the violence , groups described by police as having " middle eastern or mediterranean " appearance were involved in two nights of violence and vandalism .
on thursday , prime minister john howard called for calm .
" what we have to try to do is calm everybody down , change the law where necessary , support the police and then reflect in the weeks ahead as to what some of the fundamental reasons are , " he told reporters .
" maybe there were warning signs around that have been ignored that should n't have been ignored , but let 's not do that in the heat of current events . "
local lebanese leaders and southern sydney communities also met on thursday to try and find a solution to the problem .

a group of crackers called team pi coder says it has discovered the basic workings of the console 's file system .
the information has helped the group dig out the raw data from the console for 13 xbox 360 games .
in response microsoft said its console had several security systems in place that would prevent pirated games being played on it .
starting point information about the work of team pi coder was posted to a dutch piracy site along with the raw data from the games .
there was also links to a small program the group produced that helps to extract the data .
in the text file with the extracted data , the pi coders admit that not much can be done with the data .
" you ca n't run these dumps yet , but you will be able to sooner or later , " reads the information file .
the crackers have not managed to get the data off game disks , instead they have dug out the version of the game that the xbox 360 creates when gamers start playing .
the crackers said they were releasing the raw data to help other hacking groups start the task of working out how the xbox 360 tries to stop piracy .
" so the first task is done , " wrote team pi in the information files .
" we hope this encourages all hackers , coders and crackers out there to take up the challenge . "
using the raw data could prove a challenge because the extraction has left intact the protection systems that ensure that copies will not run on an xbox 360 .
the non-standard format of xbox 360 dvds also means that a pc dvd drive will not read them either .
a spokesman for microsoft said there had been a series of improvements to the xbox 360 that protect it against cracking .
he said that hardware on the system only allows microsoft certified and signed programs to run on the console .
this meant that copied games would not be recognised by the system and would not run .

the british journal nature examined a range of scientific entries on both works of reference and found few differences in accuracy .
wikipedia is produced by volunteers , who add entries and edit any page .
but it has been criticised for the correctness of entries , most recently over the biography of prominent us journalist john seigenthaler .
open approach wikipedia was founded in 2001 and has since grown to more than 1.8 million articles in 200 languages .
some 800,000 entries are in english .
it is based on wikis , open-source software which lets anyone fiddle with a webpage , anyone reading a subject entry can disagree , edit , add , delete , or replace the entry . "
we 're very pleased with the results and we 're hoping it will focus people 's attention on the overall level of our work , which is pretty good " jimmy wales , wikipedia founder it relies on 13,000 volunteer contributors , many of whom are experts in a particular field , to edit previously submitted articles .
in order to test its reliability , nature conducted a peer review of scientific entries on wikipedia and the well-established encyclopedia britannica .
the reviewers were asked to check for errors , but were not told about the source of the information .
" only eight serious errors , such as misinterpretations of important concepts , were detected in the pairs of articles reviewed , four from each encyclopedia , " reported nature .
" but reviewers also found many factual errors , omissions or misleading statements : 162 and 123 in wikipedia and britannica , respectively . "
wikipedia founder jimmy wales welcomed the study .
" we 're hoping it will focus people 's attention on the overall level of our work , which is pretty good , " he said .
writing style nature said its reviewers found that wikipedia entries were often poorly structured and confused .
the encyclopedia britannica declined to comment directly on the findings ; but a spokesman highlighted the quality of the entries on the free resource .
" but it is not the case that errors creep in on an occasional basis or that a couple of articles are poorly written , " tom panelas , director of corporate communications is quoted as saying in nature .
" there are lots of articles in that condition .
they need a good editor . "
wikipedia came under fire earlier this month from prominent us journalist john seigenthaler .
the founding editorial director of usa today attacked a wikipedia entry that incorrectly named him as a suspect in the assassinations of president john f kennedy and his brother , robert .
the false information was the work of tennessean brian chase , who said he was trying to trick a co-worker .
wikipedia has responded to the criticisms by tightening up procedures .
next month it plans to begin testing a new mechanism for reviewing the accuracy of its articles .
