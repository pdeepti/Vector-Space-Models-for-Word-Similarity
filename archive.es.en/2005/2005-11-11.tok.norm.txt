they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "
on friday morning , he met with chancellor designate angela merkel , before heading off for an official meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , who has used his chancellorship to open the door to the chinese market for german companies . the chancellor was criticized regularly by human rights groups for a china strategy they charged ignored the country 's poor human rights record .
his attempt , together with france , to lift an eu weapons embargo on china ultimately fizzled . hu will likely not be happy to hear that merkel 's government wo n't continue schröder 's campaign .
embargo not on the merkel agenda " lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " the foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told thursday 's berliner zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu with köhler in front of charlottenburg palace .
at left is koehler 's wife eva luise , hu 's wife liu yongqing is second from left . in his remarks thursday evening , hu did n't address the embargo issue or human rights . instead , he said that the signing of business deals showed how close china and germany worked together in the fields of economy , culture and science . " i am convinced that closer cooperation will serve the people of both countries , " hu said . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . hu is to visit the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday before heading to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economics could trump human rights at china talks chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .

called xcp , the software anti-piracy systems uses something called a " root kit " to conceal the program used to stop some of its cds from being copied . the software restricts unauthorized copying , but also contains a hidden file that security experts say can track consumer behavior .
the program , created by the british firm first 4 internet , uses the cloaking system to hide a proprietary media player that a consumer must download to play the cds with the protection software . a class-action lawsuit has been filed in california , and another one is expected in new york , accusing the music company of infecting consumers ' computers with virus-like techniques which can not be removed without damaging the computer . sony bmg : misunderstanding sony bmg , however , disputes the accusations , saying the software developed by first 4 internet employs normal copy protection technology and does not make computers , as has been reported from some quarters , more susceptible to security breaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burn , baby , burn ?
sony bmg would rather you not sony bmg 's europe director , maarten steinkamp , said that there is a lot of confusion and misunderstanding around the matter .
however , he said the company was testing various digital rights management systems and was looking for the " best and most sensible " method of " protecting the property of the company and of the artists . " " clearly , we will only use technology in europe that is secure for the consumer as well as error-free , " said steinkamp . sony bmg put a patch on its web site - after the complaints in the us got louder - which made the formerly invisible file on the xcp system visible , but that has done little to calm the consumer outrage .

" lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
pflüger added on friday that " the pre-condition for lifting the embargo is an improvement in the human rights situation and a relaxation of the taiwan issue . " focus on energy , environment so with the weapons embargo omitted from the agenda , hu 's 45-minute meeting with merkel focused on energy and the environment , according to german participants in the meeting . hu , on the second day of his visit to germany and the second leg of a european tour , told merkel that china was no longer solely a nation which imported its energy needs , but was rapidly becoming a producer of electricity . merkel , a former environment minister , expressed her concern that china 's rapid economic development was taking a heavy ecological toll . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu jintao with outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder hu also held talks with schröder later friday . schröder however told hu , much to the anger of merkel 's conservatives , that he believed the european union would find a " sensible solution " to its arms embargo on china . schröder said that he still backed lifting the 16-year-old ban on arms sales .

those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .
some 12 percent of those asked did show signs of addictive behavior , although researchers did not find a link between excessive computer game playing and higher levels of aggression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video gaming in germany lags behind europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .

those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .
-lrb- nov .
3 , 2005 -rrb- köhler : debate needed on army 's future at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future .

11 , 2005 -rrb- how two armies became one the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .
the two german armies , once prepared to shoot at each other , had to put mistrust aside and be combined smoothly into one unit .

" we will get it done today , " said franz josef jung , the incoming defense minister . he said the two sides had made " a decisive step forward " by reaching agreement thursday on most of the remaining points -lrb- on divergence . -rrb- renate schmidt , who is to become justice minister , said the new government 's program would be ready at 18:00 utc . the eu 's most populous country was forced to pursue an unusual " grand coalition " left-right power-sharing agreement after the general election on sept .
18 failed to produce a governing majority for either of the main parties . a copy of a draft agreement circulating late thursday outlined points of consensus already reached but there were several headings that were stamped " unresolved , " including increases in the value-added tax , a tax on the high-earners , protection against dismissal and phasing out nuclear power .
the text also included an agreement to put off until 2006 any discussion of reforming the creaking public health care system due to the two sides ' starkly differing proposals . the pact must be completed by saturday to allow approval by the rank and file of the two parties at separate congresses next week , paving the way for merkel to be voted in on nov .
22 as the country 's first female chancellor . the talks , designed to lay out a plan of action for the government 's four-year term , have been particularly hard-fought because they bring together bitter rivals from the two sides of germany 's political divide .
going american ?
incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- warned that while some progress had been made , nothing was certain until all the key points had been wrapped up . " there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .
higher vat or wealth tax ?
the second major hurdle to a deal is germany 's dire fiscal situation .
the parties have agreed to attempt to slash a record 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- from the public budget by 2007 to bring down the deficit .
but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy . " however , the head of germany 's bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , welcomed signs of a real attempt to bring the deficit down to conform to eu budget rules . " if i take a sober look at it all , i personally am not disappointed , " he told german radio . the two sides are also at odds over the future of the country 's nuclear power plants .
while the previous coalition government of social democrats and greens passed legislation to mothball the sites over the next two decades , the conservatives want to extend their service . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks east for new leadership with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification .

" we will get it done today , " said franz josef jung , the incoming defense minister . he said the two sides had made " a decisive step forward " by reaching agreement thursday on most of the remaining points -lrb- on divergence . -rrb- renate schmidt , who is to become justice minister , said the new government 's program would be ready at 18:00 utc . the eu 's most populous country was forced to pursue an unusual " grand coalition " left-right power-sharing agreement after the general election on sept .
18 failed to produce a governing majority for either of the main parties . a copy of a draft agreement circulating late thursday outlined points of consensus already reached but there were several headings that were stamped " unresolved , " including increases in the value-added tax , a tax on the high-earners , protection against dismissal and phasing out nuclear power .
the text also included an agreement to put off until 2006 any discussion of reforming the creaking public health care system due to the two sides ' starkly differing proposals . the pact must be completed by saturday to allow approval by the rank and file of the two parties at separate congresses next week , paving the way for merkel to be voted in on nov .
22 as the country 's first female chancellor . the talks , designed to lay out a plan of action for the government 's four-year term , have been particularly hard-fought because they bring together bitter rivals from the two sides of germany 's political divide .
going american ?
incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- warned that while some progress had been made , nothing was certain until all the key points had been wrapped up . " there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .
higher vat or wealth tax ?
the second major hurdle to a deal is germany 's dire fiscal situation .
the parties have agreed to attempt to slash a record 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- from the public budget by 2007 to bring down the deficit .
but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy . " however , the head of germany 's bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , welcomed signs of a real attempt to bring the deficit down to conform to eu budget rules . " if i take a sober look at it all , i personally am not disappointed , " he told german radio . the two sides are also at odds over the future of the country 's nuclear power plants .
while the previous coalition government of social democrats and greens passed legislation to mothball the sites over the next two decades , the conservatives want to extend their service . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks east for new leadership with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification .

called xcp , the software anti-piracy systems uses something called a " root kit " to conceal the program used to stop some of its cds from being copied . the software restricts unauthorized copying , but also contains a hidden file that security experts say can track consumer behavior .
the program , created by the british firm first 4 internet , uses the cloaking system to hide a proprietary media player that a consumer must download to play the cds with the protection software . a class-action lawsuit has been filed in california , and another one is expected in new york , accusing the music company of infecting consumers ' computers with virus-like techniques which can not be removed without damaging the computer . sony bmg : misunderstanding sony bmg , however , disputes the accusations , saying the software developed by first 4 internet employs normal copy protection technology and does not make computers , as has been reported from some quarters , more susceptible to security breaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burn , baby , burn ?

" " clearly , we will only use technology in europe that is secure for the consumer as well as error-free , " said steinkamp . sony bmg put a patch on its web site - after the complaints in the us got louder - which made the formerly invisible file on the xcp system visible , but that has done little to calm the consumer outrage .

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2005 germany rolls out red carpet for chinese president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu jintao , with köhler , is looking to firm up economic ties china 's president arrived in berlin thursday night and was met with the praise of german president horst köhler and the protests of only a few human rights campaigners . members of the falun gong spiritual movement , whose members are persecuted and jailed in china , began a 24-hour protest vigil thursday evening after president hu jintao arrived in berlin .
they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "

called xcp , the software anti-piracy systems uses something called a " root kit " to conceal the program used to stop some of its cds from being copied . the software restricts unauthorized copying , but also contains a hidden file that security experts say can track consumer behavior .
the program , created by the british firm first 4 internet , uses the cloaking system to hide a proprietary media player that a consumer must download to play the cds with the protection software . a class-action lawsuit has been filed in california , and another one is expected in new york , accusing the music company of infecting consumers ' computers with virus-like techniques which can not be removed without damaging the computer . sony bmg : misunderstanding sony bmg , however , disputes the accusations , saying the software developed by first 4 internet employs normal copy protection technology and does not make computers , as has been reported from some quarters , more susceptible to security breaches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : burn , baby , burn ?

" " clearly , we will only use technology in europe that is secure for the consumer as well as error-free , " said steinkamp . sony bmg put a patch on its web site - after the complaints in the us got louder - which made the formerly invisible file on the xcp system visible , but that has done little to calm the consumer outrage .

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .
some 12 percent of those asked did show signs of addictive behavior , although researchers did not find a link between excessive computer game playing and higher levels of aggression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video gaming in germany lags behind europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .

" we will get it done today , " said franz josef jung , the incoming defense minister . he said the two sides had made " a decisive step forward " by reaching agreement thursday on most of the remaining points -lrb- on divergence . -rrb- renate schmidt , who is to become justice minister , said the new government 's program would be ready at 18:00 utc . the eu 's most populous country was forced to pursue an unusual " grand coalition " left-right power-sharing agreement after the general election on sept .
18 failed to produce a governing majority for either of the main parties . a copy of a draft agreement circulating late thursday outlined points of consensus already reached but there were several headings that were stamped " unresolved , " including increases in the value-added tax , a tax on the high-earners , protection against dismissal and phasing out nuclear power .
the text also included an agreement to put off until 2006 any discussion of reforming the creaking public health care system due to the two sides ' starkly differing proposals . the pact must be completed by saturday to allow approval by the rank and file of the two parties at separate congresses next week , paving the way for merkel to be voted in on nov .
22 as the country 's first female chancellor . the talks , designed to lay out a plan of action for the government 's four-year term , have been particularly hard-fought because they bring together bitter rivals from the two sides of germany 's political divide .
going american ?
incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- warned that while some progress had been made , nothing was certain until all the key points had been wrapped up . " there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .
higher vat or wealth tax ?
the second major hurdle to a deal is germany 's dire fiscal situation .
the parties have agreed to attempt to slash a record 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- from the public budget by 2007 to bring down the deficit .
but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy .

" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate .

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .
some 12 percent of those asked did show signs of addictive behavior , although researchers did not find a link between excessive computer game playing and higher levels of aggression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video gaming in germany lags behind europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .

they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "
on friday morning , he met with chancellor designate angela merkel , before heading off for an official meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , who has used his chancellorship to open the door to the chinese market for german companies . the chancellor was criticized regularly by human rights groups for a china strategy they charged ignored the country 's poor human rights record .
his attempt , together with france , to lift an eu weapons embargo on china ultimately fizzled . hu will likely not be happy to hear that merkel 's government wo n't continue schröder 's campaign .
embargo not on the merkel agenda " lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " the foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told thursday 's berliner zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu with köhler in front of charlottenburg palace .

" i am convinced that closer cooperation will serve the people of both countries , " hu said . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . hu is to visit the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday before heading to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economics could trump human rights at china talks chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr current affairs -pipe- 11.11.2005 opinion : the germans and their army großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modest birthday party when the bundeswehr marked its 50th anniversary with a military tattoo , few germans seemed to care .
those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .
some 12 percent of those asked did show signs of addictive behavior , although researchers did not find a link between excessive computer game playing and higher levels of aggression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video gaming in germany lags behind europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr current affairs -pipe- 11.11.2005 opinion : the germans and their army großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modest birthday party when the bundeswehr marked its 50th anniversary with a military tattoo , few germans seemed to care .
those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .
-lrb- nov .
3 , 2005 -rrb- köhler : debate needed on army 's future at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future .

those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .

" we will get it done today , " said franz josef jung , the incoming defense minister . he said the two sides had made " a decisive step forward " by reaching agreement thursday on most of the remaining points -lrb- on divergence . -rrb- renate schmidt , who is to become justice minister , said the new government 's program would be ready at 18:00 utc . the eu 's most populous country was forced to pursue an unusual " grand coalition " left-right power-sharing agreement after the general election on sept .
18 failed to produce a governing majority for either of the main parties . a copy of a draft agreement circulating late thursday outlined points of consensus already reached but there were several headings that were stamped " unresolved , " including increases in the value-added tax , a tax on the high-earners , protection against dismissal and phasing out nuclear power .
the text also included an agreement to put off until 2006 any discussion of reforming the creaking public health care system due to the two sides ' starkly differing proposals . the pact must be completed by saturday to allow approval by the rank and file of the two parties at separate congresses next week , paving the way for merkel to be voted in on nov .
22 as the country 's first female chancellor . the talks , designed to lay out a plan of action for the government 's four-year term , have been particularly hard-fought because they bring together bitter rivals from the two sides of germany 's political divide .
going american ?
incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- warned that while some progress had been made , nothing was certain until all the key points had been wrapped up . " there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .
higher vat or wealth tax ?
the second major hurdle to a deal is germany 's dire fiscal situation .
the parties have agreed to attempt to slash a record 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- from the public budget by 2007 to bring down the deficit .
but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy . " however , the head of germany 's bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , welcomed signs of a real attempt to bring the deficit down to conform to eu budget rules . " if i take a sober look at it all , i personally am not disappointed , " he told german radio . the two sides are also at odds over the future of the country 's nuclear power plants .
while the previous coalition government of social democrats and greens passed legislation to mothball the sites over the next two decades , the conservatives want to extend their service . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks east for new leadership with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification .

they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "
on friday morning , he met with chancellor designate angela merkel , before heading off for an official meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , who has used his chancellorship to open the door to the chinese market for german companies . the chancellor was criticized regularly by human rights groups for a china strategy they charged ignored the country 's poor human rights record .
his attempt , together with france , to lift an eu weapons embargo on china ultimately fizzled . hu will likely not be happy to hear that merkel 's government wo n't continue schröder 's campaign .
embargo not on the merkel agenda " lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " the foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told thursday 's berliner zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu with köhler in front of charlottenburg palace .
at left is koehler 's wife eva luise , hu 's wife liu yongqing is second from left . in his remarks thursday evening , hu did n't address the embargo issue or human rights . instead , he said that the signing of business deals showed how close china and germany worked together in the fields of economy , culture and science . " i am convinced that closer cooperation will serve the people of both countries , " hu said . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . hu is to visit the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday before heading to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economics could trump human rights at china talks chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .

players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .

the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2005 germany rolls out red carpet for chinese president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu jintao , with köhler , is looking to firm up economic ties china 's president arrived in berlin thursday night and was met with the praise of german president horst köhler and the protests of only a few human rights campaigners . members of the falun gong spiritual movement , whose members are persecuted and jailed in china , began a 24-hour protest vigil thursday evening after president hu jintao arrived in berlin .
they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "
on friday morning , he met with chancellor designate angela merkel , before heading off for an official meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , who has used his chancellorship to open the door to the chinese market for german companies . the chancellor was criticized regularly by human rights groups for a china strategy they charged ignored the country 's poor human rights record .
his attempt , together with france , to lift an eu weapons embargo on china ultimately fizzled . hu will likely not be happy to hear that merkel 's government wo n't continue schröder 's campaign .
embargo not on the merkel agenda " lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " the foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told thursday 's berliner zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu with köhler in front of charlottenburg palace .
at left is koehler 's wife eva luise , hu 's wife liu yongqing is second from left . in his remarks thursday evening , hu did n't address the embargo issue or human rights . instead , he said that the signing of business deals showed how close china and germany worked together in the fields of economy , culture and science . " i am convinced that closer cooperation will serve the people of both countries , " hu said . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . hu is to visit the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday before heading to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economics could trump human rights at china talks chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .
some 12 percent of those asked did show signs of addictive behavior , although researchers did not find a link between excessive computer game playing and higher levels of aggression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video gaming in germany lags behind europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr current affairs -pipe- 11.11.2005 opinion : the germans and their army großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modest birthday party when the bundeswehr marked its 50th anniversary with a military tattoo , few germans seemed to care .
those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .
-lrb- nov .
3 , 2005 -rrb- köhler : debate needed on army 's future at a high-level meeting of military officials in bonn , president horst köhler honored the german armed forces ' 50 years of service to the cause of freedom and security , and called for a debate on the bundeswehr 's future .

11 , 2005 -rrb- how two armies became one the reunification of germany in 1990 not only meant the unity of political entities .

those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .

" we will get it done today , " said franz josef jung , the incoming defense minister . he said the two sides had made " a decisive step forward " by reaching agreement thursday on most of the remaining points -lrb- on divergence . -rrb- renate schmidt , who is to become justice minister , said the new government 's program would be ready at 18:00 utc . the eu 's most populous country was forced to pursue an unusual " grand coalition " left-right power-sharing agreement after the general election on sept .

the text also included an agreement to put off until 2006 any discussion of reforming the creaking public health care system due to the two sides ' starkly differing proposals . the pact must be completed by saturday to allow approval by the rank and file of the two parties at separate congresses next week , paving the way for merkel to be voted in on nov .
22 as the country 's first female chancellor . the talks , designed to lay out a plan of action for the government 's four-year term , have been particularly hard-fought because they bring together bitter rivals from the two sides of germany 's political divide .

incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- warned that while some progress had been made , nothing was certain until all the key points had been wrapped up . " there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .
higher vat or wealth tax ?
the second major hurdle to a deal is germany 's dire fiscal situation .
the parties have agreed to attempt to slash a record 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- from the public budget by 2007 to bring down the deficit .
but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy . " however , the head of germany 's bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , welcomed signs of a real attempt to bring the deficit down to conform to eu budget rules . " if i take a sober look at it all , i personally am not disappointed , " he told german radio . the two sides are also at odds over the future of the country 's nuclear power plants .
while the previous coalition government of social democrats and greens passed legislation to mothball the sites over the next two decades , the conservatives want to extend their service . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks east for new leadership with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2005 germany rolls out red carpet for chinese president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu jintao , with köhler , is looking to firm up economic ties china 's president arrived in berlin thursday night and was met with the praise of german president horst köhler and the protests of only a few human rights campaigners . members of the falun gong spiritual movement , whose members are persecuted and jailed in china , began a 24-hour protest vigil thursday evening after president hu jintao arrived in berlin .
they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "
on friday morning , he met with chancellor designate angela merkel , before heading off for an official meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , who has used his chancellorship to open the door to the chinese market for german companies . the chancellor was criticized regularly by human rights groups for a china strategy they charged ignored the country 's poor human rights record .
his attempt , together with france , to lift an eu weapons embargo on china ultimately fizzled . hu will likely not be happy to hear that merkel 's government wo n't continue schröder 's campaign .
embargo not on the merkel agenda " lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " the foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told thursday 's berliner zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu with köhler in front of charlottenburg palace .

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .
some 12 percent of those asked did show signs of addictive behavior , although researchers did not find a link between excessive computer game playing and higher levels of aggression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video gaming in germany lags behind europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr current affairs -pipe- 11.11.2005 opinion : the germans and their army großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modest birthday party when the bundeswehr marked its 50th anniversary with a military tattoo , few germans seemed to care .
those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .

those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr current affairs -pipe- 11.11.2005 opinion : the germans and their army großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modest birthday party when the bundeswehr marked its 50th anniversary with a military tattoo , few germans seemed to care .
those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .

" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship .

" i am convinced that closer cooperation will serve the people of both countries , " hu said . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . hu is to visit the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday before heading to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economics could trump human rights at china talks chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .

they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "
on friday morning , he met with chancellor designate angela merkel , before heading off for an official meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , who has used his chancellorship to open the door to the chinese market for german companies . the chancellor was criticized regularly by human rights groups for a china strategy they charged ignored the country 's poor human rights record .
his attempt , together with france , to lift an eu weapons embargo on china ultimately fizzled . hu will likely not be happy to hear that merkel 's government wo n't continue schröder 's campaign .
embargo not on the merkel agenda " lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " the foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told thursday 's berliner zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu with köhler in front of charlottenburg palace .
at left is koehler 's wife eva luise , hu 's wife liu yongqing is second from left . in his remarks thursday evening , hu did n't address the embargo issue or human rights . instead , he said that the signing of business deals showed how close china and germany worked together in the fields of economy , culture and science . " i am convinced that closer cooperation will serve the people of both countries , " hu said . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . hu is to visit the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday before heading to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economics could trump human rights at china talks chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .

" we will get it done today , " said franz josef jung , the incoming defense minister . he said the two sides had made " a decisive step forward " by reaching agreement thursday on most of the remaining points -lrb- on divergence . -rrb- renate schmidt , who is to become justice minister , said the new government 's program would be ready at 18:00 utc . the eu 's most populous country was forced to pursue an unusual " grand coalition " left-right power-sharing agreement after the general election on sept .
18 failed to produce a governing majority for either of the main parties . a copy of a draft agreement circulating late thursday outlined points of consensus already reached but there were several headings that were stamped " unresolved , " including increases in the value-added tax , a tax on the high-earners , protection against dismissal and phasing out nuclear power .
the text also included an agreement to put off until 2006 any discussion of reforming the creaking public health care system due to the two sides ' starkly differing proposals . the pact must be completed by saturday to allow approval by the rank and file of the two parties at separate congresses next week , paving the way for merkel to be voted in on nov .
22 as the country 's first female chancellor . the talks , designed to lay out a plan of action for the government 's four-year term , have been particularly hard-fought because they bring together bitter rivals from the two sides of germany 's political divide .
going american ?
incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- warned that while some progress had been made , nothing was certain until all the key points had been wrapped up . " there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .
higher vat or wealth tax ?
the second major hurdle to a deal is germany 's dire fiscal situation .
the parties have agreed to attempt to slash a record 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- from the public budget by 2007 to bring down the deficit .
but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy . " however , the head of germany 's bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , welcomed signs of a real attempt to bring the deficit down to conform to eu budget rules . " if i take a sober look at it all , i personally am not disappointed , " he told german radio . the two sides are also at odds over the future of the country 's nuclear power plants .
while the previous coalition government of social democrats and greens passed legislation to mothball the sites over the next two decades , the conservatives want to extend their service . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks east for new leadership with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification .

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .
some 12 percent of those asked did show signs of addictive behavior , although researchers did not find a link between excessive computer game playing and higher levels of aggression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video gaming in germany lags behind europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .

they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "
on friday morning , he met with chancellor designate angela merkel , before heading off for an official meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , who has used his chancellorship to open the door to the chinese market for german companies . the chancellor was criticized regularly by human rights groups for a china strategy they charged ignored the country 's poor human rights record .
his attempt , together with france , to lift an eu weapons embargo on china ultimately fizzled . hu will likely not be happy to hear that merkel 's government wo n't continue schröder 's campaign .
embargo not on the merkel agenda " lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " the foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told thursday 's berliner zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu with köhler in front of charlottenburg palace .
at left is koehler 's wife eva luise , hu 's wife liu yongqing is second from left . in his remarks thursday evening , hu did n't address the embargo issue or human rights . instead , he said that the signing of business deals showed how close china and germany worked together in the fields of economy , culture and science . " i am convinced that closer cooperation will serve the people of both countries , " hu said . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . hu is to visit the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday before heading to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economics could trump human rights at china talks chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .

they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "
on friday morning , he met with chancellor designate angela merkel , before heading off for an official meeting with chancellor gerhard schröder , who has used his chancellorship to open the door to the chinese market for german companies . the chancellor was criticized regularly by human rights groups for a china strategy they charged ignored the country 's poor human rights record .
his attempt , together with france , to lift an eu weapons embargo on china ultimately fizzled . hu will likely not be happy to hear that merkel 's government wo n't continue schröder 's campaign .
embargo not on the merkel agenda " lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " the foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told thursday 's berliner zeitung newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu with köhler in front of charlottenburg palace .
at left is koehler 's wife eva luise , hu 's wife liu yongqing is second from left . in his remarks thursday evening , hu did n't address the embargo issue or human rights . instead , he said that the signing of business deals showed how close china and germany worked together in the fields of economy , culture and science . " i am convinced that closer cooperation will serve the people of both countries , " hu said . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . hu is to visit the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday before heading to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- dre -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de economics could trump human rights at china talks chinese president hu jintao begins a four-day visit to germany on thursday .

" there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .

but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy . " however , the head of germany 's bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , welcomed signs of a real attempt to bring the deficit down to conform to eu budget rules . " if i take a sober look at it all , i personally am not disappointed , " he told german radio . the two sides are also at odds over the future of the country 's nuclear power plants .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr current affairs -pipe- 11.11.2005 opinion : the germans and their army großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modest birthday party when the bundeswehr marked its 50th anniversary with a military tattoo , few germans seemed to care .
those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .

those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .

" lifting the arms embargo is not on the agenda of the new government , " foreign policy spokesman of merkel 's christian democrats , friedbert pflüger , told the berliner zeitung newspaper .
pflüger added on friday that " the pre-condition for lifting the embargo is an improvement in the human rights situation and a relaxation of the taiwan issue . " focus on energy , environment so with the weapons embargo omitted from the agenda , hu 's 45-minute meeting with merkel focused on energy and the environment , according to german participants in the meeting . hu , on the second day of his visit to germany and the second leg of a european tour , told merkel that china was no longer solely a nation which imported its energy needs , but was rapidly becoming a producer of electricity . merkel , a former environment minister , expressed her concern that china 's rapid economic development was taking a heavy ecological toll . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hu jintao with outgoing german chancellor gerhard schröder hu also held talks with schröder later friday . schröder however told hu , much to the anger of merkel 's conservatives , that he believed the european union would find a " sensible solution " to its arms embargo on china . schröder said that he still backed lifting the 16-year-old ban on arms sales . " my opinion on the arms embargo has not changed , " schröder told a joint press conference with hu . " but i believe the european union will work towards a sensible solution .
germany will work with france on this issue . " france has backed schröder 's efforts to scrap the arms ban , although their joint position has angered some of their eu partners and the united states . hu 's visit dogged by protests rights group amnesty international had called on merkel to raise the issue of human rights during her talks with hu . amnesty said she should ask china to impose a moratorium on its use of the death penalty and argued that germany 's approach of trying to promote " change through trade " in china had failed and should be re-assessed . after spending three days in britain , hu began his four-day stay in germany by overseeing the signing of a raft of business and cultural agreements on thursday , including a deal which will see electronics giant siemens supply 60 high-speed trains to china as part of a 1.3-billion-euro -lrb- $ 1.5-billion -rrb- agreement . but as in britain , hu 's visit is being dogged by human rights protests . several hundred members of the falun gong spiritual movement gathered outside the charlottenburg palace where he held talks with german president horst köhler on thursday , but pro-china supporters were also out in force . trade still tops the agenda despite the protests , europe is rolling out the red carpet for hu , keen to secure trade deals with the world 's most populous country . deals with british-based companies worth a total of 783 million pounds -lrb- 1.2 billion euros , $ 1.3 billion -rrb- were struck on the first leg of the tour . germany is china 's biggest european trade partner , with german exports to china rising 12.7 percent in the first half of 2005 to 9.48 billion euros . the president was also to lay the foundation stone of a new chinese cultural centre in berlin on friday before visiting the industrial region of north rhine-westphalia on saturday . he is scheduled to head to spain on sunday morning . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany rolls out red carpet for chinese president china 's president arrived in berlin thursday night and was met with the praise of german president horst köhler and the protests of only a few human rights campaigners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2005 germany rolls out red carpet for chinese president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president hu jintao , with köhler , is looking to firm up economic ties china 's president arrived in berlin thursday night and was met with the praise of german president horst köhler and the protests of only a few human rights campaigners . members of the falun gong spiritual movement , whose members are persecuted and jailed in china , began a 24-hour protest vigil thursday evening after president hu jintao arrived in berlin .
they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "

they plan to continue until his departure on sunday . their protests will largely fall on deaf ears among german government officials .
germany 's leadership has proven in the past few years that it clearly recognizes china 's growing economic might , and president köhler was no exception . after talks with hu , köhler said china had " achieved an enormous amount in the past few decades and is taking huge strides " . he had only reserved criticism for the communist regime following a meeting with hu in berlin 's opulent charlottenburg palace thursday evening .
" we know that everything comes in its own time and we understand that china is making its own way , but we also know that the will of the people to live in freedom and dignity is universal , " köhler told the press conference . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bundespraesident horst köhler had mostly praise for the " great strides " china has made in recent years chancellor 's open door policy the two heads of state broke ground on a chinese cultural center in berlin which , according to hu , will help " further develop our relationship . "

"
players were classified as " excessive " if they met at least three criteria for dependency : insatiable yearning , withdrawal symptoms or a neglect of other interests in their lives . the test subjects were then shown pictures of computer games , alcoholic drinks and neutral objects .
the pictures of computer games elicited much stronger reactions in the brains of excessive players than they did in those of the occasional computer gamers .
the excessive players also demonstrated weak responses to pictures in the other two categories . " excessive playing of computer games presumably activates the same structures in the brain as drugs do , " said sabine grüsser from the interdisciplinary addiction research group of the charité hospital . in another study , researchers asked around 7,000 gamers about their computer gaming and collected data on aggression and tendencies toward violent behavior .
some 12 percent of those asked did show signs of addictive behavior , although researchers did not find a link between excessive computer game playing and higher levels of aggression . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de video gaming in germany lags behind europe 's biggest computer gaming trade fair , currently on in leipzig , is drawing in record crowds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 50 years of the bundeswehr when bullies enter the military german defense minister joins abuse investigation kosovo : a watershed for german foreign policy students on target for the bundeswehr current affairs -pipe- 11.11.2005 opinion : the germans and their army großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a modest birthday party when the bundeswehr marked its 50th anniversary with a military tattoo , few germans seemed to care .
those who did were more apt to protest - a sign of a continued uneasy relationship , says dw 's nina werkhäuser . when the bundeswehr held a military tattoo in front of the reichstag at the end of october to celebrate its 50th birthday , berlin 's government district was sealed off as if in preparation for invasion from an enemy force .
everywhere you looked , there were military police and street blockades , and only invited guests were allowed in to watch the event .
the atmosphere brought to mind the state visit of the iraqi president , a man whose life is constantly under threat .
but what enemies does the bundeswehr have that it ca n't mark such a milestone in peace ? for 50 years now , the bundeswehr has been the army of the german parliament , which watches over its actions .
it 's a lesson from the history books , and a very sensible one at that .
but this modern reality is out of step with a part of the german population , as the protests that accompanied the ceremonial tattoo showed . as soon as the marching music began to play , talk of senseless glorification of the military started to make the rounds .
even members of parliament from the left party started to scream blue murder instead of soberly acknowledging that the model of a parliamentary army has worked well for half a century . characterized by modesty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nazi era has left many germans uncomfortable with displays of patriotism you can accuse the bundeswehr of many things , but certainly not of holding on to dusty old rituals or surrounding itself with superficial pomp and ceremony .
after all , it 's not as if the army marched down berlin 's main boulevard , unter den linden , accompanied by the buzzing of fighter jets overhead , to mark its anniversary . instead , the bundeswehr celebrated modestly , as has been its habit for the past 50 years .
and it 's that modesty which characterizes a military that , since 1955 , has had to carefully tread a path between tradition and a new beginning . there 's an understandable element in some germans ' out-of-hand rejection of all things military , and it 's grounded in the experience of national socialism .
but 60 years on , the view of the bundeswehr seems to still be so distorted that the general public has to be barred from an event such as a military tattoo . even if outspoken bundeswehr opponents are in the minority , the general disinterest in the armed forces is shockingly great .
so great , that german president horst köhler addressed it in his pensive anniversary address .
" the germans seem to barely be touched or impressed by all of this , " köhler said about the numerous foreign assignments undertaken by the bundeswehr . public indifference in the last 50 years , more than 9 million germans have completed military service with the bundeswehr , but that does n't seem to have impressed upon the public consciousness the reality faced by german soldiers each day .
they risk their lives to stop wars and conflicts abroad , in order to keep germany safe .
the fact that , so far , relatively few german soldiers have lost their lives may be a contributing factor to the general indifference . the ceremonies marking 50 years of the bundeswehr 's existence demonstrated , once again , how tense the relationship between the army and german society still is .
we 're happy to call on our soldiers when our rivers break their banks , and we call for their expertise when a threat looms .
but aside from that , the attitude toward the military is one of " no , thanks ! "
and the bundeswehr , banned to a sort of permanent probation period , is left to celebrate its birthday alone . nina werkhäuser -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to extend troops ' mandate in war on terror the outgoing german cabinet agreed on wednesday to extend the mandate of the country 's troops in the us-led " operation enduring freedom " by a year from november 15 , a spokesman said .

called xcp , the software anti-piracy systems uses something called a " root kit " to conceal the program used to stop some of its cds from being copied . the software restricts unauthorized copying , but also contains a hidden file that security experts say can track consumer behavior .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.11.2005 coalition partners say government will be formed by weekend großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : problems remain but the parties are nearing a consensus germany 's main political parties said they want to reach agreement friday on a program for the incoming coalition government , ending almost two months of political limbo following inconclusive elections . the conservative christian democrats of incoming chancellor angela merkel and outgoing leader gerhard schröder 's center-left social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are still divided on several issues including tax increases and spending cuts . they want to complete their haggling in order to present the proposed program to their rank and file members at party congresses next week . a new round of negotiations was to start at 16:00 utc on friday and , despite earlier suggestions that the talks could go into the weekend , several key participants said that would not be necessary . " we will get it done today , " said franz josef jung , the incoming defense minister . he said the two sides had made " a decisive step forward " by reaching agreement thursday on most of the remaining points -lrb- on divergence . -rrb- renate schmidt , who is to become justice minister , said the new government 's program would be ready at 18:00 utc . the eu 's most populous country was forced to pursue an unusual " grand coalition " left-right power-sharing agreement after the general election on sept .
18 failed to produce a governing majority for either of the main parties . a copy of a draft agreement circulating late thursday outlined points of consensus already reached but there were several headings that were stamped " unresolved , " including increases in the value-added tax , a tax on the high-earners , protection against dismissal and phasing out nuclear power .
the text also included an agreement to put off until 2006 any discussion of reforming the creaking public health care system due to the two sides ' starkly differing proposals . the pact must be completed by saturday to allow approval by the rank and file of the two parties at separate congresses next week , paving the way for merkel to be voted in on nov .
22 as the country 's first female chancellor . the talks , designed to lay out a plan of action for the government 's four-year term , have been particularly hard-fought because they bring together bitter rivals from the two sides of germany 's political divide .
going american ?
incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- warned that while some progress had been made , nothing was certain until all the key points had been wrapped up . " there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .
higher vat or wealth tax ?
the second major hurdle to a deal is germany 's dire fiscal situation .
the parties have agreed to attempt to slash a record 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- from the public budget by 2007 to bring down the deficit .
but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy . " however , the head of germany 's bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , welcomed signs of a real attempt to bring the deficit down to conform to eu budget rules . " if i take a sober look at it all , i personally am not disappointed , " he told german radio . the two sides are also at odds over the future of the country 's nuclear power plants .
while the previous coalition government of social democrats and greens passed legislation to mothball the sites over the next two decades , the conservatives want to extend their service . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks east for new leadership with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification .

" we will get it done today , " said franz josef jung , the incoming defense minister . he said the two sides had made " a decisive step forward " by reaching agreement thursday on most of the remaining points -lrb- on divergence . -rrb- renate schmidt , who is to become justice minister , said the new government 's program would be ready at 18:00 utc . the eu 's most populous country was forced to pursue an unusual " grand coalition " left-right power-sharing agreement after the general election on sept .
18 failed to produce a governing majority for either of the main parties . a copy of a draft agreement circulating late thursday outlined points of consensus already reached but there were several headings that were stamped " unresolved , " including increases in the value-added tax , a tax on the high-earners , protection against dismissal and phasing out nuclear power .
the text also included an agreement to put off until 2006 any discussion of reforming the creaking public health care system due to the two sides ' starkly differing proposals . the pact must be completed by saturday to allow approval by the rank and file of the two parties at separate congresses next week , paving the way for merkel to be voted in on nov .
22 as the country 's first female chancellor . the talks , designed to lay out a plan of action for the government 's four-year term , have been particularly hard-fought because they bring together bitter rivals from the two sides of germany 's political divide .
going american ?
incoming spd chairman matthias platzeck -lrb- photo -rrb- warned that while some progress had been made , nothing was certain until all the key points had been wrapped up . " there is only an agreement on something when everything is agreed , " platzeck said as he entered a round of negotiations thursday . a leading conservative negotiator , ronald pofalla , said it was unlikely the pact could be finished overnight , or friday .
" prepare for it being saturday , " he told reporters waiting outside the christian democrats ' headquarters in central berlin where the talks were held . after the christian democrats on wednesday touted an agreement on extending the length of trial periods for new employees in a bid to encouraging hiring , outgoing spd leader franz müntefering denied there was any final deal after a late meeting with trade union leaders . the powerful conservative state premier of lower saxony , christian wulff , said the christian democrats would fight for a measure they saw as crucial to reducing the 11 percent jobless rate . " this is not about dismantling employees ' rights but about more opportunities for those out of work , " he said . but trade unions , traditionally close to the spd , warned the move would mark a dangerous step toward a us-style hire-and-fire system in which employees had few protections .
higher vat or wealth tax ?
the second major hurdle to a deal is germany 's dire fiscal situation .
the parties have agreed to attempt to slash a record 35 billion euros -lrb- $ 41 billion -rrb- from the public budget by 2007 to bring down the deficit .
but the parties are at loggerheads over a conservative proposal to hike the value-added tax from 16 percent and an spd bid to impose a tax surcharge on high earners . " those with broad shoulders must carry more than the weak , " platzeck said , saying the so-called " rich tax " was aimed at fostering social justice .
" that is why today 's negotiations are so crucial , " he said . critics have warned that despite the need for austerity , steep tax increases at a time of anemic consumer spending could put the breaks on even meager economic growth , set to reach just 0.8 percent this year and only 1.0 percent next year .
the director of the institute for economic research , ludwig blum , said a vat hike in particular would " send shock waves through the economy . " however , the head of germany 's bdi industry federation , jürgen thumann , welcomed signs of a real attempt to bring the deficit down to conform to eu budget rules . " if i take a sober look at it all , i personally am not disappointed , " he told german radio . the two sides are also at odds over the future of the country 's nuclear power plants .
while the previous coalition government of social democrats and greens passed legislation to mothball the sites over the next two decades , the conservatives want to extend their service . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany looks east for new leadership with angela merkel and matthias platzeck now heading germany 's two main political parties , a new generation brought up in the former communist east is preparing to lead the country 15 years after reunification .

the £ 147m london cycle network plus of radial and orbital routes covering the whole of the city , could be seven years behind schedule , it suggested .
the london assembly report suggests a lack of political will is to blame .
but transport for london -lrb- tfl -rrb- said the project was on target to be finished by 2009/10 and within the set budget .
the london assembly wants a serious commitment from transport for london and the boroughs , and more funding for cycle lanes . "
the project is in danger of drifting well beyond its delivery date " london assembly report the london cycle network -lrb- lcn -rrb- project is being managed by tfl , in partnership with the london borough of camden .
but the report found some boroughs were not taking part and suggested a lack of political will was " a critical obstacle to completion " .
it said some completed schemes had not met tfl 's standards and there was a tendency to focus on finishing easy sections first , which was creating a piecemeal network .
and there are fears it will not be completed until 2016 - seven years late - and will not meet cyclists ' needs .
while recognising the project was making a good contribution to improving cycling conditions , it urged those behind the project to " think bigger " .
its conclusion reads : " the project is in danger of drifting well beyond its delivery date and of not making the dramatic changes that will really excite and encourage cyclists . "
tfl said the lcn was well on target to be completed on time and said the network was well-designed and was already increasing cycling in london .
a tfl spokesman said £ 43m has so far been spent on the first half of the £ 140m lcn project since work began in 2002 .
" there is a great deal of political will to support cycling in london , " he said .
" however , we do need more london boroughs to come on board and to support the mayor 's vision to make london a world class cycling city . "

prosecutors told a court hearing a bail application for one of the men , mirsad mulahalilovic , that the sydney group was gathering material to make a bomb .
mr mulahalilovic bought plastic piping and chemicals were found at his house which could be used in bombs .
but his defence lawyer said the charges were based on " marginal evidence " .
phillip boulten said there was no suggestion the materials would be used for any terrorism related activities .
the sydney court refused bail for mr mulahalilovic , a refugee from bosnia who appeared via video link .
the magistrate said the alleged activities could have created " great disturbance inside this country . "
australia raids sydney : eight men charged with planning a terrorist act omar baladjam also charged with attempted murder for firing at police at least two suspects alleged to have had militant training in pakistan melbourne : nine arrested on charges of being members of a terrorist group abu bakr alleged to be overall leader another suspect , arrested in sydney , to be extradited to melbourne mr mulahalilovic and seven other men arrested in sydney are now due to appear in court on 5 december .
the court also ordered that another man , izzydeen atik , who was arrested on thursday in sydney , be extradited to melbourne .
mr atik was charged with being part of an organisation he knew to be a terrorist group .
' shameful conditions ' defence lawyers said the suspects arrested in sydney would probably plead innocent .
adam houda accused the authorities of holding his clients in " shameful " conditions .
mr boulten said mr mulahalilovic was being kept in solitary confinement , his hands and legs were shackled , and he had limited access to his family .
mr boulten also said mr mulahalilovic was being dressed in orange overalls to emulate the conditions at the us detention centre at guantanamo bay .

joseph stephanides was fired in may for breaching un procurement rules over the iraq programme .
he denies wrongdoing .
the un 's joint disciplinary committee said mr stephanides had been a " sacrificial lamb " and was owed an apology , back pay and reinstatement .

the un administered the oil-for-food programme from 1996 to 2003 , when saddam hussein 's iraq was under sanctions for having invaded kuwait .

by gavin stamp bbc news business reporter dickins & jones is one of several prominent stores closing the contrast could not have been much clearer , even on a dull november day .
just off oxford street in central london , the flagship outlet of h & m was being mobbed by eager shoppers .
the swedish fashion retailer had just unveiled a new clothing range from stella mccartney to feverish demand .
less than half a mile away , however , the scene was very different .
activity at dickins & jones , one of regent street 's oldest and most familiar retail names , was much less frenetic even though the department store has slashed prices on clothes and other goods by 20 % .
dickins & jones , which can trace its roots back to the 1830s , is clearing its stock ahead of closing its doors in january .
' a little bit of everything ' parent company house of fraser opted earlier this year to close the store , saying it had been loss-making since a hefty rent rise in 2002 .
loyal customer derby franks , who has shopped at the store on and off for the past thirty years , is saddened but not surprised at its closure .
department store market share marks & spencer -lrb- excluding food -rrb- : 29.6 % debenhams : 18.6 % john lewis -lrb- excluding waitrose -rrb- : 18.1 % house of fraser : 8.7 % selfridges : 4.6 % harrods : 4.1 % source : verdict - estimated 2005 figures " it does a little bit of everything but nothing awfully well , " she says .
" it is less busy than it was a couple of years ago .
i feel very sad but there is so much choice of shops which must be a good thing . "
the historic store is partly a victim of its prominent location - a high cost base , fierce competition and ever present security worries in london have all exacerbated an already difficult retail climate .
but dickins & jones ' difficulties point to wider problems circling the £ 13bn sector , whose main players include marks & spencer , john lewis and selfridges .
unless department stores can establish their relevance in the modern retail world , sales growth will continue to lag maureen hinton , verdict barkers , another house of fraser store , is also closing in january while the co-op is to shut all of the 34 stores for which it can not find a buyer .
this rationalisation follows the collapse of allders in february which led to the closure of about 20 stores and hundreds of job losses .
retailers are enduring their toughest trading in 15 years but some experts believe the problems facing the sector are more deep-rooted .
" unless department stores can establish their relevance in the modern retail world , sales growth will continue to lag the retail sector , " says maureen hinton , an analyst with retail specialist verdict .
falling sales verdict 's research suggests the sector has lost £ 400m in sales since 2001 while its share of the total retail pie is continuing to decline .
according to hinton , supermarkets are starting to challenge the sector 's traditional ascendancy in " big ticket " home and electrical goods .
bargain hunters say other stores offer better value at the same time , its fashion base has been eroded by a resurgent bhs and a host of specialist and discount fashion retailers such as primark .
" sales are going to specialists on one hand and supermarkets on the other , " she says .
in the face of these threats , the industry is consolidating fast - groups such as jenners and beatties becoming the latest to sell out this year .
the sector 's four largest players - marks & spencer , john lewis , debenhams and house of fraser - now account for 75 % of total sales , giving each significant scale and resources to expand further .
winners and losers according to debenhams ' finance director chris woodhouse , this leaves the sector better placed to fight off competition from other quarters .
" retail markets generally are polarising between winners and losers , " he says .
" department stores are quite complicated animals to run and to do that effectively you need a large scale to support the fixed costs .
" it is no secret that it has got more difficult but we are well set . "
fashion retailers like h & m have taken sales from general stores debenhams currently has plans to open 23 more stores while john lewis plans to add another 10 outlets to its 27-strong portfolio from 2007 .
while closing stores , house of fraser also continues to expand .
while there is no shortage of expansion opportunities - 50 major new shopping centres are due to open by 2010 - experts are sceptical whether firms can grow without having to discard weaker stores .
" when you have a large department store , it requires a lot of money to keep them looking contemporary , " says ms hinton .
" it is a vicious circle .
if you do n't keep the stores looking up to date , you lose footfall and sales and you do n't have the capital to invest .
" what house of fraser is doing - closing unproductive space and moving to more productive space - is a model which others may follow . "
age differential the department store 's core customer remains over 35 and fiercely loyal .
however , it is the key to the more fashion and value-conscious 15-34 age group which m & s and others have been trying to find for some time .
retail experts say the way forward is for stores to add value through careful development of own-label fashion rather than trying to imitate or outmanoeuvre specialist fashion retailers .
" debenhams historically under punched its weight in that 15-34 age group , " admits mr woodhouse , arguing that new ranges from jasper conran and matthew williamson have begun to redress the balance .
however determined their efforts , it seems likely department stores will continue to be undercut by other retailers .
while occasionally shopping for bargains in the likes of dickins & jones and harrods , nicholas forbes says he will continue to buy clothes more cheaply from asda and primark .
" i am not ruthless but price is one of the most important things , " he says .
" i want plain clothes which i can wear for a couple of years and then replace . "
