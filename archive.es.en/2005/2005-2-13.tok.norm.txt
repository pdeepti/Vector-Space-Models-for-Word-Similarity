program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2005 ashes to ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in greece , fire 's acceptable for olympic torches , but not coffins while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .
thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .
despite this , vlassis and his wife haven ’ t given up working for a change to the cremation law .
but if that doesn ’ t happen in time , they ’ re preparing for an alternative : " if i die before my husband , he will have to bring me out of the country for cremation , " susann helms said .

gmt more than one hour into the start of the launch window . the ariane 5 eca placed into geostationary orbit the 3.6-ton xtar-eur satellite , due to provide government and military communications for the united states and spain in a footprint ranging from eastern brazil to singapore . it also released a small dutch satellite , sloshsat , weighing 127 kilograms -lrb- 279 pounds -rrb- to test the dynamics of fluids in orbit .

it does this through microcredits , small loans that can lead to big things . a functioning financial system plays an important roll if one wants to develop a society .
after the international commercial banks , in most developing countries there are also national banks , mostly located in the country 's financial center .
for the most part , these institutions are not interested in lending small amounts to craftsmen or playing a roll in developing a business from the ground up ; it is not profitable enough for them . but since 1992 , the bonn-based savings bank foundation for international cooperation has been working actively to help small credit institutions develop in developing countries . first helping at home soon after german reunification , the foundation got busy in eastern germany .
it was necessary to quickly build up a functioning financial system in the formerly communist german states , so the foundation sent experts to the new states to help manage the transition from a state-run economy to a free-market system . the german initiative was observed with interest by other countries in the former soviet union .
moldova , ukraine , kazakhstan and russia all wanted to build up their micro-credit enterprises that would help to further develop their economies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : antiquated banking in south asia " central and eastern europe is not really an issue anymore , " said peter langkamp , the head of the savings bank foundation .
" we only have one or two projects there and the work , the development of these institutions that we did in the 1990s , is more or less finished . " helping worldwide the foundation operates about 80 projects in about 45 countries .
it has its own capital and is supported by about 300 lending institutions , from state banks to building and loan associations .
according to german law , a public institution like a savings bank has the obligation to use its surpluses for charitable purposes . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helping disaster victims help themselves the savings bank foundation for international cooperation is the only one of more than 570 savings bank foundations in germany to do work beyond the country 's borders .
the projects usually last about two or three years .
then bank managers will be trained to build up the information technology or seek international banks who in turn are already bestowing their local partners credit . because without partners , it does n't work , langkamp said . tsunami victims targeted for the restoration of the area of southeast asia hit by the tsunami , the group has put aside € 100 million -lrb- $ 125 million -rrb- worth of credit , he added .
from a special fund , local institutes for example in sri lanka can give microcredits to small businesses .
those who have lost everything will also be able to access financial support that they normally would not have access to . " we are making sure that that this money in the form of small loans is reaching all layers of society , " langkamp said . monika lohmüller -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de a bank of their own virginia woolf wrote that if a woman is to succeed -lrb- or write fiction -rrb- , she needs money and a room of her own .

gmt more than one hour into the start of the launch window . the ariane 5 eca placed into geostationary orbit the 3.6-ton xtar-eur satellite , due to provide government and military communications for the united states and spain in a footprint ranging from eastern brazil to singapore . it also released a small dutch satellite , sloshsat , weighing 127 kilograms -lrb- 279 pounds -rrb- to test the dynamics of fluids in orbit .
the head of arianespace , jean-yves le gall , described it as " an exceptional moment , " adding that " those who believed in ariane 5 ' 10 tons ' were right .

it veered off course after liftoff and had to be blown up over the atlantic , destroying its half-billion-dollar satellite cargo . a painstaking inquiry into the 2002 disaster pinned the blame on a cooling system in the eca 's vulcain-2 motor , an upgraded version of the vulcain-1 engine that powers the standard 6.8-tonne ariane 5 . a lucrative market backed by pledges of € 550 million -lrb- $ 715 million -rrb- from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- stakeholder nations , a program was initiated to fix the problem . more than € 500 million and europe 's bid to rival the united states and russia in the lucrative market for satellite launches was riding on the latest rocket . the european aeronautics and space giant eads has a 27.03-percent stake in arianespace , which operates and markets the ariane range of launchers designed by the esa . the commercial interest in the eca is productivity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2005 ashes to ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in greece , fire 's acceptable for olympic torches , but not coffins while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .
thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .
despite this , vlassis and his wife haven ’ t given up working for a change to the cremation law .
but if that doesn ’ t happen in time , they ’ re preparing for an alternative : " if i die before my husband , he will have to bring me out of the country for cremation , " susann helms said .

we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2005 ashes to ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in greece , fire 's acceptable for olympic torches , but not coffins while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .
thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .
despite this , vlassis and his wife haven ’ t given up working for a change to the cremation law .
but if that doesn ’ t happen in time , they ’ re preparing for an alternative : " if i die before my husband , he will have to bring me out of the country for cremation , " susann helms said .

traces of the militarily dubious decision to bomb the city remain visible today . on the evening of feb .
13 , 1945 , nine mosquito fighter planes and 244 lancaster bombers from the royal air force 's 5th fleet took off from their base in the south of england .
dresden 's air raid sirens started to wail at 9:39 p.m.
around 20 minutes later the first target-marking bombs fell on the stadium just outside of the city center .
the first air raid lasted about 30 minutes and was so dense that the entire inner city was engulfed by a firestorm . " there , between exploded trams , i saw the first scorched dead , charred , shrunken , some of them just brushed by the flames but still asphyxiated , " a soldier recounted .
" women , children , men - the horrible death had taken them all . " the allies did n't just attack dresden to break the civilians ' morale ; the idea was also to cut off communication lines to the front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august schreitmüller 's sandstone sculpture " the goodness " from the townhall tower overlooking the city in 1945 and 2005 the second air attack took place between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. on feb .
14 .
more than 500 planes bombed 15 square kilometers -lrb- 9 square miles -rrb- of the city .
all told , 650,000 firebombs , air mines and 1,800 demolition bombs were dropped on dresden in the first two air raids .
they totally destroyed the densely inhabited historic city center , mainly hitting residential buildings , churches , offices and museums . " our house was hit many times during the second attack , " a survivor said .
" we all threw ourselves on the floor and my husband said , ' it 's burning , it smells like fire . '
and he opened the first door and the flames were already blazing .
there was nothing to do to save our lives but run through the flames . " strategic after all ? the military 's albertstadt , the industrial areas and the airport where barracks were located , remained largely untouched .
in the next raid , around noon , the us air force targeted the transportation infrastructure . though the bombing of dresden has for years generally been viewed merely as pointless destruction , british historian frederick taylor claimed that the city was strategically important after all .
taylor 's book " dresden : february 13 , 1945 " has caused controversy in the city itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in 1945 " there was a train junction , a garrison , troops came and went as in any other german city near the front , " taylor said .
" the english planners wanted to prevent the replenishment of supplies to the eastern front .
the attack was not exclusively directed against dresden ; it was also against chemnitz and berlin . " but similarly large carpet bomb attacks on chemnitz , plauen or leipzig killed far fewer people , because thousands of people had taken refuge in dresden at the time of the air raids .
though there 's no way knowing exactly how many people died , the official death toll is 35,000 , and the city has become a symbol of world war ii aerial warfare . raids saved jews aside from the suffering and destruction they caused , the air raids saved the last 175 dresden jews .
on the morning of feb .
13 , orders were dispatched to deport them .
during the bombing though , many of the jews were able to go underground , including the family of heinz joachim aris , today head of saxony state 's jewish community . bildunterschrift : a combo of two photos shows the inner courtyard at the zwinger art galleries in central dresden lying in ruins slightly more than a year after the allied firebombing in a file photo taken march 12 , 1946 , left , and a similar view of the same wing of the building being under restoration on thursday , feb .
10 , 2005 " i was born in dresden and this city 's ruin and the endless suffering of many innocent citizens was dreadful , " aris said .
" one must simply see it in the context of cause and effect . " for , aris added , the semper synagogue was burned down on nov .
9 , 1938 , and six years later the entire city followed .
the dresden inferno was part and parcel of a horrible war that included the destruction of cities like rotterdam , coventry and leningrad . dresden 's residents showed an immense willingness to rebuild their devastated home after the war .
their determination is exemplified by the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , the church of our lady .
for nearly 50 years , the church 's ruins evoked destruction and death . but after german reunification in 1990 , the frauenkirche was rebuilt thanks to generous donations - also from the partnership with the city of coventry .
the new cross atop the church was donated by britain 's " dresden trust " and forged by the son of one of the bomber pilots . wolfram nagel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden - a city risen from the ashes looking back on dresden 's historical development , it is remarkable that the city has recovered and developed into a thriving metropolis in the economically deprived region of eastern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2005 ashes to ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in greece , fire 's acceptable for olympic torches , but not coffins while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .
thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .
despite this , vlassis and his wife haven ’ t given up working for a change to the cremation law .
but if that doesn ’ t happen in time , they ’ re preparing for an alternative : " if i die before my husband , he will have to bring me out of the country for cremation , " susann helms said .

thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .
despite this , vlassis and his wife haven ’ t given up working for a change to the cremation law .
but if that doesn ’ t happen in time , they ’ re preparing for an alternative : " if i die before my husband , he will have to bring me out of the country for cremation , " susann helms said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2005 ashes to ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in greece , fire 's acceptable for olympic torches , but not coffins while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .
thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2005 ashes to ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in greece , fire 's acceptable for olympic torches , but not coffins while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .
thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated .

thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .
despite this , vlassis and his wife haven ’ t given up working for a change to the cremation law .
but if that doesn ’ t happen in time , they ’ re preparing for an alternative : " if i die before my husband , he will have to bring me out of the country for cremation , " susann helms said .

gmt more than one hour into the start of the launch window . the ariane 5 eca placed into geostationary orbit the 3.6-ton xtar-eur satellite , due to provide government and military communications for the united states and spain in a footprint ranging from eastern brazil to singapore . it also released a small dutch satellite , sloshsat , weighing 127 kilograms -lrb- 279 pounds -rrb- to test the dynamics of fluids in orbit .
the head of arianespace , jean-yves le gall , described it as " an exceptional moment , " adding that " those who believed in ariane 5 ' 10 tons ' were right .

it veered off course after liftoff and had to be blown up over the atlantic , destroying its half-billion-dollar satellite cargo . a painstaking inquiry into the 2002 disaster pinned the blame on a cooling system in the eca 's vulcain-2 motor , an upgraded version of the vulcain-1 engine that powers the standard 6.8-tonne ariane 5 . a lucrative market backed by pledges of € 550 million -lrb- $ 715 million -rrb- from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- stakeholder nations , a program was initiated to fix the problem . more than € 500 million and europe 's bid to rival the united states and russia in the lucrative market for satellite launches was riding on the latest rocket . the european aeronautics and space giant eads has a 27.03-percent stake in arianespace , which operates and markets the ariane range of launchers designed by the esa . the commercial interest in the eca is productivity .
a launch costs about € 150 million , so if two or three satellites can be launched in one go , the costs per satellite are far cheaper than with a single payload . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blast-off for new ariane super rocket the countdown has begun for the launch of the new ariane 5 eca : the new model , which is capable of transporting ten tons of cargo , will power up into the sky on saturday .

gmt more than one hour into the start of the launch window . the ariane 5 eca placed into geostationary orbit the 3.6-ton xtar-eur satellite , due to provide government and military communications for the united states and spain in a footprint ranging from eastern brazil to singapore . it also released a small dutch satellite , sloshsat , weighing 127 kilograms -lrb- 279 pounds -rrb- to test the dynamics of fluids in orbit .
the head of arianespace , jean-yves le gall , described it as " an exceptional moment , " adding that " those who believed in ariane 5 ' 10 tons ' were right . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ariane 5 rocket lifts off in kourou , french guiana on saturday the first version of the ariane 5 eca failed catastrophically on its maiden flight in december 2002 .
it veered off course after liftoff and had to be blown up over the atlantic , destroying its half-billion-dollar satellite cargo . a painstaking inquiry into the 2002 disaster pinned the blame on a cooling system in the eca 's vulcain-2 motor , an upgraded version of the vulcain-1 engine that powers the standard 6.8-tonne ariane 5 . a lucrative market backed by pledges of € 550 million -lrb- $ 715 million -rrb- from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- stakeholder nations , a program was initiated to fix the problem . more than € 500 million and europe 's bid to rival the united states and russia in the lucrative market for satellite launches was riding on the latest rocket . the european aeronautics and space giant eads has a 27.03-percent stake in arianespace , which operates and markets the ariane range of launchers designed by the esa . the commercial interest in the eca is productivity .
a launch costs about € 150 million , so if two or three satellites can be launched in one go , the costs per satellite are far cheaper than with a single payload . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blast-off for new ariane super rocket the countdown has begun for the launch of the new ariane 5 eca : the new model , which is capable of transporting ten tons of cargo , will power up into the sky on saturday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 13.02.2005 ashes to ashes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in greece , fire 's acceptable for olympic torches , but not coffins while some aspects of eu life become increasingly harmonized , funeral rights across the union still vary enormously .
thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .
despite this , vlassis and his wife haven ’ t given up working for a change to the cremation law .
but if that doesn ’ t happen in time , they ’ re preparing for an alternative : " if i die before my husband , he will have to bring me out of the country for cremation , " susann helms said .

thus far , cremation in greece is impossible . sografou is one of the biggest cemeteries in athens .
like many others in the city , it is so overcrowded that the dead do n't have much chance to rest in peace .
three years after burial , the bodies are exhumed to make space for the next coffin .
georgos vlassis , a 65-year-old pensioner , said he remembers vividly how he had to attend the exhumation of his father . " i think it ’ s the worst thing that can happen to a body , " he said .
" the corpse was exhumed , but it had not totally decomposed .
for me and my relatives who had to attend the exhumation it was a traumatic experience .
it convinced me that cremation would be the best solution both for the dead and for the grieving relatives . " traumatic experience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens : a crowded city with crowded cemetaries opening graves and breaking up the coffin is part of the daily routine for athens cemetery workers .
they are quite used to seeing body parts of the corpses that have not fully decomposed , but for the relatives who witness it , it ’ s often a shock .
angela daskalaki , head of the athens cemetery , said there are many factors which hinder decomposition . " it depends on the quality of the earth and on the clothes the dead are wearing , " she said .
" nylon for example is very bad .
and it depends on whether there are still traces of medication in the body of the deceased . " vlassis said he knows about the problems of decomposition and condemns the process of treating corpses with strong chemicals following exhumation . " it is barbaric , " he said .
" when i die i don ’ t want my body to be treated like that .
i want to be cremated .
that would be really the end . " mounting pressure vlassis and his wife , susann helms , settled in athens just a few years ago .
they ’ re still in good health and enjoying life , but they are looking ahead and have joined a small pressure group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a coffin is cremated at a hamburg cemetary " i come from australia where my parents and grandparents were cremated , " susann helms said .
" that is a tradition in our family .
when i heard that cremation is not allowed in greece , i joined a committee to press the government to allow the construction of a cremation center . ” that was a few years ago , at a time when the socialists still held the reins of power in greece and were promising to pass new legislation .
but it never happened because the socialists were afraid of the greek orthodox church , which condemns cremation as unorthodox .
the church is still a very strong force in greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greek orthodox monks " according to our faith , burning is an act of violence against the body , " father nikolaos hatzinikolaos of the greek orthodox church said .
" look at nature : it always leaves some remains after the biological end of a corpse .
these remains show us that the path has not come to a final end .
we believe that man does not come to an end , but that man goes on living . " politics at play but vlassis said he doesn ’ t believe that the church opposes cremation purely for religious reasons .
theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .
nor , said vlassis , does the greek church in canada .
he said he believes that in greece , the reasons for this opposition are purely political . " for the church , it ’ s just a demonstration of their power , " he said .
" they oppose legislation that would allow cremation because that would be a symbol of their diminishing influence in society .
they want the government to be in fear of the church . " for half a year now the conservatives have been in government .
athens mayor dora bakoyannis , an influential conservative politician , is a strong supporter of a crematorium being opened . " we fully support the building of a crematorium in athens , " she said .
" it would help ease overcrowding in the cemeteries and it would meet the wishes of many people who would prefer to be cremated . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : historic urns at europe 's first crematory in gotha in eastern germany but the most conservatives have a different opinion or choose not to go against the views of the greek orthodox church .
so , as with the last government , there seems to be little chance of new legislation in the immediate future .
despite this , vlassis and his wife haven ’ t given up working for a change to the cremation law .
but if that doesn ’ t happen in time , they ’ re preparing for an alternative : " if i die before my husband , he will have to bring me out of the country for cremation , " susann helms said .

theologically , cremation is not an orthodox dogma , he said .
for example , the russian , serb and bulgarian orthodox churches have no objections to cremation .

traces of the militarily dubious decision to bomb the city remain visible today . on the evening of feb .
13 , 1945 , nine mosquito fighter planes and 244 lancaster bombers from the royal air force 's 5th fleet took off from their base in the south of england .
dresden 's air raid sirens started to wail at 9:39 p.m.
around 20 minutes later the first target-marking bombs fell on the stadium just outside of the city center .
the first air raid lasted about 30 minutes and was so dense that the entire inner city was engulfed by a firestorm . " there , between exploded trams , i saw the first scorched dead , charred , shrunken , some of them just brushed by the flames but still asphyxiated , " a soldier recounted .
" women , children , men - the horrible death had taken them all . " the allies did n't just attack dresden to break the civilians ' morale ; the idea was also to cut off communication lines to the front . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : august schreitmüller 's sandstone sculpture " the goodness " from the townhall tower overlooking the city in 1945 and 2005 the second air attack took place between 1 a.m. and 2 a.m. on feb .
14 .
more than 500 planes bombed 15 square kilometers -lrb- 9 square miles -rrb- of the city .
all told , 650,000 firebombs , air mines and 1,800 demolition bombs were dropped on dresden in the first two air raids .
they totally destroyed the densely inhabited historic city center , mainly hitting residential buildings , churches , offices and museums . " our house was hit many times during the second attack , " a survivor said .
" we all threw ourselves on the floor and my husband said , ' it 's burning , it smells like fire . '
and he opened the first door and the flames were already blazing .
there was nothing to do to save our lives but run through the flames . " strategic after all ? the military 's albertstadt , the industrial areas and the airport where barracks were located , remained largely untouched .
in the next raid , around noon , the us air force targeted the transportation infrastructure . though the bombing of dresden has for years generally been viewed merely as pointless destruction , british historian frederick taylor claimed that the city was strategically important after all .
taylor 's book " dresden : february 13 , 1945 " has caused controversy in the city itself . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the frauenkirche in 1945 " there was a train junction , a garrison , troops came and went as in any other german city near the front , " taylor said .
" the english planners wanted to prevent the replenishment of supplies to the eastern front .
the attack was not exclusively directed against dresden ; it was also against chemnitz and berlin . " but similarly large carpet bomb attacks on chemnitz , plauen or leipzig killed far fewer people , because thousands of people had taken refuge in dresden at the time of the air raids .
though there 's no way knowing exactly how many people died , the official death toll is 35,000 , and the city has become a symbol of world war ii aerial warfare . raids saved jews aside from the suffering and destruction they caused , the air raids saved the last 175 dresden jews .
on the morning of feb .
13 , orders were dispatched to deport them .
during the bombing though , many of the jews were able to go underground , including the family of heinz joachim aris , today head of saxony state 's jewish community . bildunterschrift : a combo of two photos shows the inner courtyard at the zwinger art galleries in central dresden lying in ruins slightly more than a year after the allied firebombing in a file photo taken march 12 , 1946 , left , and a similar view of the same wing of the building being under restoration on thursday , feb .
10 , 2005 " i was born in dresden and this city 's ruin and the endless suffering of many innocent citizens was dreadful , " aris said .
" one must simply see it in the context of cause and effect . " for , aris added , the semper synagogue was burned down on nov .
9 , 1938 , and six years later the entire city followed .
the dresden inferno was part and parcel of a horrible war that included the destruction of cities like rotterdam , coventry and leningrad . dresden 's residents showed an immense willingness to rebuild their devastated home after the war .
their determination is exemplified by the reconstruction of the frauenkirche , the church of our lady .
for nearly 50 years , the church 's ruins evoked destruction and death . but after german reunification in 1990 , the frauenkirche was rebuilt thanks to generous donations - also from the partnership with the city of coventry .
the new cross atop the church was donated by britain 's " dresden trust " and forged by the son of one of the bomber pilots . wolfram nagel -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dresden - a city risen from the ashes looking back on dresden 's historical development , it is remarkable that the city has recovered and developed into a thriving metropolis in the economically deprived region of eastern germany .

it will be asked to start the process that could soon see women chosen as bishops for the first time in england .
it will again be debating whether to allow gay and lesbian christians to work as priests .
the forthcoming royal wedding will be up for discussion and many synod members will want to pronounce on the forthcoming royal wedding , though calls for an emergency debate have been rejected .
their concern over the decision of prince charles and camilla parker bowles to marry stems from his presumed future role as supreme governor of the church of england , one of the monarch 's traditional titles .
leaving aside the prince 's own matrimonial history , mrs parker bowles , as a divorcee whose partner is still alive , is not eligible to remarry , according to the church 's rules .
and although the couple plan a civil wedding , to be followed by a blessing by the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , some synod members believe the marriage will leave charles unfit to head the church .
divisive issue a vociferous debate is likely on women bishops , accepted for years in many other parts of the worldwide anglican communion , but restricted in england to serving only as priests .
members will spend much of their three-day meeting discussing a working party report on the issue , and then debate whether to hold another debate in july on actually going ahead .
christina rees : ' crunch time ' for rowan williams one synod member , christina rees , a religious commentator , told the bbc news website : " a minority of synod members do n't even want to discuss the report , but i think it will be accepted .
" then we 'll have a messy few months till july , with those opposing the idea very busy - they may argue they should be able to opt out if we do get women bishops .
" but there 's research showing 85 % of ordinary church members are very happy with the idea .
and only four out of 43 diocesan bishops oppose it , so i think it will go ahead in july . "
search for solutions the synod will spend much of its last day debating the report of a group chaired by the archbishop of armagh , dr robin eames , published last october .
the group was set up to try to resolve the increasingly bitter dispute within global anglicanism following the consecration of a gay bishop in the us , and agreement on services to bless same-sex unions in canada .
another stage in that dispute will unfold when the world 's anglican primates -lrb- archbishops and other national church leaders -rrb- meet in northern ireland from 21 to 25 february to study dr eames ' report .
christina rees said : " there 's been no shift in position in the synod on the report .
it will have the effect of being a warm-up show for the main event , the primates ' meeting .
" but people will be watching rowan williams , who 's faced with what to do in ireland .
this is a crunch time for him . "
other debates include terms of service for the clergy , including the possibility of ending the freehold which virtually guarantees many a job for life , and environmental problems .

it will be asked to start the process that could soon see women chosen as bishops for the first time in england .
it will again be debating whether to allow gay and lesbian christians to work as priests .
the forthcoming royal wedding will be up for discussion and many synod members will want to pronounce on the forthcoming royal wedding , though calls for an emergency debate have been rejected .
their concern over the decision of prince charles and camilla parker bowles to marry stems from his presumed future role as supreme governor of the church of england , one of the monarch 's traditional titles .
leaving aside the prince 's own matrimonial history , mrs parker bowles , as a divorcee whose partner is still alive , is not eligible to remarry , according to the church 's rules .
and although the couple plan a civil wedding , to be followed by a blessing by the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , some synod members believe the marriage will leave charles unfit to head the church .
divisive issue a vociferous debate is likely on women bishops , accepted for years in many other parts of the worldwide anglican communion , but restricted in england to serving only as priests .
members will spend much of their three-day meeting discussing a working party report on the issue , and then debate whether to hold another debate in july on actually going ahead .
christina rees : ' crunch time ' for rowan williams one synod member , christina rees , a religious commentator , told the bbc news website : " a minority of synod members do n't even want to discuss the report , but i think it will be accepted .
" then we 'll have a messy few months till july , with those opposing the idea very busy - they may argue they should be able to opt out if we do get women bishops .
" but there 's research showing 85 % of ordinary church members are very happy with the idea .
and only four out of 43 diocesan bishops oppose it , so i think it will go ahead in july . "
search for solutions the synod will spend much of its last day debating the report of a group chaired by the archbishop of armagh , dr robin eames , published last october .
the group was set up to try to resolve the increasingly bitter dispute within global anglicanism following the consecration of a gay bishop in the us , and agreement on services to bless same-sex unions in canada .
another stage in that dispute will unfold when the world 's anglican primates -lrb- archbishops and other national church leaders -rrb- meet in northern ireland from 21 to 25 february to study dr eames ' report .
christina rees said : " there 's been no shift in position in the synod on the report .
it will have the effect of being a warm-up show for the main event , the primates ' meeting .
" but people will be watching rowan williams , who 's faced with what to do in ireland .

it will be asked to start the process that could soon see women chosen as bishops for the first time in england .
it will again be debating whether to allow gay and lesbian christians to work as priests .
and many synod members will want to pronounce on the forthcoming royal wedding , though calls for an emergency debate have been rejected .
their concern over the decision of prince charles and camilla parker bowles to marry stems from his presumed future role as supreme governor of the church of england , one of the monarch 's traditional titles .
leaving aside the prince 's own matrimonial history , mrs parker bowles , as a divorcee whose partner is still alive , is not eligible to remarry , according to the church 's rules .
and although the couple plan a civil wedding , to be followed by a blessing by the archbishop of canterbury , dr rowan williams , some synod members believe the marriage will leave charles unfit to head the church .
divisive issue a vociferous debate is likely on women bishops , accepted for years in many other parts of the worldwide anglican communion , but restricted in england to serving only as priests .
members will spend much of their three-day meeting discussing a working party report on the issue , and then debate whether to hold another debate in july on actually going ahead .
one synod member , christina rees , a religious commentator , told the bbc news website : " a minority of synod members do n't even want to discuss the report , but i think it will be accepted .
" then we 'll have a messy few months till july , with those opposing the idea very busy - they may argue they should be able to opt out if we do get women bishops .
" but there 's research showing 85 % of ordinary church members are very happy with the idea .
and only four out of 43 diocesan bishops oppose it , so i think it will go ahead in july . "
search for solutions the synod will spend much of its last day debating the report of a group chaired by the archbishop of armagh , dr robin eames , published last october .
the group was set up to try to resolve the increasingly bitter dispute within global anglicanism following the consecration of a gay bishop in the us , and agreement on services to bless same-sex unions in canada .
another stage in that dispute will unfold when the world 's anglican primates -lrb- archbishops and other national church leaders -rrb- meet in northern ireland from 21 to 25 february to study dr eames ' report .
christina rees said : " there 's been no shift in position in the synod on the report .
it will have the effect of being a warm-up show for the main event , the primates ' meeting .
" but people will be watching rowan williams , who 's faced with what to do in ireland .
this is a crunch time for him . "
other debates include terms of service for the clergy , including the possibility of ending the freehold which virtually guarantees many a job for life , and environmental problems .

luke mitchell was sentenced on friday to a minimum of 20 years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend jodi in june 2003 at dalkeith , midlothian .
judge lord nimmo smith said his manson fascination could have been a factor .
but the singer told the sunday mail it was " all about " mitchell 's upbringing and not " putting blame elsewhere " .

what i do know is that it is all about the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive , not putting the blame elsewhere " marilyn manson lord nimmo smith said he could not ignore the similarities between the injuries inflicted on jodi and those in manson 's paintings of elizabeth short .
the would-be hollywood actress was killed in 1947 in what became known as the black dahlia murder .
" i think that you carried an image of the paintings in your memory when you killed jodi , " he told mitchell .
manson told the sunday mail newspaper he had heard of the jodi case but did not want to " give it too much publicity " .
" what i do know is that it is all about the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive , not putting the blame elsewhere , " he said .
' mental damage ' the trial heard evidence of mitchell 's cannabis use and the judge said he did not consider it a harmless recreational drug .
" i believe that in some instances at least it can seriously damage the mental processes of those who habitually consume drugs , " he said .
" in your case i think that it may well have contributed to your being unable to make the distinction between fantasy and reality which is essential for normal moral judgments . "
he also said he could not dismiss mitchell 's fascination with satanism as " mere adolescent rebellion " .
" i think that is a sign that you found evil attractive and that you thought that there might be a kind of perverted glamour in doing something wicked , " he said .
defence qc donald findlay said the fight to clear mitchell 's name would continue .
he told the court : " so long as that young man maintains to me he did not kill jodi the fight to clear his name will go on . "

luke mitchell was sentenced on friday to a minimum of 20 years in prison for the murder of his girlfriend jodi in june 2003 at dalkeith , midlothian .
judge lord nimmo smith said his manson fascination could have been a factor .
but the singer told the sunday mail it was " all about " mitchell 's upbringing and not " putting blame elsewhere " .
' similar injuries ' jodi was stripped , tied up and stabbed to death in woods near her home , the high court in edinburgh heard .
what i do know is that it is all about the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive , not putting the blame elsewhere marilyn manson lord nimmo smith said he could not ignore the similarities between the injuries inflicted on jodi and those in manson 's paintings of elizabeth short .
the would-be hollywood actress was killed in 1947 in what became known as the black dahlia murder .
" i think that you carried an image of the paintings in your memory when you killed jodi , " he told mitchell .
manson told the sunday mail newspaper he had heard of the jodi case but did not want to " give it too much publicity " .
" what i do know is that it is all about the education that parents give their children and the influences they receive , not putting the blame elsewhere , " he said .
' mental damage ' the trial heard evidence of mitchell 's cannabis use and the judge said he did not consider it a harmless recreational drug .
" i believe that in some instances at least it can seriously damage the mental processes of those who habitually consume drugs , " he said .
" in your case i think that it may well have contributed to your being unable to make the distinction between fantasy and reality which is essential for normal moral judgments . "
he also said he could not dismiss mitchell 's fascination with satanism as " mere adolescent rebellion " .
" i think that is a sign that you found evil attractive and that you thought that there might be a kind of perverted glamour in doing something wicked , " he said .

sister helen prejean also told bbc radio scotland 's sunday live programme that the 40-year-old should be recompensed for his 18 years in prison .
richey 's conviction for killing a child in a fire was quashed last month .
sister prejean said : " the people who withheld evidence or who distorted evidence should be held accountable . "
she added : " the state ought to recompense people with whom they make mistakes and cost them 18 years of their lives .
" how can you really compensate somebody who has been tortured ?
i hope to further the discourse among the american people , who basically are decent people , decent as the people in scotland and really no more vengeful sister helen prejean " do you say sorry , issue an apology - money wo n't do it either .
but at least it would be a good face to just say ' we made a mistake ' .
" however , they are not going to do that for the very same reason that the prosecutors in the state are not going to admit that they got it wrong . "
richey , who is in jail in ohio , was found guilty in 1987 of killing his ex-girlfriend 's daughter , cynthia collins , in the town of columbus grove in 1986 .
but a three-judge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals ruled in january that his trial was flawed .
murder victims the attorney general wants the case to be reheard by the entire circuit and is seeking more time to prepare his case .
sister prejean wrote about her experiences visiting a prisoner on death row in a book entitled dead man walking : an eyewitness account of the death penalty in the united states .
that became the inspiration for the 1995 film dead man walking , featuring death row prisoner matthew poncelet , played by sean penn .
he was alone except for the comfort of catholic nun , sister prejean , played by susan sarandon .
sister prejean has witnessed five executions in louisiana and today she educates the public about the death penalty by lecturing and writing .
kenny richey has spent 18 years on death row in ohio as the founder of survive , a victim 's advocacy group in new orleans , she continues to counsel not only inmates on death row but the families of murder victims as well .
sister prejean said : " we have 117 wrongfully convicted people off death row and to this day the prosecutors of the state are yet to offer an apology .
" i hope to further the discourse among the american people , who basically are decent people , decent as the people in scotland and really no more vengeful .
" however , they are terribly uneducated and they kind of live in a bubble and do n't know what 's going on . "
the nun believes that for politicians the death penalty is an expedient device for winning support .
' bully on the block ' they are " allowing people to be killed in order to advance their political positions " , said sister prejean .
she has insisted that politicians take the death penalty " off the table " and look to an evolved europe on how to go forward .
sister prejean said her country is still young and remains the " bully on the block " where " beating up and using violence " are accepted .
the interview was broadcast in full on 13 february during the sunday live programme on radio scotland .

information commissioner kevin dunion revealed the figure as he prepared to launch a public awareness campaign about the freedom of information act .
mr dunion said research has shown that only about 30 % of people in scotland have heard of the act .
the right to know campaign would seek to address the shortfall , he said .
speaking on bbc radio scotland 's sunday live programme , mr dunion said : " the purpose of the legislation is to allow anybody , anywhere to ask scotland 's public authorities for information .
" we know from research that we 've carried out that only about 30 % of people have definitely heard of the act and even then they 're not entirely sure of what they can do in terms of using those rights .
we ca n't put the genie back in the bottle .
the freedom of information act in scotland gives people an absolute right to information held by scotland 's public authorities kevin dunion information commissioner " the whole purpose of the right to know campaign is to explain , in plain english , what the freedom of information act is all about , what kind of information you can get and from which authorities . "
the act applies to the scottish executive and its agencies , local authorities , nhs scotland , schools , colleges and universities , the police and the scottish parliament .
other bodies can be added to the list in the future .
mr dunion said individuals can apply for any information from public authorities and it would then be up to those bodies to provide it or provide a clear and justifiable case for refusing to do so .
it is his job to enforce the public 's rights and adjudicate in contentious cases .
the commissioner said the publicity campaign was geared towards increasing public confidence in the new system and encouraging people to seek information on the " bread and butter issues " that affect their lives .
the new law came into effect on 1 january this year he rejected a calls for the act to be suspended during election campaigning to stop dirty tricks campaigns by parties .
former prime minister john major called for a moratorium around election time after controversy over the release of papers on black wednesday in 1992 , when britain crashed out of the exchange rate mechanism .
mr dunion said : " there is no going back on this .
we ca n't put the genie back in the bottle .
the freedom of information act in scotland gives people an absolute right to information held by scotland 's public authorities .
" we ca n't on a weekly or monthly basis decide whether or not to suspend that right .
" the act applies not just to central government but to local authorities , the police , right down to individual gps and dentists .
" there is no way they can suspend the act on an arbitrary basis and we should remember of course that the freedom of information scotland is entirely separate from the english act , so his comments have no bearing whatsoever . "
the interview was broadcast in full on 13 february during the sunday live programme on radio scotland .
