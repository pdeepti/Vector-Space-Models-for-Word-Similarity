dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .
if used properly , they can fill the gap .
each of these are eco-friendly . - syed ajaz , kashmir , india compiled by dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hurricane katrina causes jitters in europe hurricane katrina , currently pummelling the us , is sending shock waves over to europe too .

there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .
if used properly , they can fill the gap .
each of these are eco-friendly . - syed ajaz , kashmir , india compiled by dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hurricane katrina causes jitters in europe hurricane katrina , currently pummelling the us , is sending shock waves over to europe too .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .
if used properly , they can fill the gap .
each of these are eco-friendly . - syed ajaz , kashmir , india compiled by dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hurricane katrina causes jitters in europe hurricane katrina , currently pummelling the us , is sending shock waves over to europe too .

" the american president has closed his eyes to the economic and human damage that natural catastrophes such as katrina - in other words , disasters caused by a lack of climate protection measures - can visit on his country , " trittin wrote . bildunterschrift : people wade through floodwaters in new orleans and he did n't stop there . " when reason finally reaches the headquarters of the climate polluters , the international community will need to be able to extend a hand with an elaborate proposal for the future of international climate protection .
the german government stands ready for this , " he added . a n gry america n s americans , who are already reeling from the horror of what is happening in louisiana , have reacted in fury to what they see as cold callous remarks , which leave no doubt that anti-american sentiment is rife in a nation which claims to be its " friend " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de reader response -pipe- 02.09.2005 is germany exploiting katrina ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : katrina 's victims still wait for help hurricane katrina has devastated large parts of new orleans and the adjacent gulf coast region .
dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .

how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .

the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .

the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .

on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .

" the american president has closed his eyes to the economic and human damage that natural catastrophes such as katrina - in other words , disasters caused by a lack of climate protection measures - can visit on his country , " trittin wrote . bildunterschrift : people wade through floodwaters in new orleans and he did n't stop there . " when reason finally reaches the headquarters of the climate polluters , the international community will need to be able to extend a hand with an elaborate proposal for the future of international climate protection .
the german government stands ready for this , " he added . a n gry america n s americans , who are already reeling from the horror of what is happening in louisiana , have reacted in fury to what they see as cold callous remarks , which leave no doubt that anti-american sentiment is rife in a nation which claims to be its " friend " . " in the wake of the december 2004 tsunami would germans have jumped at the chance to criticize indonesia for its habit of condoning islamic terrorism ?
would germans have self-righteously stated that those victims had it coming ? " one dw-world reader asked .
" no , it seems germany only feels a " moral " obligation to attack the united states at every possible opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casino wreckage litters the landscape " the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv , " dw-world reader werner bauder wrote . offer of help too late ? germany has now offered to help , and chancellor gerhard schröder expressed his sympathy for those affected by the disaster , a sentiment he said was shared by the german people .
but that is not enough for some us citizens who feel the sharpness of trittin 's words leaves no doubt that germany is lacking in compassion . bildunterschrift : waiting to be rescued many americans who responded to the environment minister 's comments , are also outraged at the suggestion that there is any significant link between the disaster and the us administration 's failure to sign the kyoto climate treaty . " i think you are blinded by your obsession with conservation , " another reader stated .
" you fail to see that the increased destruction from hurricanes is also the result of more population living along the coastal regions and thus there are more buildings to be destroyed compared to 100 years ago . " bad timi n g karsten voigt , who co-ordinates us-german relations at the foreign ministry , told the washi n gto n post that trittin 's remarks were ill-timed , but defended the substance . " at this very moment our solidarity and condolences should be at the forefront , " he said .
" beyond that it is naturally clear that there will be a discussion at some point about whether the climate change has increased the damage that is related to such hurricanes .

" the american president has closed his eyes to the economic and human damage that natural catastrophes such as katrina - in other words , disasters caused by a lack of climate protection measures - can visit on his country , " trittin wrote . bildunterschrift : people wade through floodwaters in new orleans and he did n't stop there . " when reason finally reaches the headquarters of the climate polluters , the international community will need to be able to extend a hand with an elaborate proposal for the future of international climate protection .
the german government stands ready for this , " he added . a n gry america n s americans , who are already reeling from the horror of what is happening in louisiana , have reacted in fury to what they see as cold callous remarks , which leave no doubt that anti-american sentiment is rife in a nation which claims to be its " friend " . " in the wake of the december 2004 tsunami would germans have jumped at the chance to criticize indonesia for its habit of condoning islamic terrorism ?
would germans have self-righteously stated that those victims had it coming ? " one dw-world reader asked .
" no , it seems germany only feels a " moral " obligation to attack the united states at every possible opportunity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : casino wreckage litters the landscape " the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv , " dw-world reader werner bauder wrote . offer of help too late ? germany has now offered to help , and chancellor gerhard schröder expressed his sympathy for those affected by the disaster , a sentiment he said was shared by the german people .
but that is not enough for some us citizens who feel the sharpness of trittin 's words leaves no doubt that germany is lacking in compassion . bildunterschrift : waiting to be rescued many americans who responded to the environment minister 's comments , are also outraged at the suggestion that there is any significant link between the disaster and the us administration 's failure to sign the kyoto climate treaty . " i think you are blinded by your obsession with conservation , " another reader stated .
" you fail to see that the increased destruction from hurricanes is also the result of more population living along the coastal regions and thus there are more buildings to be destroyed compared to 100 years ago . " bad timi n g karsten voigt , who co-ordinates us-german relations at the foreign ministry , told the washi n gto n post that trittin 's remarks were ill-timed , but defended the substance . " at this very moment our solidarity and condolences should be at the forefront , " he said .
" beyond that it is naturally clear that there will be a discussion at some point about whether the climate change has increased the damage that is related to such hurricanes .
in the aftermath , there will be a new debate about origins , causes and solutions . " bildunterschrift : a home sits destroyed a spokesman for trittin said he had not intended to be insensitive to those caught up in katrina , adding that the extent of the hurricane was not known at the time the piece went to press .
and although the german government has now pledged to offer its full support to the us in its rescue operations , trittin has refused to back down from his comments . dw staff -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany offers oil reserves , supplies to us while the aftermath of hurricane katrina has become an election issue in germany , chancellor gerhard schröder announced friday he would support releasing oil reserves to ease the situation .

but as the entries in his blog 's politics category continued grow , he realized they could sustain a blog of their own and in june the group-blog kamikaze-demokratie was born . " it was a spontaneous idea to make a political blog that does n't take politics too seriously , " he said . weblogs also do n't seem to be taken too seriously in the german political sphere .

he did not specify how much of germany 's oil reserves of some 23 million tons of fuel he would offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the french government announced on friday that the 26 members of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- unanimously support measures calling for member states to release 60 million barrels of oil per day from their strategic reserves for one month in order to counter fuel disruptions caused by the hurricane . in addition to calling on oil companies to lower prices , schröder also offered help in the form of drinking water , medicine and emergency personnel . " we can help to accommodate those left destitute .
we can help purify water , send medicines like antibiotics and vaccines .

using the reserves would be a " clever and sensible possibility " to relieve pressure on consumers , westerwelle said . while germany 's best-selling daily , bild , echoed their call , demanding chancellor schröder to " cough up the cheap gas " in friday 's headline , the government initially opposed such a move . the reserves may only be put on the market if there are supply problems , government spokesman bela anda had told the press on friday morning . selective memory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- with bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and fdp leader westerwelle anda also took a jab at merkel , whose cdu , along with its bavarian sister csu , currently leads the election race with 43 percent against schröder 's social democrats at 32 percent , according to pollsters infratest dimap .

using the reserves would be a " clever and sensible possibility " to relieve pressure on consumers , westerwelle said . while germany 's best-selling daily , bild , echoed their call , demanding chancellor schröder to " cough up the cheap gas " in friday 's headline , the government initially opposed such a move . the reserves may only be put on the market if there are supply problems , government spokesman bela anda had told the press on friday morning . selective memory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- with bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and fdp leader westerwelle anda also took a jab at merkel , whose cdu , along with its bavarian sister csu , currently leads the election race with 43 percent against schröder 's social democrats at 32 percent , according to pollsters infratest dimap .
anda said that the cdu-led government , in which merkel was a cabinet member , in 1997 , sold off german reserves that went beyond the level the country was legally obliged to hold . " that shows that neither frau merkel nor herr westerwelle know what the legal requirements for a possible release of the oil reserves are , nor do they appear - in frau merkel 's case - to remember their own political past and responsibility , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepared to help the us while us emergency teams are working around the clock in the mostly submerged city of new orleans , the german government , although highly critical of us environmental policies , is offering its help .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .

but as the entries in his blog 's politics category continued grow , he realized they could sustain a blog of their own and in june the group-blog kamikaze-demokratie was born . " it was a spontaneous idea to make a political blog that does n't take politics too seriously , " he said . weblogs also do n't seem to be taken too seriously in the german political sphere .
unlike their cohorts in the united states , where blogs have become an influential part of the media , bloggers in germany do not expect to have much of an impact on the country 's election this september . blog scene still evolving " germany is still a developing country when it comes to blogs , " said markus beckedahl , who blogs at netzpolitik.org.
" the awareness of blogs as a means of political communication needs to be raised in germany . " though germany is home to an estimated 50,000 blogs , most of them deal with political topics as a result of the decision to call early elections .
they have names like election blog and election blog 05 . " up until now in germany , political weblogs have been solely a campaign phenomenon , " said christoph dowe , head of politik digital , an organization that keeps its eye on political uses of the internet .
" weblog culture in the usa has already penetrated much deeper in the media culture . " using blogs to get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howard dean was especially adept in using blogs to motivate supporters in 2004 while american political parties have already refined how to use weblogs to their advantage in motivating voters to get involved in campaigning , it 's a skill germany 's top-down parties have yet to pick up on , said michael essbach of the weblog küchenkabinett -lrb- kitchen cabinet -rrb- . " a reason for the smaller role of weblogs is definitely that campaigns in germany are not traditionally as anywhere near as involved with mobilizing voters to take part in campaigning as in the united states , " essbach said . though it 's not possible to compare german politicians ' blogs with other nations more in-tune with blogging as a whole , the country 's politicians are n't yet using the medium to get out new information , according to jan knöttig , who does n't hide his political leanings in his own stoppt-merkel.de site .
its subject is angela merkel , the conservative union 's candidate for chancellor .
he is not one of her fans . " it is great that so many politicians have discovered blogs for their campaigns , " he said .
" but too bad that most of them do not really concentrate on their entries , giving them all the charm of a press release . " politicians ' first try at blogging for politicians , who are the ones behind most of the country 's political blogs , this is their first foray into this brave new world .
they are using the internet journals as a way of informing and reaching out to voters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when not confronted with microphones , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger uses her blog to get her positions across " the weblog makes it possible for me to have direct contact with citizens , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the free democratic party , germany 's free-market liberals .
" this form of online diary is important in getting across my positions while campaigning . " christian democrat dorothee mantel said she mainly uses her blog to connect with constituents in addition to publicizing her stances on the issues . " weblogs are an excellent way to come into direct contact with people , " she said . more politicians would be well advised to follow her example or no one will miss them when they disapper after the election . " maybe one day the realization will come through that the internet can lead to a new form of communication between politicians and voters , " politik digital 's dowe said .
" that is a long way off in germany , but in the long-term there is no getting around opening up two-channel media formats .

strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .
if used properly , they can fill the gap .
each of these are eco-friendly . - syed ajaz , kashmir , india compiled by dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hurricane katrina causes jitters in europe hurricane katrina , currently pummelling the us , is sending shock waves over to europe too .

29 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons even as the damage caused by hurricane katrina in the us is assessed , the reason for its brutality is already known - global warming .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .

he did not specify how much of germany 's oil reserves of some 23 million tons of fuel he would offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the french government announced on friday that the 26 members of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- unanimously support measures calling for member states to release 60 million barrels of oil per day from their strategic reserves for one month in order to counter fuel disruptions caused by the hurricane . in addition to calling on oil companies to lower prices , schröder also offered help in the form of drinking water , medicine and emergency personnel .

but as the entries in his blog 's politics category continued grow , he realized they could sustain a blog of their own and in june the group-blog kamikaze-demokratie was born . " it was a spontaneous idea to make a political blog that does n't take politics too seriously , " he said . weblogs also do n't seem to be taken too seriously in the german political sphere .
unlike their cohorts in the united states , where blogs have become an influential part of the media , bloggers in germany do not expect to have much of an impact on the country 's election this september . blog scene still evolving " germany is still a developing country when it comes to blogs , " said markus beckedahl , who blogs at netzpolitik.org.
" the awareness of blogs as a means of political communication needs to be raised in germany . " though germany is home to an estimated 50,000 blogs , most of them deal with political topics as a result of the decision to call early elections .
they have names like election blog and election blog 05 . " up until now in germany , political weblogs have been solely a campaign phenomenon , " said christoph dowe , head of politik digital , an organization that keeps its eye on political uses of the internet .
" weblog culture in the usa has already penetrated much deeper in the media culture . " using blogs to get out the vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : howard dean was especially adept in using blogs to motivate supporters in 2004 while american political parties have already refined how to use weblogs to their advantage in motivating voters to get involved in campaigning , it 's a skill germany 's top-down parties have yet to pick up on , said michael essbach of the weblog küchenkabinett -lrb- kitchen cabinet -rrb- . " a reason for the smaller role of weblogs is definitely that campaigns in germany are not traditionally as anywhere near as involved with mobilizing voters to take part in campaigning as in the united states , " essbach said . though it 's not possible to compare german politicians ' blogs with other nations more in-tune with blogging as a whole , the country 's politicians are n't yet using the medium to get out new information , according to jan knöttig , who does n't hide his political leanings in his own stoppt-merkel.de site .
its subject is angela merkel , the conservative union 's candidate for chancellor .
he is not one of her fans . " it is great that so many politicians have discovered blogs for their campaigns , " he said .
" but too bad that most of them do not really concentrate on their entries , giving them all the charm of a press release . " politicians ' first try at blogging for politicians , who are the ones behind most of the country 's political blogs , this is their first foray into this brave new world .
they are using the internet journals as a way of informing and reaching out to voters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when not confronted with microphones , sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger uses her blog to get her positions across " the weblog makes it possible for me to have direct contact with citizens , " said sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger -lrb- photo -rrb- , a member of the free democratic party , germany 's free-market liberals .
" this form of online diary is important in getting across my positions while campaigning . " christian democrat dorothee mantel said she mainly uses her blog to connect with constituents in addition to publicizing her stances on the issues . " weblogs are an excellent way to come into direct contact with people , " she said . more politicians would be well advised to follow her example or no one will miss them when they disapper after the election . " maybe one day the realization will come through that the internet can lead to a new form of communication between politicians and voters , " politik digital 's dowe said .
" that is a long way off in germany , but in the long-term there is no getting around opening up two-channel media formats .

he did not specify how much of germany 's oil reserves of some 23 million tons of fuel he would offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the french government announced on friday that the 26 members of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- unanimously support measures calling for member states to release 60 million barrels of oil per day from their strategic reserves for one month in order to counter fuel disruptions caused by the hurricane . in addition to calling on oil companies to lower prices , schröder also offered help in the form of drinking water , medicine and emergency personnel . " we can help to accommodate those left destitute .
we can help purify water , send medicines like antibiotics and vaccines .
we have experts who can help restore water and electricity supply , " he said in a press conference .

he did not specify how much of germany 's oil reserves of some 23 million tons of fuel he would offer . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder the french government announced on friday that the 26 members of the international energy agency -lrb- iea -rrb- unanimously support measures calling for member states to release 60 million barrels of oil per day from their strategic reserves for one month in order to counter fuel disruptions caused by the hurricane . in addition to calling on oil companies to lower prices , schröder also offered help in the form of drinking water , medicine and emergency personnel . " we can help to accommodate those left destitute .
we can help purify water , send medicines like antibiotics and vaccines .
we have experts who can help restore water and electricity supply , " he said in a press conference .
" these are all things that we can supply at short notice . " many nations including france , belgium , australia , japan and venezuela have also offered aid to the united states . opposition calls for releasing reserves germany has possessed large oil reserves since the 1970s , when it - along with the other members of the oecd -lrb- organization for economic cooperation and development -rrb- - agreed to legally oblige itself to maintain stockpiles of 90 days of oil for emergencies . as the hurricane caused german gasoline prices to 1.47 euros per liter -lrb- $ 1.84 per 1/4 gallon -rrb- on friday , the party leaders of the conservative christian democrats and the free-market liberal free democrats , angela merkel and guido westerwelle , called for the government to release the country 's oil reserves to lower the cost . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " it should n't be a taboo in germany either , " merkel said in reference to george bush 's decision to release his own countries reserves .
using the reserves would be a " clever and sensible possibility " to relieve pressure on consumers , westerwelle said . while germany 's best-selling daily , bild , echoed their call , demanding chancellor schröder to " cough up the cheap gas " in friday 's headline , the government initially opposed such a move . the reserves may only be put on the market if there are supply problems , government spokesman bela anda had told the press on friday morning . selective memory ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel -lrb- center -rrb- with bavarian premier edmund stoiber -lrb- left -rrb- and fdp leader westerwelle anda also took a jab at merkel , whose cdu , along with its bavarian sister csu , currently leads the election race with 43 percent against schröder 's social democrats at 32 percent , according to pollsters infratest dimap .
anda said that the cdu-led government , in which merkel was a cabinet member , in 1997 , sold off german reserves that went beyond the level the country was legally obliged to hold . " that shows that neither frau merkel nor herr westerwelle know what the legal requirements for a possible release of the oil reserves are , nor do they appear - in frau merkel 's case - to remember their own political past and responsibility , " he said . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany prepared to help the us while us emergency teams are working around the clock in the mostly submerged city of new orleans , the german government , although highly critical of us environmental policies , is offering its help .

in germany , the issue is taking on more importance in the runup to general elections . turkish foreign minister abdullah gül made it very clear that foot-dragging by the european union in talks with his country will not be tolerated .
so much so that if additional conditions to turkey 's accession to the eu are set , ankara will abandon the whole process .
" should they propose anything short of full membership or any new conditions , we will walk away , " he said .
" and this time it will be for good . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turks supporting the sovereignty of turkish cyprus -lrb- flag left -rrb- the announcement came one day after tension renewed between the two parties over turkey 's continued resistance to recognize the eu member cyprus , which has been divided into two halves since 1974 .

french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy , following leads from french leaders who are reacting to public opposition to turkish eu membership , felt that it was inconceivable that ankara should negotiate accession while refusing to recognize an eu member state .
danish foreign minister per stig moeller , however , said that since this was never a condition for membership talks , the eu could not suddenly change the rules .

the potential coalition partners of the cdu / csu , the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , also reject turkish membership in the eu .
sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said that if ankara can not treat cyprus on an equal footing with the other 24 eu states , then it risks the start of talks in october .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .

dw-world readers comment on the disaster . the following comments reflect the views of our readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . to blame the katrina disaster on global warming is just too simplistic of an explanation .
strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .
if used properly , they can fill the gap .
each of these are eco-friendly . - syed ajaz , kashmir , india compiled by dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hurricane katrina causes jitters in europe hurricane katrina , currently pummelling the us , is sending shock waves over to europe too .
on monday , the storm caused oil prices to surge to record highs .
stock exchanges stumbled and insurers buckled as anxiety grew .

29 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons even as the damage caused by hurricane katrina in the us is assessed , the reason for its brutality is already known - global warming .

strong hurricanes have been occurring for centuries , but now we have more development and infrastructure along the southeast us coastal areas than ever before .
i think for every climate expert who wants to blame intense hurricanes on global warming , one will find another climate expert that will say that this claim ca n't be proven as the cause . - boyd lawrence , us we in america are reading how german media is lying about the " cause " of katrina .
we are disgusted !
how do you think americans feel about the morality of the german media -lrb- including dw -rrb- and national political parties that gloat and pat themselves on the back over the misfortune of others ?
what kind of nation are you ?
i , for one , will never support any attempt to prevent global warming just because you have made the selfish attempt to gain political points off of what is a genuine tragedy .
germany is to be pitied , because once again it has lost its moral focus .
germany is no ally of the usa ! - steven l. chapman , us in response to your question as to whether attacks on us environmental policy are justified , the answer is yes .
the new orleans levees were built to stand up to only a category iii hurricane because building them to withstand a categories iv and v supposedly would have cost too much .
now new orleans is destroyed and america is sinking under a president who is offering little more than a simpleton 's grin and a " good luck - it 'll all turn out fine " to the million refugees in louisiana , mississippi and alabama .
president bush is incapable of understanding the magnitude of the catastrophe and the depth of the suffering .
there was no plan in place to respond to such a disaster - and such planning is one of the primary responsibilities of any government .
i have been saying for years that the united states is turning into a third world country where the upper 5 percent of the population controls the government and therefore the lion 's share of the wealth .
i can well understand germany 's wanting to stand back and say " we told you so , " but , please , send these people long-term help .
unless you and other wealthy countries send help , these people will never recover . - janet zimmer , us you have hijacked one of the worst human crises in american history as just another vehicle for anti-bush ranting and america bashing .
regardless of its dubious accuracy , the notion that us environmental policy is somehow to blame for the catastrophe in new orleans is irrelevant at this stage and offensive to the core . - russel , us shame on you germans .
i am american born of german parents and your lack of concern and compassion in these trying times and lack of support and financial aid without being asked is despicable .
i am appalled at your lack of response .
not proud of my ancestry ! - susan kempf , us we are very touched by the messages of sympathy and offers of help that are being sent from so many countries around the world in the wake of this terrible disaster .
it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .
if used properly , they can fill the gap .
each of these are eco-friendly . - syed ajaz , kashmir , india compiled by dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hurricane katrina causes jitters in europe hurricane katrina , currently pummelling the us , is sending shock waves over to europe too .

it is refreshing to see that a helping hand is extended to the us in our hour of need .
our family is grateful for the positive reaction from so many countries . - heidi stopper , us we are aware that we do not have the best environmental policy in the world , however we also do n't have record unemployment .
how many of you on the other side of the pond can say the same ?
we are in the process of achieving a balance between a protected environment and also a competitive and efficient economy and it is not something that happens overnight .
in regards to criticisms about our country , we will remember this hostility .
when the world comes calling for our money , we 'll rightfully turn the cold shoulder .
americans , however , would never do that , as we are not as bitter as some other people in the world . - joseph , us although they may seem callous just now , i have no problem with -lrb- verbal -rrb- attacks on us environmental policy .
the policies are terrible .
one can not rightly blame the hurricane on us environmental policy , but that does n't make the policies any better .
the foolishness of this president , and not only of his environmental policies , can not be pointed out often enough .
it must be made clear to everyone , in all circumstances . - tim , us the german non-stop vitriolic criticism of us policies is n't about the iraq war or environmental issues .
it 's a pitiful attempt to reclaim the moral credibility germany forfeited 60 years ago .
by the way , it 's not working . - carla cook , us where are all the offers of help to the us , to aid the victims , to offer supplies , etc ?
i have not heard of any .
the us is always ready to help others , but where is the help when we need it ?
yes , we are a rich country , and the aid is probably not needed .
still , perhaps the world hates us that much .
if so , -lrb- when -rrb- the next major catastrophe happens elsewhere in the world , the us should just ignore it and perhaps just watch it on tv . - werner bauder , charleston , south carolina , usa basically , the emergency response is really sorry , to say the least .
on cnn they just pat each other on the back about the great job everybody is doing but actually , they 're plucking up survivors two or three at a time with those little cg helicopters , while the military 's big helicopters are being shot down in iraq .
and whine , whine , whine about the damage , as if it were n't the us 's own fault that our coastal areas become more vulnerable by the year .
heck , with the money we 're spending on bush 's wars , we could have moved all of new orleans further inland , considering that it has started to sink below sea level several decades ago already .
besides , the folks on the gulf coast are still better off than what our military is doling out to the iraqi people with such glee , although these callous women on cnn keep comparing this disaster with hiroshima .
the biggest whining they do is about the looters in new orleans , like that 's even important since the insurance companies have to replace everything anyway .
those police officers running off looters would spend their time better trying to evacuate the by now 30,000 people in the local football stadium that 's surrounded by several feet of water already with the water level getting higher and higher .
that shows you their priorities , does n't it ?
the whole thing is nothing but a disorganized mess while our troops are busy dropping another 500 bombs on iraq . - bryan m. , usa global warming is a problem .
i am totally ashamed of other countries that have not offered any help to katrina hurricane victims in the us .
thank god we do not need you .
shame on all of you . - luis , usa a recent opinion piece by jens thurau " katrina holds familiar lessons " is wrought with misinformation and political bias . jens should refer to historical facts as the deadlier hurricanes occurred during the early part of the 20th century . - don bartley there are many alternatives to bio-fossils , particularly solar energy , wind energy , water resources etc . , which all are renewable .
if used properly , they can fill the gap .
each of these are eco-friendly . - syed ajaz , kashmir , india compiled by dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hurricane katrina causes jitters in europe hurricane katrina , currently pummelling the us , is sending shock waves over to europe too .
on monday , the storm caused oil prices to surge to record highs .
stock exchanges stumbled and insurers buckled as anxiety grew .
-lrb- aug .
29 , 2005 -rrb- opinion : katrina holds familiar lessons even as the damage caused by hurricane katrina in the us is assessed , the reason for its brutality is already known - global warming .
it underlines yet again there is no alternative to global climate protection .

" when reason finally reaches the headquarters of the climate polluters , the international community will need to be able to extend a hand with an elaborate proposal for the future of international climate protection .
the german government stands ready for this , " he added . a n gry america n s americans , who are already reeling from the horror of what is happening in louisiana , have reacted in fury to what they see as cold callous remarks , which leave no doubt that anti-american sentiment is rife in a nation which claims to be its " friend " .

" bad timi n g karsten voigt , who co-ordinates us-german relations at the foreign ministry , told the washi n gto n post that trittin 's remarks were ill-timed , but defended the substance . " at this very moment our solidarity and condolences should be at the forefront , " he said .

in the aftermath , there will be a new debate about origins , causes and solutions . " bildunterschrift : a home sits destroyed a spokesman for trittin said he had not intended to be insensitive to those caught up in katrina , adding that the extent of the hurricane was not known at the time the piece went to press .

president george w bush has described it as " one of the worst natural disasters " the us has seen .
bbc correspondents report from across louisiana and mississippi as authorities struggle to restore order .
jamie coomarasamy : baton rouge , la : 06:45 gmt with every day the level of desperation here is rising .
thousands of people are still trapped inside new orleans in a city where the authorities appear overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster .
like many of the people living in unsanitary and dangerous conditions in the city , local officials are now pointing fingers , in their case at the federal government .
the head of new orleans emergency operations described the relief effort as a national disgrace .
he asked why america can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims but ca n't bail out his city .
meanwhile , thousands of national guardsmen are due to arrive in louisiana from across the united states to try to stem a tide of lawlessness which threatens to leave scars on the community long after the floodwaters have receded .
daniel lak : new orleans , la : 04:45 gmt the authorities in the state of mississippi say they wo n't have extra personnel to make special security arrangements for the visit of president bush to the storm-ravaged gulf coast on friday .
secret service and other federal agencies are expected to compensate for that .
all police and law enforcement officials in this area are needed for flood relief operations in the wake of hurricane katrina .
president bush will see the massive floating casinos that have been hurled up on shore , thousands of smashed homes and downed power-lines , and perhaps gatherings of homeless people , for there are many of them here .
the president 's handling of the crisis so far has been criticised by some local people in this area , who 've told reporters they thought he should have done more - and sooner .
politics aside , the president 's visit should help speed up the rescue operation , which many here feel has been too slow to get started .
peter marshall : new orleans , la : 21:44 gmt i 've spent the day touring new orleans now under 20ft of water in some places .
around the city 's convention centre the scene is ugly , there has been violence and shots have been fired .
there is no food , there are no toilets .
the need to seek protection is instinctive , people here are afraid , they gather in huddles near the police .
canal street is now itself a canal .
new orleans is utterly and perhaps forever changed .
david willis : biloxi , ms : 21:10 gmt the aftermath is posing a major challenge for rescue teams charged with checking every building in this costal town .
the force of the hurricane was unbelievable .
sniffer dogs have been brought in to help with the search , as well as manpower from every state in the union .
hotel guests use bed sheets on their balconies to beg for help .
bulldozers have started clearing the streets after rats were seen gathering amongst the rubble .
officials here are estimating that nearly 1,000 have died in this community .
matt frei : new orleans , la : 21:03 gmt i drove into the city just a few hours ago and it was one of the scarier journeys i have made .
it looks like the set of a hollywood disaster movie .
the battle between nature and man is almost over , but the battle between man and man is just beginning .
the scene here is more africa than america .
from the air the destruction is humbling , luxury yachts thrown about like toys .
looking closer there is stagnant , dirty water , and then there are the survivors , mostly poor , black and angry .
you see dead bodies here as you wander around the streets .
adam brookes : new orleans , la : 20:35 gmt on the approaches to new orleans a trail of people - those who 've decided to walk out of the city - line the highways .
in the centre of the city thousands have gathered outside the stadium waiting for a seat in the long convoy of buses and evacuation .
most waited without any food or water .
a group of elderly residents of a care home in wheelchairs sat bewildered in the ninety degree heat and rain .
the evacuation appears agonisingly slow and it 's unclear why , after three days , so many people seem to be without relief supplies .
one man , fury and exhaustion etched on his face , shouted at me : " this is america , why are we in this situation ? "
daniel lak , gulf port , ms : 18:50 gmt this already poor part of america has been utterly devastated by hurricane katrina and the authorities are struggling to cope .
the top concern is public health , with most drinking water contaminated .
a mandatory order to boil all tap water has been issued .
looters are being warned to stay away from damaged shops by the police and many shop owners are guarding their premises with guns .
it will take years to get this area even remotely back to normal .
jonathan beale , washington d.c. : 16:42 gmt we have been hearing about the relief efforts at a white house press briefing .
we know president bush has asked for extra finances from congress for aid , he wants to make sure there is enough funds for the clean up , which is going to take a long time .
president bush is under pressure for his handling of this , but so far most of the criticism has been in the media .
the new york times said that bush 's speech yesterday was one of the worst speeches of his life .
there is criticism from the people struggling on the ground too , but so far there has been no vocal criticism from other politicians .
the hurricane having gone , the political storm will now brew .
jamie coomarasamy , louisiana : 16:21 gmt evacuees from new orleans continue to pour into louisiana 's state capital , swelling this city 's numbers and stretching its resources .
i am at the department for homeland security in louisiana and they are clearly struggling here .
they are very aware of the problems with lawlessness .
one official told me that it was a difficult task for the law enforcement people but that they would be successful in getting everyone out .
some of the shelters here have over 8,000 people .
they are turning up with nothing more than the clothes they are wearing , wandering about aimlessly , looking for loved ones .
alastair leithead , new orleans , ms : 16:08 gmt it is pretty lawless here now on the streets of new orleans .
it has been deteriorating over the last 24 hours including a shooting at the dome where people are staying .
i can hear a rescue helicopter overhead now , people are desperate , they have no way of leaving .
there is no evidence of co-ordination , no details , no buses - people have no idea how they can get out of here .
there is real anger here too that things are not being done quickly here .
there are groups of one and two thousand people together in different places but there is no aid being given to them .
there have been shoot outs between police and armed looters .
it is difficult to define looting , is it people just trying to get food and clothes or real looters trying to steal what they can get .
daniel lak , gulf port , ms : 16:00 gmt there 's not much left of the shops , businesses , hotels and casinos that used to line the beach front here and in neighbouring boloxi but there have been reports of people looking through the rubble for cash or luxury goods .
rental car agencies have posted guards and the police patrol frequently , especially in the pitch black of night .
emergency management officials are trying to co-ordinate a rescue effort on the huge scale necessary to meet the needs of more than 100,000 needy people , perhaps more , many of whom have lost their homes and all their possessions .
the death rate could also climb a searches continue for survivors in areas still cut off three days on .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 15:05 gmt a few moments ago a man came up to me and asked if i was a journalist .
he said : " can you help me ?
i need to save the lives of 60 women . "
twelve blocks away there are 60 people in an old people 's home and 30 staff who have been looking after them since the hurricane struck .
he said they had enough water to last 12 hours , two of the women had died already and three more will probably die today .
" who can i ask ? " he said .
i said i did n't know and he wandered off .
the policemen would n't talk to him so he 's gone off to try to find someone who might help .
that 's just one isolated case and there are many more like that across this city .
it is a desperate situation .
there is a real feeling here that not enough is being done and certainly not fast enough .
jamie coomarasamy , baton rouge , la : 15:00 gmt president bush has said there will be zero tolerance for people who break the law on the gulf coast .
he is arriving to see the devastation for himself on friday and is expected to call on his two predecessors in the white house - president clinton and president bush senior , to help raise funds .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 13:30 gmt we 've just heard that the evacuation operation that has been taking place at the dome , the football stadium where up to 20,000 people have been staying , has been suspended because shots were fired within the dome .
apparently shots were also fired at a rescue helicopter that was passing overhead .
there really is an edgy feeling about the city , it is no longer comfortable and it does n't seem as if the emergency services are dealing with this very well .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 12:10 gmt this whole city is going to be evacuated - everybody is going to leave and they do n't know when they are going to be allowed to come back .
there 's a real sense of desperation amongst those people who 've waded and swum their way from their flooded houses to the only part of dry land in downtown to find that there 's no water , no food and no plan to get them out .
people are being evacuated but it 's a very slow process and the authorities , it appears , are struggling to cope .
jonathan beale , washington , dc : 12:05 gmt there 's concern , first of all , about the national guard .
we 've seen those images - and so have the american public - of the widespread looting in the region .

president george w bush has described it as " one of the worst natural disasters " the us has seen .
bbc correspondents report from across louisiana and mississippi as authorities struggle to restore order .
jamie coomarasamy : baton rouge , la : 06:45 gmt with every day the level of desperation here is rising .
thousands of people are still trapped inside new orleans in a city where the authorities appear overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster .
like many of the people living in unsanitary and dangerous conditions in the city , local officials are now pointing fingers , in their case at the federal government .
the head of new orleans emergency operations described the relief effort as a national disgrace .
he asked why america can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims but ca n't bail out his city .
meanwhile , thousands of national guardsmen are due to arrive in louisiana from across the united states to try to stem a tide of lawlessness which threatens to leave scars on the community long after the floodwaters have receded .
daniel lak : new orleans , la : 04:45 gmt the authorities in the state of mississippi say they wo n't have extra personnel to make special security arrangements for the visit of president bush to the storm-ravaged gulf coast on friday .
secret service and other federal agencies are expected to compensate for that .
all police and law enforcement officials in this area are needed for flood relief operations in the wake of hurricane katrina .
president bush will see the massive floating casinos that have been hurled up on shore , thousands of smashed homes and downed power-lines , and perhaps gatherings of homeless people , for there are many of them here .
the president 's handling of the crisis so far has been criticised by some local people in this area , who 've told reporters they thought he should have done more - and sooner .
politics aside , the president 's visit should help speed up the rescue operation , which many here feel has been too slow to get started .
peter marshall : new orleans , la : 21:44 gmt i 've spent the day touring new orleans now under 20ft of water in some places .
around the city 's convention centre the scene is ugly , there has been violence and shots have been fired .
there is no food , there are no toilets .
the need to seek protection is instinctive , people here are afraid , they gather in huddles near the police .
canal street is now itself a canal .
new orleans is utterly and perhaps forever changed .
david willis : biloxi , ms : 21:10 gmt the aftermath is posing a major challenge for rescue teams charged with checking every building in this costal town .
the force of the hurricane was unbelievable .
sniffer dogs have been brought in to help with the search , as well as manpower from every state in the union .
hotel guests use bed sheets on their balconies to beg for help .
bulldozers have started clearing the streets after rats were seen gathering amongst the rubble .
officials here are estimating that nearly 1,000 have died in this community .
matt frei : new orleans , la : 21:03 gmt i drove into the city just a few hours ago and it was one of the scarier journeys i have made .
it looks like the set of a hollywood disaster movie .
the battle between nature and man is almost over , but the battle between man and man is just beginning .
the scene here is more africa than america .
from the air the destruction is humbling , luxury yachts thrown about like toys .
looking closer there is stagnant , dirty water , and then there are the survivors , mostly poor , black and angry .
you see dead bodies here as you wander around the streets .
adam brookes : new orleans , la : 20:35 gmt on the approaches to new orleans a trail of people - those who 've decided to walk out of the city - line the highways .
in the centre of the city thousands have gathered outside the stadium waiting for a seat in the long convoy of buses and evacuation .
most waited without any food or water .
a group of elderly residents of a care home in wheelchairs sat bewildered in the ninety degree heat and rain .
the evacuation appears agonisingly slow and it 's unclear why , after three days , so many people seem to be without relief supplies .
one man , fury and exhaustion etched on his face , shouted at me : " this is america , why are we in this situation ? "
daniel lak , gulf port , ms : 18:50 gmt this already poor part of america has been utterly devastated by hurricane katrina and the authorities are struggling to cope .
the top concern is public health , with most drinking water contaminated .
a mandatory order to boil all tap water has been issued .
looters are being warned to stay away from damaged shops by the police and many shop owners are guarding their premises with guns .
it will take years to get this area even remotely back to normal .
jonathan beale , washington d.c. : 16:42 gmt we have been hearing about the relief efforts at a white house press briefing .
we know president bush has asked for extra finances from congress for aid , he wants to make sure there is enough funds for the clean up , which is going to take a long time .
president bush is under pressure for his handling of this , but so far most of the criticism has been in the media .
the new york times said that bush 's speech yesterday was one of the worst speeches of his life .
there is criticism from the people struggling on the ground too , but so far there has been no vocal criticism from other politicians .
the hurricane having gone , the political storm will now brew .
jamie coomarasamy , louisiana : 16:21 gmt evacuees from new orleans continue to pour into louisiana 's state capital , swelling this city 's numbers and stretching its resources .
i am at the department for homeland security in louisiana and they are clearly struggling here .
they are very aware of the problems with lawlessness .
one official told me that it was a difficult task for the law enforcement people but that they would be successful in getting everyone out .
some of the shelters here have over 8,000 people .
they are turning up with nothing more than the clothes they are wearing , wandering about aimlessly , looking for loved ones .
alastair leithead , new orleans , ms : 16:08 gmt it is pretty lawless here now on the streets of new orleans .
it has been deteriorating over the last 24 hours including a shooting at the dome where people are staying .
i can hear a rescue helicopter overhead now , people are desperate , they have no way of leaving .
there is no evidence of co-ordination , no details , no buses - people have no idea how they can get out of here .
there is real anger here too that things are not being done quickly here .
there are groups of one and two thousand people together in different places but there is no aid being given to them .
there have been shoot outs between police and armed looters .
it is difficult to define looting , is it people just trying to get food and clothes or real looters trying to steal what they can get .
daniel lak , gulf port , ms : 16:00 gmt there 's not much left of the shops , businesses , hotels and casinos that used to line the beach front here and in neighbouring boloxi but there have been reports of people looking through the rubble for cash or luxury goods .
rental car agencies have posted guards and the police patrol frequently , especially in the pitch black of night .
emergency management officials are trying to co-ordinate a rescue effort on the huge scale necessary to meet the needs of more than 100,000 needy people , perhaps more , many of whom have lost their homes and all their possessions .
the death rate could also climb a searches continue for survivors in areas still cut off three days on .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 15:05 gmt a few moments ago a man came up to me and asked if i was a journalist .
he said : " can you help me ?
i need to save the lives of 60 women . "
twelve blocks away there are 60 people in an old people 's home and 30 staff who have been looking after them since the hurricane struck .
he said they had enough water to last 12 hours , two of the women had died already and three more will probably die today .
" who can i ask ? " he said .
i said i did n't know and he wandered off .
the policemen would n't talk to him so he 's gone off to try to find someone who might help .
that 's just one isolated case and there are many more like that across this city .
it is a desperate situation .
there is a real feeling here that not enough is being done and certainly not fast enough .
jamie coomarasamy , baton rouge , la : 15:00 gmt president bush has said there will be zero tolerance for people who break the law on the gulf coast .
he is arriving to see the devastation for himself on friday and is expected to call on his two predecessors in the white house - president clinton and president bush senior , to help raise funds .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 13:30 gmt we 've just heard that the evacuation operation that has been taking place at the dome , the football stadium where up to 20,000 people have been staying , has been suspended because shots were fired within the dome .
apparently shots were also fired at a rescue helicopter that was passing overhead .
there really is an edgy feeling about the city , it is no longer comfortable and it does n't seem as if the emergency services are dealing with this very well .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 12:10 gmt this whole city is going to be evacuated - everybody is going to leave and they do n't know when they are going to be allowed to come back .
there 's a real sense of desperation amongst those people who 've waded and swum their way from their flooded houses to the only part of dry land in downtown to find that there 's no water , no food and no plan to get them out .
people are being evacuated but it 's a very slow process and the authorities , it appears , are struggling to cope .
jonathan beale , washington , dc : 12:05 gmt there 's concern , first of all , about the national guard .
we 've seen those images - and so have the american public - of the widespread looting in the region .
questions are being asked - well , where are the forces of law and order ?
and then there are questions about the cost of the clean-up and the rescue .
america is spending $ 200bn on iraq and people want to know there 's plenty more money to help their own people .
president bush reassures people america can fight its war on terror and do this clean up but he 's appealing for patience too .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 11:45 gmt there 's a peculiar feeling of danger and foreboding here in new orleans , as those people left marooned in the city are becoming increasingly desperate .
armed gangs have moved into some hotels and looting has reached an alarming level .
there have been shootouts between gangs and criminals and there are reports that martial law has been imposed across parts of the city .
the mayor has pulled the majority of his police force away from the search and rescue effort to provide backup for those fighting crime .
adam brookes : new orleans , la : 11:30 gmt the most striking thing is the sheer level of resources and power of the american emergency machine when it gets going .
people knew this storm was coming - they were able to evacuate and prepare to some degree .
if you look around the edges of new orleans - we 've been down there taking a look - you can see the colossal resources being brought in pretty quickly .
columns of hundreds and hundreds of speedboats drawn by pickups arrived practically instantaneously .
the american military has got helicopters lifting off and touching down by the moment .
america can deal with these things effectively but equally the american public has much higher expectations of its government .
we 've just been hearing president bush being questioned for the first time by journalists about why the relief effort is perceived to be quite slow and i think the bush administration may be in some trouble here .

in the centre of the city thousands have gathered outside the stadium waiting for a seat in the long convoy of buses and evacuation .
most waited without any food or water .
a group of elderly residents of a care home in wheelchairs sat bewildered in the ninety degree heat and rain .
the evacuation appears agonisingly slow and it 's unclear why , after three days , so many people seem to be without relief supplies .
one man , fury and exhaustion etched on his face , shouted at me : " this is america , why are we in this situation ? "
daniel lak , gulf port , ms : 18:50 gmt this already poor part of america has been utterly devastated by hurricane katrina and the authorities are struggling to cope .
the top concern is public health , with most drinking water contaminated .
a mandatory order to boil all tap water has been issued .
looters are being warned to stay away from damaged shops by the police and many shop owners are guarding their premises with guns .
it will take years to get this area even remotely back to normal .
jonathan beale , washington d.c. : 16:42 gmt we have been hearing about the relief efforts at a white house press briefing .
we know president bush has asked for extra finances from congress for aid , he wants to make sure there is enough funds for the clean up , which is going to take a long time .
president bush is under pressure for his handling of this , but so far most of the criticism has been in the media .
the new york times said that bush 's speech yesterday was one of the worst speeches of his life .
there is criticism from the people struggling on the ground too , but so far there has been no vocal criticism from other politicians .
the hurricane having gone , the political storm will now brew .
jamie coomarasamy , louisiana : 16:21 gmt evacuees from new orleans continue to pour into louisiana 's state capital , swelling this city 's numbers and stretching its resources .
i am at the department for homeland security in louisiana and they are clearly struggling here .
they are very aware of the problems with lawlessness .
one official told me that it was a difficult task for the law enforcement people but that they would be successful in getting everyone out .
some of the shelters here have over 8,000 people .
they are turning up with nothing more than the clothes they are wearing , wandering about aimlessly , looking for loved ones .
alastair leithead , new orleans , ms : 16:08 gmt it is pretty lawless here now on the streets of new orleans .
it has been deteriorating over the last 24 hours including a shooting at the dome where people are staying .
i can hear a rescue helicopter overhead now , people are desperate , they have no way of leaving .
there is no evidence of co-ordination , no details , no buses - people have no idea how they can get out of here .
there is real anger here too that things are not being done quickly here .
there are groups of one and two thousand people together in different places but there is no aid being given to them .
there have been shoot outs between police and armed looters .
it is difficult to define looting , is it people just trying to get food and clothes or real looters trying to steal what they can get .
daniel lak , gulf port , ms : 16:00 gmt there 's not much left of the shops , businesses , hotels and casinos that used to line the beach front here and in neighbouring boloxi but there have been reports of people looking through the rubble for cash or luxury goods .
rental car agencies have posted guards and the police patrol frequently , especially in the pitch black of night .
emergency management officials are trying to co-ordinate a rescue effort on the huge scale necessary to meet the needs of more than 100,000 needy people , perhaps more , many of whom have lost their homes and all their possessions .
the death rate could also climb a searches continue for survivors in areas still cut off three days on .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 15:05 gmt a few moments ago a man came up to me and asked if i was a journalist .
he said : " can you help me ?
i need to save the lives of 60 women . "
twelve blocks away there are 60 people in an old people 's home and 30 staff who have been looking after them since the hurricane struck .
he said they had enough water to last 12 hours , two of the women had died already and three more will probably die today .
" who can i ask ? " he said .
i said i did n't know and he wandered off .
the policemen would n't talk to him so he 's gone off to try to find someone who might help .
that 's just one isolated case and there are many more like that across this city .
it is a desperate situation .
there is a real feeling here that not enough is being done and certainly not fast enough .
jamie coomarasamy , baton rouge , la : 15:00 gmt president bush has said there will be zero tolerance for people who break the law on the gulf coast .
he is arriving to see the devastation for himself on friday and is expected to call on his two predecessors in the white house - president clinton and president bush senior , to help raise funds .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 13:30 gmt we 've just heard that the evacuation operation that has been taking place at the dome , the football stadium where up to 20,000 people have been staying , has been suspended because shots were fired within the dome .
apparently shots were also fired at a rescue helicopter that was passing overhead .
there really is an edgy feeling about the city , it is no longer comfortable and it does n't seem as if the emergency services are dealing with this very well .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 12:10 gmt this whole city is going to be evacuated - everybody is going to leave and they do n't know when they are going to be allowed to come back .
there 's a real sense of desperation amongst those people who 've waded and swum their way from their flooded houses to the only part of dry land in downtown to find that there 's no water , no food and no plan to get them out .
people are being evacuated but it 's a very slow process and the authorities , it appears , are struggling to cope .
jonathan beale , washington , dc : 12:05 gmt there 's concern , first of all , about the national guard .
we 've seen those images - and so have the american public - of the widespread looting in the region .
questions are being asked - well , where are the forces of law and order ?
and then there are questions about the cost of the clean-up and the rescue .
america is spending $ 200bn on iraq and people want to know there 's plenty more money to help their own people .
president bush reassures people america can fight its war on terror and do this clean up but he 's appealing for patience too .
alastair leithead , new orleans , la : 11:45 gmt there 's a peculiar feeling of danger and foreboding here in new orleans , as those people left marooned in the city are becoming increasingly desperate .
armed gangs have moved into some hotels and looting has reached an alarming level .
there have been shootouts between gangs and criminals and there are reports that martial law has been imposed across parts of the city .
the mayor has pulled the majority of his police force away from the search and rescue effort to provide backup for those fighting crime .
adam brookes : new orleans , la : 11:30 gmt the most striking thing is the sheer level of resources and power of the american emergency machine when it gets going .
people knew this storm was coming - they were able to evacuate and prepare to some degree .
if you look around the edges of new orleans - we 've been down there taking a look - you can see the colossal resources being brought in pretty quickly .
columns of hundreds and hundreds of speedboats drawn by pickups arrived practically instantaneously .
the american military has got helicopters lifting off and touching down by the moment .
america can deal with these things effectively but equally the american public has much higher expectations of its government .
we 've just been hearing president bush being questioned for the first time by journalists about why the relief effort is perceived to be quite slow and i think the bush administration may be in some trouble here .

president george w bush has described it as " one of the worst natural disasters " the us has seen .
bbc correspondents report from across louisiana and mississippi as authorities struggle to restore order .
jamie coomarasamy : baton rouge , la : 06:45 gmt with every day the level of desperation here is rising .
thousands of people are still trapped inside new orleans in a city where the authorities appear overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster .
like many of the people living in unsanitary and dangerous conditions in the city , local officials are now pointing fingers , in their case at the federal government .
the head of new orleans emergency operations described the relief effort as a national disgrace .
he asked why america can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims but ca n't bail out his city .
meanwhile , thousands of national guardsmen are due to arrive in louisiana from across the united states to try to stem a tide of lawlessness which threatens to leave scars on the community long after the floodwaters have receded .
daniel lak : new orleans , la : 04:45 gmt the authorities in the state of mississippi say they wo n't have extra personnel to make special security arrangements for the visit of president bush to the storm-ravaged gulf coast on friday .
secret service and other federal agencies are expected to compensate for that .
all police and law enforcement officials in this area are needed for flood relief operations in the wake of hurricane katrina .
president bush will see the massive floating casinos that have been hurled up on shore , thousands of smashed homes and downed power-lines , and perhaps gatherings of homeless people , for there are many of them here .
the president 's handling of the crisis so far has been criticised by some local people in this area , who 've told reporters they thought he should have done more - and sooner .
politics aside , the president 's visit should help speed up the rescue operation , which many here feel has been too slow to get started .
peter marshall : new orleans , la : 21:44 gmt i 've spent the day touring new orleans now under 20ft of water in some places .
around the city 's convention centre the scene is ugly , there has been violence and shots have been fired .
there is no food , there are no toilets .
the need to seek protection is instinctive , people here are afraid , they gather in huddles near the police .
canal street is now itself a canal .
new orleans is utterly and perhaps forever changed .
david willis : biloxi , ms : 21:10 gmt the aftermath is posing a major challenge for rescue teams charged with checking every building in this costal town .
the force of the hurricane was unbelievable .
sniffer dogs have been brought in to help with the search , as well as manpower from every state in the union .
hotel guests use bed sheets on their balconies to beg for help .
bulldozers have started clearing the streets after rats were seen gathering amongst the rubble .
officials here are estimating that nearly 1,000 have died in this community .
matt frei : new orleans , la : 21:03 gmt i drove into the city just a few hours ago and it was one of the scarier journeys i have made .
it looks like the set of a hollywood disaster movie .
the battle between nature and man is almost over , but the battle between man and man is just beginning .
the scene here is more africa than america .
from the air the destruction is humbling , luxury yachts thrown about like toys .
looking closer there is stagnant , dirty water , and then there are the survivors , mostly poor , black and angry .
you see dead bodies here as you wander around the streets .
adam brookes : new orleans , la : 20:35 gmt on the approaches to new orleans a trail of people - those who 've decided to walk out of the city - line the highways .
in the centre of the city thousands have gathered outside the stadium waiting for a seat in the long convoy of buses and evacuation .
most waited without any food or water .
a group of elderly residents of a care home in wheelchairs sat bewildered in the ninety degree heat and rain .

the disciplinary measures were approved by two committees on thursday evening after several weeks of hearings .
the accused have been linked to an scheme in which the governing workers party illegally paid mps allegedly in return for political support .
the former chief of staff to brazil 's president is among those accused .
little by little these hearings have uncovered corruption at the very heart of brazil 's political system .

it names 18 mps from six parties who will face a disciplinary process which could end in their expulsion .

the special rapporteur on adequate housing , miloon kothari , spent the past two weeks travelling around cambodia .
he said that rich and powerful interests were grabbing land , leaving thousands of people dispossessed .
over the past year land deals have been an increasing source of controversy , but this is the first time they have gained international attention .
the un official has been to several disputed sites .
they include a village in poipet near the thai border where five people died during forced evictions , and a river island in phnom penh , whose inhabitants are under pressure to sell up to a property developer .
there is a frenzy now across the country by the rich and powerful in cambodia to acquire land miloon kothari , un special rapporteur on adequate housing mr kothari is particularly concerned about the practice of land swaps .
in recent months , dozens of publicly owned facilities have been given to private companies for redevelopment without any bidding process .
the companies are supposed to build new public facilities and housing in return , but mr kothari said they were using poor land which did not have access to electricity or running water , and thousands of families had been displaced .
he is asking for more transparency in the government 's dealings .
" there is a frenzy now across the country by the rich and powerful in cambodia to acquire land .
i think the donor communities and the un agencies need to be much more outspoken .
what i find missing here is a sense of outrage that should be there , " he said .
cambodia 's prime minister , hun sen , announced a moratorium on land swaps at the beginning of june , but deals are still coming to light .
last week , the interior ministry announced that part of phnom penh 's royal palace had been given to a property developer .

the special rapporteur on adequate housing , miloon kothari , spent the past two weeks travelling around cambodia .
he said that rich and powerful interests were grabbing land , leaving thousands of people dispossessed .
over the past year land deals have been an increasing source of controversy , but this is the first time they have gained international attention .
the un official has been to several disputed sites .
they include a village in poipet near the thai border where five people died during forced evictions , and a river island in phnom penh , whose inhabitants are under pressure to sell up to a property developer .
there is a frenzy now across the country by the rich and powerful in cambodia to acquire land miloon kothari , un special rapporteur on adequate housing mr kothari is particularly concerned about the practice of land swaps .
in recent months , dozens of publicly owned facilities have been given to private companies for redevelopment without any bidding process .
the companies are supposed to build new public facilities and housing in return , but mr kothari said they were using poor land which did not have access to electricity or running water , and thousands of families had been displaced .
he is asking for more transparency in the government 's dealings .
" there is a frenzy now across the country by the rich and powerful in cambodia to acquire land .
i think the donor communities and the un agencies need to be much more outspoken .
what i find missing here is a sense of outrage that should be there , " he said .
cambodia 's prime minister , hun sen , announced a moratorium on land swaps at the beginning of june , but deals are still coming to light .
last week , the interior ministry announced that part of phnom penh 's royal palace had been given to a property developer .

the group said pre-tax profits after one-offs had fallen 16 % to £ 38.7m for the year to 24 july .
unfavourable media coverage of binge drinking had hit customer numbers in town and city centres , it said .
in a bid to address the problem , the firm added it had banned two-for-one drink offers and discounts on doubles - a move which reduced drinks sales .
" in the case of spirits , this has resulted in the percentage of double measures reducing from 90 % to 50 % in the course of the last two years , " wetherspoon said in a statement .
wetherspoon added it had also been experiencing " a considerable rise in competition from supermarkets " , off licences and drinks bought abroad as more consumers opted to enjoy a drink at home .
despite the decline in customers , full year sales rose 3 % , or by £ 22.7m to £ 809.9 .
smoking bans bite the number of new openings slowed to 13 from 28 last year - with sales at new pubs offsetting a decline elsewhere , wetherspoon said , adding that like-for-like sales dipped 0.6 % .
meanwhile , its decision to introduce smoking bans at 36 of its 655 pubs had resulted in a 7 % drop in turnover and a decline in profit margins at those pubs .
critics have claimed that pubs should wait until a ban comes into force , as is widely expected .
but wetherspoon said : " we feel that it is better to take the initiative , rather than adopting a non-smoking policy at the same time as everyone else , without significant previous experience of its impact . "
however , the company added that the move had led to higher costs - particularly labour costs , as a result of higher food sales at the converted pubs .
annual operating margins have slipped across the board to 8.7 % from 9.9 % last year mainly as a result of rising utility , labour and repair costs it added .
in an effort to improve margins , wetherspoon has been cutting costs at head office and its pub estate .

opera is taking its browser into mobile phones the boss of norwegian company opera jon von tetzschner does not mind being called a survivor or an underdog .
" we just do n't like quitting , " says mr von tetzschner .
" we 're not quitters . "
it has been a long distance run for opera , whose story starts back in 1992 .
mr von tetzschner and programming buddy geir ivarsoey were working for telenor , the norwegian telecom giant .
they had just finished one project and were looking for another .
" geir and i were restless , " recalls mr von tetzschner .
" we needed a new project , and we found the web .
we set up a web server and did a lot of other web things .
" then , we decided we should make a web browser .
we started that in 1994 , and in six months time , we had a prototype . "
those were early days for web browsers .
netscape was still a big name , and microsoft 's internet explorer was just emerging on the scene .
mr von tetzschner and mr ivarsoey wanted to take their technology and create their own company .
they made their case to karl klingsheim , who was the then head of research and development at telenor .
" we 'd just heard about microsoft explorer and netscape emerging on the internet , " says mr klingsheim .
" and then these two kids basically came to me and said , ' we would very much like to form our own company , and we 're going to compete with microsoft and netscape , who by the way give their products away for free ' . "
mr klingsheim doubted the wisdom of their decision .
but he told them they could have the technology as they were determined to press ahead .
big in poland telenor gave the two no financial help .
in fact , the pair used $ 7,000 of their own money to start opera .
their goal was to create a browser that was leaner and meaner than the others .
this is not surprising , considering that opera 's first paying job was to make a browser that ran on 386 computers .
we want the internet to be available for everyone , on any device jon von tetzschner , opera ceo opera eventually made its program available for download on the web .
it has proved popular .
today , there is a small international army of dedicated opera users .
the company estimates that 10 to 15 million people use opera daily .
there are currently about four million downloads of the browser per month .
the browser is free but it contains banner ads .
to remove the ads , users have to pay $ 39 -lrb- £ 21 -rrb- per license .
one country where opera is especially popular is poland .
" we like to feel good as poles , and we say we have a spirit of independence , " says an opera employee nicknamed moose , who is originally from poland .
" we do n't like to be subjected to any evil power , including a company not to be named which has a base in redmond , washington . "
moose is referring , of course , to microsoft .
the company 's internet explorer currently dominates the browser market on pc-based desktops and laptops .
that , however , may be changing .
recently , mozilla 's firefox browser has been coming on strong , and taking some of microsoft 's market share .
opera employee charles mccathienevile , who is originally from australia , is not worried about the success of firefox , even though it is a competitor .
" it 's not exactly that firefox is going to show us the way , " he says .
" anything can take off for a number of reasons , not all of which are particularly good ones .
" but the fact that people are looking around , and are starting to think beyond what came loaded on their computers , that is really the best thing for me .
that 's encouraging . "
browsing on the go computers are only part of the story , though .
opera , like many other hi-tech companies , is thinking well beyond desktops and laptops .
handheld devices and web-enabled cell phones are changing the browser market .
browser market internet explorer : 87.2 % firefox : 8.07 % safari : 2.13 % netscape : 1.50 % opera : 0.49 % source : netapplications , july 2005 " people 's web-browsing experience is going to change significantly during the next five years , " says opera 's tim altman , who is originally from the us .
" we 'll see people realising that the desktop is only part of their web-browsing experience .
" a lot of it is going to happen on mobile phones , or pdas or mp3 players , things that you can carry around with you and access the net .
" people are going to want to have the same experience on their mobile devices that they have on the desktop . "
but making a mobile phone browser work has not been easy , according to opera 's eskil sivertsen .
" there are two main challenges .
one is the size of the web page .
a web page is typically designed for a computer screen .
so , how do you fit that onto a small screen ? "
" the other issue , " says mr sivertsen , " is how do you get a powerful web application to run on a device that has very limited hardware capacity ? "
opera is pouring a lot of time and money into finding answers to those questions .
the pay-off is potentially huge , particularly in developing countries where mobile phones outnumber personal computers by a wide margin .
" we want the internet to be available for everyone , on any device , " says opera ceo jon von tetzschner .
" that means we want it to run on older computers , because not everyone can afford new computers every year .
we 'd like it to run on other devices , and for it to run on slower networks . "
mr von tetzschner says the company would like to develop projects in africa and india .
for now , opera is expanding its operations where the money is already good , in the us , japan , and china .

moose is referring , of course , to microsoft .

opera employee charles mccathienevile , who is originally from australia , is not worried about the success of firefox , even though it is a competitor .
" it 's not exactly that firefox is going to show us the way , " he says .

" but the fact that people are looking around , and are starting to think beyond what came loaded on their computers , that is really the best thing for me .
that 's encouraging . "
browsing on the go computers are only part of the story , though .
opera , like many other hi-tech companies , is thinking well beyond desktops and laptops .
handheld devices and web-enabled cell phones are changing the browser market .
browser market internet explorer : 87.2 % firefox : 8.07 % safari : 2.13 % netscape : 1.50 % opera : 0.49 % source : netapplications , july 2005 " people 's web-browsing experience is going to change significantly during the next five years , " says opera 's tim altman , who is originally from the us .
" we 'll see people realising that the desktop is only part of their web-browsing experience .
" a lot of it is going to happen on mobile phones , or pdas or mp3 players , things that you can carry around with you and access the net .
" people are going to want to have the same experience on their mobile devices that they have on the desktop . "
but making a mobile phone browser work has not been easy , according to opera 's eskil sivertsen .
" there are two main challenges .
one is the size of the web page .
a web page is typically designed for a computer screen .
so , how do you fit that onto a small screen ? "
" the other issue , " says mr sivertsen , " is how do you get a powerful web application to run on a device that has very limited hardware capacity ? "
opera is pouring a lot of time and money into finding answers to those questions .
the pay-off is potentially huge , particularly in developing countries where mobile phones outnumber personal computers by a wide margin .
" we want the internet to be available for everyone , on any device , " says opera ceo jon von tetzschner .
" that means we want it to run on older computers , because not everyone can afford new computers every year .
we 'd like it to run on other devices , and for it to run on slower networks . "
mr von tetzschner says the company would like to develop projects in africa and india .
for now , opera is expanding its operations where the money is already good , in the us , japan , and china .

opera is taking its browser into mobile phones the boss of norwegian company opera jon von tetzschner does not mind being called a survivor or an underdog .
" we just do n't like quitting , " says mr von tetzschner .
" we 're not quitters . "
it has been a long distance run for opera , whose story starts back in 1992 .
mr von tetzschner and programming buddy geir ivarsoey were working for telenor , the norwegian telecom giant .
they had just finished one project and were looking for another .
" geir and i were restless , " recalls mr von tetzschner .
" we needed a new project , and we found the web .
we set up a web server and did a lot of other web things .
" then , we decided we should make a web browser .
we started that in 1994 , and in six months time , we had a prototype . "
those were early days for web browsers .
netscape was still a big name , and microsoft 's internet explorer was just emerging on the scene .
mr von tetzschner and mr ivarsoey wanted to take their technology and create their own company .
they made their case to karl klingsheim , who was the then head of research and development at telenor .
" we 'd just heard about microsoft explorer and netscape emerging on the internet , " says mr klingsheim .
" and then these two kids basically came to me and said , ' we would very much like to form our own company , and we 're going to compete with microsoft and netscape , who by the way give their products away for free ' . "
mr klingsheim doubted the wisdom of their decision .
but he told them they could have the technology as they were determined to press ahead .
big in poland telenor gave the two no financial help .
in fact , the pair used $ 7,000 of their own money to start opera .
their goal was to create a browser that was leaner and meaner than the others .
this is not surprising , considering that opera 's first paying job was to make a browser that ran on 386 computers .
we want the internet to be available for everyone , on any device jon von tetzschner , opera ceo opera eventually made its program available for download on the web .
it has proved popular .
today , there is a small international army of dedicated opera users .
the company estimates that 10 to 15 million people use opera daily .
there are currently about four million downloads of the browser per month .
the browser is free but it contains banner ads .
to remove the ads , users have to pay $ 39 -lrb- £ 21 -rrb- per license .
one country where opera is especially popular is poland .
" we like to feel good as poles , and we say we have a spirit of independence , " says an opera employee nicknamed moose , who is originally from poland .
" we do n't like to be subjected to any evil power , including a company not to be named which has a base in redmond , washington . "
moose is referring , of course , to microsoft .
the company 's internet explorer currently dominates the browser market on pc-based desktops and laptops .
that , however , may be changing .
recently , mozilla 's firefox browser has been coming on strong , and taking some of microsoft 's market share .
opera employee charles mccathienevile , who is originally from australia , is not worried about the success of firefox , even though it is a competitor .
" it 's not exactly that firefox is going to show us the way , " he says .
" anything can take off for a number of reasons , not all of which are particularly good ones .
" but the fact that people are looking around , and are starting to think beyond what came loaded on their computers , that is really the best thing for me .
that 's encouraging . "
browsing on the go computers are only part of the story , though .
opera , like many other hi-tech companies , is thinking well beyond desktops and laptops .
handheld devices and web-enabled cell phones are changing the browser market .
browser market internet explorer : 87.2 % firefox : 8.07 % safari : 2.13 % netscape : 1.50 % opera : 0.49 % source : netapplications , july 2005 " people 's web-browsing experience is going to change significantly during the next five years , " says opera 's tim altman , who is originally from the us .
" we 'll see people realising that the desktop is only part of their web-browsing experience .
" a lot of it is going to happen on mobile phones , or pdas or mp3 players , things that you can carry around with you and access the net .
" people are going to want to have the same experience on their mobile devices that they have on the desktop . "
but making a mobile phone browser work has not been easy , according to opera 's eskil sivertsen .
" there are two main challenges .
one is the size of the web page .
a web page is typically designed for a computer screen .
so , how do you fit that onto a small screen ? "
" the other issue , " says mr sivertsen , " is how do you get a powerful web application to run on a device that has very limited hardware capacity ? "
opera is pouring a lot of time and money into finding answers to those questions .
the pay-off is potentially huge , particularly in developing countries where mobile phones outnumber personal computers by a wide margin .
" we want the internet to be available for everyone , on any device , " says opera ceo jon von tetzschner .
" that means we want it to run on older computers , because not everyone can afford new computers every year .
we 'd like it to run on other devices , and for it to run on slower networks . "
mr von tetzschner says the company would like to develop projects in africa and india .

wipeout pure psygnosis ' futuristic racer flew the flag for the original playstation as the cool , new plaything for the hip masses , offering sterling gameplay topped off with creative flair and a techno soundtrack that begged for decibels .
offering more gravity-defying race thrills dressed in designer cool , sony 's studio liverpool has crafted a blazingly fast showcase of the psp 's grunt .
loaded with all-new environments and ships , plus a soundtrack created by top beat-droppers , wipeout pure even promises future content for download .
an essential purchase .
medievil : resurrection you can not keep a good corpse down , especially when his franchise sells by the bucketload .
that is sony 's thinking behind this handheld entry into the adventures of sir dan fortesque , star of the 1998 playstation adventure , medievil .
the evil zarok has returned , turning day into night and raising an undead army to conquer the land .
cue another blend of cartoon 3d platform action with rpg undertones , as players guide the resurrected dan through the land of gallowmere .
once again , the comedy-gothic visual style owes a lot to the movies of tim burton , with the character designs screaming nightmare before christmas .
expect a solid third-person romp with multiplayer mini-games to help shake the cobwebs from your wi-fi capabilities .
hopefully the problems that dogged the originals , dodgy camera angles , sluggish controls and repetitive gameplay , will not be as apparent in miniature .
virtua tennis : world tour wimbledon may be over , but our thoughts can once again return to strawberries and cream with a portable version of sega 's classic ball whacker , which tightens up the series ' already superb gameplay and adds a roster of licensed stars and new mini-games .
frighteningly realistic players move perfectly around the court , whilst the eye candy is laced with realistic nuances , from the spray of dust off clay courts to the drifting cloud shadows at wimbledon .
it is not just a visual triumph , though .
your ears are treated to nigh-on perfect sound effects , from the thwock of an ace to the squeak of overpriced trainers , while wi-fi multiplayer lets up to 16 players challenge each other .
virtua tennis on psp is shaping up to be the greatest example of electronic tennis since super tennis on the snes .
midnight club 3 : dub edition it is a sign of the times that auto-philes are ditching top gear and its permed host in favour of the likes of mtv 's pimp my ride .
tricked-out cars with more bling than elizabeth duke are the order of the day , and rockstar 's midnight club 3 : dub edition has duly obliged , bringing in the auto express for the hip-hop nation , dub magazine , to style its fleet .
the third in the illegal street-racing series has players roaring through the moonlit streets of atlanta , san diego and detroit , choosing rides from a garage stuffed with suvs , import tuners , muscle cars , choppers and luxury rides which can be tarted up with the latest rims and trims .
six-player multiplayer action and a huge selection of arcade modes are ruined somewhat by incredibly long load times , as much as a minute in some cases .
but while midnight club has underground chic , there is big racing competition from ridge racer and wipeout .
everybody 's golf do not let the cutesy-pie presentation fool you .
with pitch-perfect controls and realistic physics , everybody 's golf promise to garner the cult following it did on the original playstation .
ten funky golfers and five caddies are available to tackle the virtual fairways using old-fashioned button-tapping swings .
but beneath its cartoon cast of bug-eyed anime characters lies a surprisingly mean game of golf .
ridge racer featuring a greatest hits of courses from arguably the greatest arcade racing franchise ever , ridge racer was the jewel in the crown of the psp 's japanese launch .
the 24 circuits take the best elements of the series and allows up to eight players to tear up the asphalt simultaneously , while a new nitro boost feature will have burnout 's lawyers spinning .
with spot-on controls , slick visuals and ear-flaying sound , ridge racer is the slickest of a strong launch stable for petrol-heads .
lumines puzzlers and handhelds make great bedfellows , and lumines is the obligatory music-themed block-stacker for grey-matter scratching on the go .
the 24 action-packed levels , each with their own musical theme , offer a mix of artistic achievement and addictive , pick-up-and-play gameplay .
the game from ubisoft could be the sleeper hit of the launch batch .

wipeout pure psygnosis ' futuristic racer flew the flag for the original playstation as the cool , new plaything for the hip masses , offering sterling gameplay topped off with creative flair and a techno soundtrack that begged for decibels .
offering more gravity-defying race thrills dressed in designer cool , sony 's studio liverpool has crafted a blazingly fast showcase of the psp 's grunt .
loaded with all-new environments and ships , plus a soundtrack created by top beat-droppers , wipeout pure even promises future content for download .
an essential purchase .
medievil : resurrection you can not keep a good corpse down , especially when his franchise sells by the bucketload .
that is sony 's thinking behind this handheld entry into the adventures of sir dan fortesque , star of the 1998 playstation adventure , medievil .
the evil zarok has returned , turning day into night and raising an undead army to conquer the land .
cue another blend of cartoon 3d platform action with rpg undertones , as players guide the resurrected dan through the land of gallowmere .
once again , the comedy-gothic visual style owes a lot to the movies of tim burton , with the character designs screaming nightmare before christmas .
expect a solid third-person romp with multiplayer mini-games to help shake the cobwebs from your wi-fi capabilities .
hopefully the problems that dogged the originals , dodgy camera angles , sluggish controls and repetitive gameplay , will not be as apparent in miniature .
virtua tennis : world tour wimbledon may be over , but our thoughts can once again return to strawberries and cream with a portable version of sega 's classic ball whacker , which tightens up the series ' already superb gameplay and adds a roster of licensed stars and new mini-games .
frighteningly realistic players move perfectly around the court , whilst the eye candy is laced with realistic nuances , from the spray of dust off clay courts to the drifting cloud shadows at wimbledon .
it is not just a visual triumph , though .
your ears are treated to nigh-on perfect sound effects , from the thwock of an ace to the squeak of overpriced trainers , while wi-fi multiplayer lets up to 16 players challenge each other .
