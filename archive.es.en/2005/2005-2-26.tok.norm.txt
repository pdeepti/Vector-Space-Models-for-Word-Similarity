program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.02.2005 fischer goes on offensive in visa affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer 's speech was well received by greens delegates german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted saturday he made mistakes in an affair involving the misuse of visas by criminal human traffickers from eastern europe , but he remained defiant amid calls to resign . " i 've made mistakes , " fischer told a cologne meeting of his greens party , the junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition .
" but that has nothing to do with the party , " he added .
fischer is the greens ' most high-profile figure . fischer , whose poll ratings have dived over the controversy , acknowledged that under his foreign ministry stewardship since 1998 two decisions had been made that were to damaging visa policy .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . germany 's conservative opposition claims lack of vigilance by fischer meant " hundreds of thousands " of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed , thereby allegedly fostering organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , said on saturday fischer had failed to uphold the duties of his office and therefore had to go .
" if he had an ounce of self-respect left he 'd know what he has to do , " merkel said .
" plenty of ministers have resigned over less . " but fischer attacked the conservatives for opportunistically labeling all eastern europeans as lawbreakers .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they can demand my resignation , but they must stop stigmatizing an entire people as criminals just for an election campaign ! " fischer 's speech to the greens in north rhine-westphalia was keenly awaited by many hoping to gauge his strategy before he testifies in the coming weeks before a parliamentary investigation into the affair .
his feisty reply energized both those in his party and members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . fischer has the full backing of schröder , who this weekend again dismissed demands by the opposition for his resignation .
in an interview with the frankfurt allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schröder made clear fischer was going nowhere : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister ! " less popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't you like me anymore ?
but fischer lost his standing as germany 's most popular politician for the first time in three years in a key poll friday amid the ongoing scandal .
the " politbarometer " published by public broadcaster zdf showed that the affair over the abuse of tourist was taking a political toll . after more than three years leading the ranks of germany 's " top 10 most important political officials " , fischer slipped to second place with a rating of 0.8 , down by half from the 1.6 he tallied last month .
five would the highest score in a scale that assesses an official 's public profile , image and likability . he was bested by lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the conservative opposition christian democrats , who has been considered a dark-horse candidate for the chancellery in next year 's general election .
wulff benefited from fischer 's slide , but also from a poll quirk that eliminates the responses of people who said they did not know the politician well enough to judge .
half the respondents gave this response for wulff . the visa scandal comes at an inopportune time for schröder 's government , with his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- unable to break a marathon losing streak in a series of state elections .
the spd suffered a surprise loss in schleswig-holstein last sunday and will face a crucial test in a poll in the most populous state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 . until then , it will be scrambling to control the political damage from the visa affair . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

" when the holocaust is taken up or mentioned in political , social or church speeches a particularly sensitive language is always needed , " lehmann said in a statement .
jewish leaders in germany were upset over the pope 's new book " memory and identity " which evoked the holocaust and the " legal extermination " that governments sanction by allowing abortion .
the book echoed similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who compared the mass murder of herod , hitler and stalin with abortion . he later expressed regret for his comparison .
abortion not prosecuted it 's been thirty years since germany 's constitutional court struck down a law that would have legalized abortion in the first 12 weeks .
to this day , article 218 in the german civil code makes abortion an offense - but it wo n't be prosecuted .
one of the cornerstones in germany when it comes to a possible pregnancy termination is counseling .
a number of organizations in germany counsel pregnant mothers encountering problems .
an abortion costs around € 400 at professional clinics in berlin .
because public health funds will not pay , women in the low-income bracket are supported by funds set aside by the city 's government .
before that , an independently financed fund supported by private donations helped women who were in a tough financial situation .
for women from catholic-dominated poland , berlin has become a prime destination if they are seeking to terminate a pregnancy .
they are familiar with all the addresses of doctors who perform abortions despite what for them is a very expensive procedure .
german catholic church in dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii demanded that the members of the german catholic church would not sign anything that would lead to an abortion the catholic church in germany , dictated by the pontiff in rome , has taken a hard stance against abortion .
an ongoing debate in the late 1990 's led between pope john paul and the german catholic church led to a papal decree that ended counseling that would lead to an abortion .
until the end of 2000 , church organizations could counsel women who were having difficulties of any kind during the pregnancy .
if the woman did decide on termination , a church counselor would sign the mandatory paperwork declaring that the woman went through counseling .
as of january 1 , 2001 , the german catholic church suspended the signing of any forms that would accede to a woman 's desire for an abortion .
that would have to happen elsewhere .
many in the german catholic church had argued that the counseling tool was effective in combating abortion and now feel they have lost a tool to persuade a woman to carry out a pregnancy to term .
meanwhile , article 218 in the german civil code still makes abortion illegal .
yet the fact that the state does not prosecute is a compromise that silvia heyer , from the pro familia counseling group , can and must accept .
she believes that the law correctly states that only a woman has a feeling as to what is acceptable in her life and " no men and no catholic priests " would know this feeling . henriette wrege -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pope 's new book angers jewish leaders a new book by pope john ii has caused an outcry among germany 's jewish groups due to passages that some critics say compare abortion to the horrors of the holocaust .

jackson said he had been " appalled and disappointed " when he first saw the photographs of the iraqi victims produced as evidence at the trial .
hoon said he was " profoundly disturbed " by the photographs , adding that he agreed with jackson " that the incidents depicted do not reflect typical behavior standards of the british army .
" we also agree that it is right to apologize on behalf of the army to the victims and the people of iraq , " hoon said , adding 22 soldiers in all , including those sentenced friday , were involved in abuse allegations .
" the army sets high standards and demand that they are met .
the recent court martial has demonstrated that those who fail to meet those standards are called to account , " hoon said . " the vast majority of service men and women do , however , perform to the very highest of standards .
their service in iraq has been outstanding and we are right to be proud of this , " the defense minister said .
the most senior of the trio sentenced here , corporal daniel kenyon , 33 , was given an 18-month prison sentence after being found guilty of three charges including failing to report the mistreatment of captured looters at an aid camp near basra in may 2003 .
lance corporal mark cooley , 25 , was sentenced to two years in jail after being found guilty of two charges including driving a forklift truck with a bound iraqi suspended from the prongs .
a series of photos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance corporal larkin standing on an iraqi detainee and corporal kenyon taking a photograph .
a photograph of the helpless iraqi dangling from the forklift was among a series of photos taken by soldiers at the aid camp known as camp bread basket .
other photographs showed naked iraqi men being forced to simulate sex .
the third defendant , lance corporal darren larkin , 30 , was sentenced to 140 days , just under five months , in jail after he pleaded guilty to assault .
he had been pictured standing on an iraqi .
all three soldiers from the royal regiment of fusiliers were dishonorably discharged from the army by a panel of seven senior officers and a judge at the court martial in an army barracks in northern germany .
the abuse came to light when another soldier submitted a film of the photographs for development at a shop in england .
a shop worker called the police after being shocked by the images .
the soldier who took the photographs , fusilier gary bartlam , was sentenced to 18 months in prison and discharged from the army in an earlier court martial .
in sentencing , judge advocate michael hunter said that an operation launched by the soldiers ' superior officers to detain the looters had gone " much further than was intended " .
but he said what happened " could have been avoided " .
" what you did was not done to discourage the looting , it was done to produce trophy photographs , " he said , adding that some of those involved in the abuse had not been brought to justice .
the images of the abuse prompted comparisons with the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib , which was depicted in a series of photographs taken by us guards .
the british press has criticized the fact that all the officers who planned or supervised the operation to round up the looters , known as operation ali baba , have since been promoted .
prosecution lawyers told the court martial that the order to work the looters " hard " contravened the geneva convention .

major dan taylor told the trial he had denied ordering that the iraqis be " beasted " , a term used by the british army to indicate making someone work until they are exhausted .
taylor admitted however he had thrown away notebooks containing information on the operation because he had moved to a smaller house . the image of the british army in iraq , the biggest contingent in the violence-wracked country after the americans , was set to suffer more damage .
seven soldiers from the 3rd parachute regiment have already been charged with murder and violent disorder , and faced courts martial over the death of an iraqi civilian in southern iraq around the time of the incidents examined in the osnabrueck trial .

" i 've made mistakes , " fischer told a cologne meeting of his greens party , the junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition .
" but that has nothing to do with the party , " he added .
fischer is the greens ' most high-profile figure . fischer , whose poll ratings have dived over the controversy , acknowledged that under his foreign ministry stewardship since 1998 two decisions had been made that were to damaging visa policy .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . germany 's conservative opposition claims lack of vigilance by fischer meant " hundreds of thousands " of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed , thereby allegedly fostering organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , said on saturday fischer had failed to uphold the duties of his office and therefore had to go .
" if he had an ounce of self-respect left he 'd know what he has to do , " merkel said .
" plenty of ministers have resigned over less . " but fischer attacked the conservatives for opportunistically labeling all eastern europeans as lawbreakers .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they can demand my resignation , but they must stop stigmatizing an entire people as criminals just for an election campaign ! " fischer 's speech to the greens in north rhine-westphalia was keenly awaited by many hoping to gauge his strategy before he testifies in the coming weeks before a parliamentary investigation into the affair .
his feisty reply energized both those in his party and members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . fischer has the full backing of schröder , who this weekend again dismissed demands by the opposition for his resignation .
in an interview with the frankfurt allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schröder made clear fischer was going nowhere : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister ! " less popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't you like me anymore ?
but fischer lost his standing as germany 's most popular politician for the first time in three years in a key poll friday amid the ongoing scandal .
the " politbarometer " published by public broadcaster zdf showed that the affair over the abuse of tourist was taking a political toll . after more than three years leading the ranks of germany 's " top 10 most important political officials " , fischer slipped to second place with a rating of 0.8 , down by half from the 1.6 he tallied last month .
five would the highest score in a scale that assesses an official 's public profile , image and likability . he was bested by lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the conservative opposition christian democrats , who has been considered a dark-horse candidate for the chancellery in next year 's general election .
wulff benefited from fischer 's slide , but also from a poll quirk that eliminates the responses of people who said they did not know the politician well enough to judge .
half the respondents gave this response for wulff . the visa scandal comes at an inopportune time for schröder 's government , with his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- unable to break a marathon losing streak in a series of state elections .
the spd suffered a surprise loss in schleswig-holstein last sunday and will face a crucial test in a poll in the most populous state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 . until then , it will be scrambling to control the political damage from the visa affair . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

jackson said he had been " appalled and disappointed " when he first saw the photographs of the iraqi victims produced as evidence at the trial .
hoon said he was " profoundly disturbed " by the photographs , adding that he agreed with jackson " that the incidents depicted do not reflect typical behavior standards of the british army .
" we also agree that it is right to apologize on behalf of the army to the victims and the people of iraq , " hoon said , adding 22 soldiers in all , including those sentenced friday , were involved in abuse allegations .
" the army sets high standards and demand that they are met .
the recent court martial has demonstrated that those who fail to meet those standards are called to account , " hoon said . " the vast majority of service men and women do , however , perform to the very highest of standards .
their service in iraq has been outstanding and we are right to be proud of this , " the defense minister said .
the most senior of the trio sentenced here , corporal daniel kenyon , 33 , was given an 18-month prison sentence after being found guilty of three charges including failing to report the mistreatment of captured looters at an aid camp near basra in may 2003 .
lance corporal mark cooley , 25 , was sentenced to two years in jail after being found guilty of two charges including driving a forklift truck with a bound iraqi suspended from the prongs .
a series of photos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance corporal larkin standing on an iraqi detainee and corporal kenyon taking a photograph .
a photograph of the helpless iraqi dangling from the forklift was among a series of photos taken by soldiers at the aid camp known as camp bread basket .
other photographs showed naked iraqi men being forced to simulate sex .
the third defendant , lance corporal darren larkin , 30 , was sentenced to 140 days , just under five months , in jail after he pleaded guilty to assault .
he had been pictured standing on an iraqi .
all three soldiers from the royal regiment of fusiliers were dishonorably discharged from the army by a panel of seven senior officers and a judge at the court martial in an army barracks in northern germany .
the abuse came to light when another soldier submitted a film of the photographs for development at a shop in england .
a shop worker called the police after being shocked by the images .
the soldier who took the photographs , fusilier gary bartlam , was sentenced to 18 months in prison and discharged from the army in an earlier court martial .
in sentencing , judge advocate michael hunter said that an operation launched by the soldiers ' superior officers to detain the looters had gone " much further than was intended " .
but he said what happened " could have been avoided " .
" what you did was not done to discourage the looting , it was done to produce trophy photographs , " he said , adding that some of those involved in the abuse had not been brought to justice .
the images of the abuse prompted comparisons with the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib , which was depicted in a series of photographs taken by us guards .
the british press has criticized the fact that all the officers who planned or supervised the operation to round up the looters , known as operation ali baba , have since been promoted .
prosecution lawyers told the court martial that the order to work the looters " hard " contravened the geneva convention .

major dan taylor told the trial he had denied ordering that the iraqis be " beasted " , a term used by the british army to indicate making someone work until they are exhausted .
taylor admitted however he had thrown away notebooks containing information on the operation because he had moved to a smaller house . the image of the british army in iraq , the biggest contingent in the violence-wracked country after the americans , was set to suffer more damage .
seven soldiers from the 3rd parachute regiment have already been charged with murder and violent disorder , and faced courts martial over the death of an iraqi civilian in southern iraq around the time of the incidents examined in the osnabrueck trial .

" i 've made mistakes , " fischer told a cologne meeting of his greens party , the junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition .
" but that has nothing to do with the party , " he added .
fischer is the greens ' most high-profile figure . fischer , whose poll ratings have dived over the controversy , acknowledged that under his foreign ministry stewardship since 1998 two decisions had been made that were to damaging visa policy .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . germany 's conservative opposition claims lack of vigilance by fischer meant " hundreds of thousands " of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed , thereby allegedly fostering organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , said on saturday fischer had failed to uphold the duties of his office and therefore had to go .
" if he had an ounce of self-respect left he 'd know what he has to do , " merkel said .
" plenty of ministers have resigned over less . " but fischer attacked the conservatives for opportunistically labeling all eastern europeans as lawbreakers .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they can demand my resignation , but they must stop stigmatizing an entire people as criminals just for an election campaign ! " fischer 's speech to the greens in north rhine-westphalia was keenly awaited by many hoping to gauge his strategy before he testifies in the coming weeks before a parliamentary investigation into the affair .
his feisty reply energized both those in his party and members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . fischer has the full backing of schröder , who this weekend again dismissed demands by the opposition for his resignation .
in an interview with the frankfurt allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schröder made clear fischer was going nowhere : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister ! " less popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't you like me anymore ?
but fischer lost his standing as germany 's most popular politician for the first time in three years in a key poll friday amid the ongoing scandal .
the " politbarometer " published by public broadcaster zdf showed that the affair over the abuse of tourist was taking a political toll . after more than three years leading the ranks of germany 's " top 10 most important political officials " , fischer slipped to second place with a rating of 0.8 , down by half from the 1.6 he tallied last month .
five would the highest score in a scale that assesses an official 's public profile , image and likability . he was bested by lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the conservative opposition christian democrats , who has been considered a dark-horse candidate for the chancellery in next year 's general election .
wulff benefited from fischer 's slide , but also from a poll quirk that eliminates the responses of people who said they did not know the politician well enough to judge .
half the respondents gave this response for wulff . the visa scandal comes at an inopportune time for schröder 's government , with his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- unable to break a marathon losing streak in a series of state elections .
the spd suffered a surprise loss in schleswig-holstein last sunday and will face a crucial test in a poll in the most populous state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 . until then , it will be scrambling to control the political damage from the visa affair . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

a bad pass , a missed penalty kick were typical of hamburg 's luck . some days a team can play excellent soccer and nevertheless walk off the field losers .
that was the case for thomas doll 's hamburger sv who dropped their match against their nearest bundesliga table competitors , hertha berlin , 4-1 .
and the comments after the game were indicative of just how obvious the players on both clubs felt .
the man who started the barrage for berlin , claudio reina , had nothing but praise for the north germans .
" hamburg played really well . "

" it was probably our worst game all season but we won . "
fourth minute goal set the tone just as the players were getting warmed up , hertha were the beneficiaries of a free-kick . with his new red colored hair , marcelinho got the kick past the wall .
claudio reina was on the spot and drove the ball into the goal .
a shock for hamburg but they did n't take it as such .
hamburg dominated play in the next ten minutes and had the better opportunities .
but as so frequently happens , a mistake at midfield led to a goal .
marcelinho won a ball in the center circle and found gilberto who slyly beat two defenders and as keeper pieckenhagen came out , put the ball between the goalie 's legs . after that the game was for all intents and purposes over .

this time yildiray bastürk won a ball at midfield , stormed down the center of the field .
pieckenhagen could stop his shot from 16 meters out but it landed on marcelinho 's foot and he scored into the empty net .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.02.2005 german cardinal smoothes abortion row großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cardinal lehmann called for sensitivity an official from the catholic church in germany has smoothed over a row with jewish leaders angered over pope john paul ii 's recent book which he juxtaposes the holocaust and abortion . cardinal karl lehmann , head of the german catholic bishops ' conference , said on friday that he had reached agreement with the president of german jewish council , paul spiegel , over incomparable status of the holocaust .
" when the holocaust is taken up or mentioned in political , social or church speeches a particularly sensitive language is always needed , " lehmann said in a statement .
jewish leaders in germany were upset over the pope 's new book " memory and identity " which evoked the holocaust and the " legal extermination " that governments sanction by allowing abortion .
the book echoed similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who compared the mass murder of herod , hitler and stalin with abortion . he later expressed regret for his comparison .
abortion not prosecuted it 's been thirty years since germany 's constitutional court struck down a law that would have legalized abortion in the first 12 weeks .
to this day , article 218 in the german civil code makes abortion an offense - but it wo n't be prosecuted .
one of the cornerstones in germany when it comes to a possible pregnancy termination is counseling .
a number of organizations in germany counsel pregnant mothers encountering problems .
an abortion costs around € 400 at professional clinics in berlin .
because public health funds will not pay , women in the low-income bracket are supported by funds set aside by the city 's government .
before that , an independently financed fund supported by private donations helped women who were in a tough financial situation .
for women from catholic-dominated poland , berlin has become a prime destination if they are seeking to terminate a pregnancy .
they are familiar with all the addresses of doctors who perform abortions despite what for them is a very expensive procedure .
german catholic church in dilemma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope john paul ii demanded that the members of the german catholic church would not sign anything that would lead to an abortion the catholic church in germany , dictated by the pontiff in rome , has taken a hard stance against abortion .
an ongoing debate in the late 1990 's led between pope john paul and the german catholic church led to a papal decree that ended counseling that would lead to an abortion .
until the end of 2000 , church organizations could counsel women who were having difficulties of any kind during the pregnancy .
if the woman did decide on termination , a church counselor would sign the mandatory paperwork declaring that the woman went through counseling .
as of january 1 , 2001 , the german catholic church suspended the signing of any forms that would accede to a woman 's desire for an abortion .
that would have to happen elsewhere .
many in the german catholic church had argued that the counseling tool was effective in combating abortion and now feel they have lost a tool to persuade a woman to carry out a pregnancy to term .
meanwhile , article 218 in the german civil code still makes abortion illegal .
yet the fact that the state does not prosecute is a compromise that silvia heyer , from the pro familia counseling group , can and must accept .

jackson said he had been " appalled and disappointed " when he first saw the photographs of the iraqi victims produced as evidence at the trial .
hoon said he was " profoundly disturbed " by the photographs , adding that he agreed with jackson " that the incidents depicted do not reflect typical behavior standards of the british army .
" we also agree that it is right to apologize on behalf of the army to the victims and the people of iraq , " hoon said , adding 22 soldiers in all , including those sentenced friday , were involved in abuse allegations .
" the army sets high standards and demand that they are met .
the recent court martial has demonstrated that those who fail to meet those standards are called to account , " hoon said . " the vast majority of service men and women do , however , perform to the very highest of standards .
their service in iraq has been outstanding and we are right to be proud of this , " the defense minister said .
the most senior of the trio sentenced here , corporal daniel kenyon , 33 , was given an 18-month prison sentence after being found guilty of three charges including failing to report the mistreatment of captured looters at an aid camp near basra in may 2003 .
lance corporal mark cooley , 25 , was sentenced to two years in jail after being found guilty of two charges including driving a forklift truck with a bound iraqi suspended from the prongs .
a series of photos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance corporal larkin standing on an iraqi detainee and corporal kenyon taking a photograph .
a photograph of the helpless iraqi dangling from the forklift was among a series of photos taken by soldiers at the aid camp known as camp bread basket .
other photographs showed naked iraqi men being forced to simulate sex .
the third defendant , lance corporal darren larkin , 30 , was sentenced to 140 days , just under five months , in jail after he pleaded guilty to assault .
he had been pictured standing on an iraqi .
all three soldiers from the royal regiment of fusiliers were dishonorably discharged from the army by a panel of seven senior officers and a judge at the court martial in an army barracks in northern germany .
the abuse came to light when another soldier submitted a film of the photographs for development at a shop in england .
a shop worker called the police after being shocked by the images .
the soldier who took the photographs , fusilier gary bartlam , was sentenced to 18 months in prison and discharged from the army in an earlier court martial .
in sentencing , judge advocate michael hunter said that an operation launched by the soldiers ' superior officers to detain the looters had gone " much further than was intended " .
but he said what happened " could have been avoided " .
" what you did was not done to discourage the looting , it was done to produce trophy photographs , " he said , adding that some of those involved in the abuse had not been brought to justice .
the images of the abuse prompted comparisons with the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib , which was depicted in a series of photographs taken by us guards .
the british press has criticized the fact that all the officers who planned or supervised the operation to round up the looters , known as operation ali baba , have since been promoted .
prosecution lawyers told the court martial that the order to work the looters " hard " contravened the geneva convention .
" beasting " ordered ?
major dan taylor told the trial he had denied ordering that the iraqis be " beasted " , a term used by the british army to indicate making someone work until they are exhausted .
taylor admitted however he had thrown away notebooks containing information on the operation because he had moved to a smaller house . the image of the british army in iraq , the biggest contingent in the violence-wracked country after the americans , was set to suffer more damage .
seven soldiers from the 3rd parachute regiment have already been charged with murder and violent disorder , and faced courts martial over the death of an iraqi civilian in southern iraq around the time of the incidents examined in the osnabrueck trial .
the times newspaper said on thursday that as many as 11 more soldiers could face court martial over a beating in which an iraqi civilian died , and other instances of abuse . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de torture or only mistreatment ?

" when the holocaust is taken up or mentioned in political , social or church speeches a particularly sensitive language is always needed , " lehmann said in a statement .
jewish leaders in germany were upset over the pope 's new book " memory and identity " which evoked the holocaust and the " legal extermination " that governments sanction by allowing abortion .
the book echoed similar remarks made by the cardinal of cologne , joachim meisner , who compared the mass murder of herod , hitler and stalin with abortion . he later expressed regret for his comparison .
abortion not prosecuted it 's been thirty years since germany 's constitutional court struck down a law that would have legalized abortion in the first 12 weeks .
to this day , article 218 in the german civil code makes abortion an offense - but it wo n't be prosecuted .
one of the cornerstones in germany when it comes to a possible pregnancy termination is counseling .

an ongoing debate in the late 1990 's led between pope john paul and the german catholic church led to a papal decree that ended counseling that would lead to an abortion .
until the end of 2000 , church organizations could counsel women who were having difficulties of any kind during the pregnancy .
if the woman did decide on termination , a church counselor would sign the mandatory paperwork declaring that the woman went through counseling .
as of january 1 , 2001 , the german catholic church suspended the signing of any forms that would accede to a woman 's desire for an abortion .
that would have to happen elsewhere .
many in the german catholic church had argued that the counseling tool was effective in combating abortion and now feel they have lost a tool to persuade a woman to carry out a pregnancy to term .
meanwhile , article 218 in the german civil code still makes abortion illegal .
yet the fact that the state does not prosecute is a compromise that silvia heyer , from the pro familia counseling group , can and must accept .

jackson said he had been " appalled and disappointed " when he first saw the photographs of the iraqi victims produced as evidence at the trial .
hoon said he was " profoundly disturbed " by the photographs , adding that he agreed with jackson " that the incidents depicted do not reflect typical behavior standards of the british army .
" we also agree that it is right to apologize on behalf of the army to the victims and the people of iraq , " hoon said , adding 22 soldiers in all , including those sentenced friday , were involved in abuse allegations .
" the army sets high standards and demand that they are met .
the recent court martial has demonstrated that those who fail to meet those standards are called to account , " hoon said . " the vast majority of service men and women do , however , perform to the very highest of standards .
their service in iraq has been outstanding and we are right to be proud of this , " the defense minister said .
the most senior of the trio sentenced here , corporal daniel kenyon , 33 , was given an 18-month prison sentence after being found guilty of three charges including failing to report the mistreatment of captured looters at an aid camp near basra in may 2003 .

other photographs showed naked iraqi men being forced to simulate sex .

the abuse came to light when another soldier submitted a film of the photographs for development at a shop in england .
a shop worker called the police after being shocked by the images .
the soldier who took the photographs , fusilier gary bartlam , was sentenced to 18 months in prison and discharged from the army in an earlier court martial .
in sentencing , judge advocate michael hunter said that an operation launched by the soldiers ' superior officers to detain the looters had gone " much further than was intended " .
but he said what happened " could have been avoided " .
" what you did was not done to discourage the looting , it was done to produce trophy photographs , " he said , adding that some of those involved in the abuse had not been brought to justice .
the images of the abuse prompted comparisons with the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib , which was depicted in a series of photographs taken by us guards .
the british press has criticized the fact that all the officers who planned or supervised the operation to round up the looters , known as operation ali baba , have since been promoted .

major dan taylor told the trial he had denied ordering that the iraqis be " beasted " , a term used by the british army to indicate making someone work until they are exhausted .
taylor admitted however he had thrown away notebooks containing information on the operation because he had moved to a smaller house . the image of the british army in iraq , the biggest contingent in the violence-wracked country after the americans , was set to suffer more damage .

jackson said he had been " appalled and disappointed " when he first saw the photographs of the iraqi victims produced as evidence at the trial .
hoon said he was " profoundly disturbed " by the photographs , adding that he agreed with jackson " that the incidents depicted do not reflect typical behavior standards of the british army .
" we also agree that it is right to apologize on behalf of the army to the victims and the people of iraq , " hoon said , adding 22 soldiers in all , including those sentenced friday , were involved in abuse allegations .
" the army sets high standards and demand that they are met .
the recent court martial has demonstrated that those who fail to meet those standards are called to account , " hoon said . " the vast majority of service men and women do , however , perform to the very highest of standards .
their service in iraq has been outstanding and we are right to be proud of this , " the defense minister said .
the most senior of the trio sentenced here , corporal daniel kenyon , 33 , was given an 18-month prison sentence after being found guilty of three charges including failing to report the mistreatment of captured looters at an aid camp near basra in may 2003 .

all three soldiers from the royal regiment of fusiliers were dishonorably discharged from the army by a panel of seven senior officers and a judge at the court martial in an army barracks in northern germany .
the abuse came to light when another soldier submitted a film of the photographs for development at a shop in england .
a shop worker called the police after being shocked by the images .
the soldier who took the photographs , fusilier gary bartlam , was sentenced to 18 months in prison and discharged from the army in an earlier court martial .
in sentencing , judge advocate michael hunter said that an operation launched by the soldiers ' superior officers to detain the looters had gone " much further than was intended " .
but he said what happened " could have been avoided " .
" what you did was not done to discourage the looting , it was done to produce trophy photographs , " he said , adding that some of those involved in the abuse had not been brought to justice .
the images of the abuse prompted comparisons with the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib , which was depicted in a series of photographs taken by us guards .

a bad pass , a missed penalty kick were typical of hamburg 's luck . some days a team can play excellent soccer and nevertheless walk off the field losers .
that was the case for thomas doll 's hamburger sv who dropped their match against their nearest bundesliga table competitors , hertha berlin , 4-1 .
and the comments after the game were indicative of just how obvious the players on both clubs felt .
the man who started the barrage for berlin , claudio reina , had nothing but praise for the north germans .
" hamburg played really well . "
and hertha goalkeeper christian fiedler was unimpressed with his team 's play .
" it was probably our worst game all season but we won . "
fourth minute goal set the tone just as the players were getting warmed up , hertha were the beneficiaries of a free-kick . with his new red colored hair , marcelinho got the kick past the wall .
claudio reina was on the spot and drove the ball into the goal .
a shock for hamburg but they did n't take it as such .
hamburg dominated play in the next ten minutes and had the better opportunities .
but as so frequently happens , a mistake at midfield led to a goal .
marcelinho won a ball in the center circle and found gilberto who slyly beat two defenders and as keeper pieckenhagen came out , put the ball between the goalie 's legs . after that the game was for all intents and purposes over .
hsv continued to push ahead .
one attack after the next failed and then the third goal was scored .
this time yildiray bastürk won a ball at midfield , stormed down the center of the field .
pieckenhagen could stop his shot from 16 meters out but it landed on marcelinho 's foot and he scored into the empty net .
hamburg fought on and just before the half were not granted a goal that looked to be 99 percent over the line .
bildunterschrift : right through the wickets - gilberto 's -lrb- left -rrb- shot rolls through the legs of hamburg keeper pieckenhagen second half chances given away thomas doll 's team did not give up in the second half and after 17 minutes , it looked like their efforts would pay off .
bastürk stopped a sure goal with his hand for which he saw red .
sergej barbarez then misfired on the ensuing penalty kick and hit the post .
that was symptomatic of their day .
barbarez however would make up by scoring a goal in the 78th minute but it would n't be enough .
in fact , hamburg would make another error in their own end , which led to gilberto 's second goal of the match .
hertha underscores european aspirations coming into this match , both teams were looking to move into the top five in the standings .
hertha now finds themselves of being at least in fifth-place and should leverkusen and stuttgart draw on sunday , they will be in fourth .
hamburg , up till today the best team in the second leg , have to lick their wounds and get ready for another big match next week , against leverkusen .
they played well but as barbarez said after the game , they lacked the luck they had in last week 's 2-1 victory against kaiserslautern . dw staff -lrb- jdk -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hi-tech ball primed for world cup debut a new soccer ball designed to eradicate controversial goal-line decisions is expected to be approved by a law making body in the next step toward its inclusion in the 2006 world cup in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.02.2005 fischer goes on offensive in visa affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer 's speech was well received by greens delegates german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted saturday he made mistakes in an affair involving the misuse of visas by criminal human traffickers from eastern europe , but he remained defiant amid calls to resign . " i 've made mistakes , " fischer told a cologne meeting of his greens party , the junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition .
" but that has nothing to do with the party , " he added .
fischer is the greens ' most high-profile figure . fischer , whose poll ratings have dived over the controversy , acknowledged that under his foreign ministry stewardship since 1998 two decisions had been made that were to damaging visa policy .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . germany 's conservative opposition claims lack of vigilance by fischer meant " hundreds of thousands " of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed , thereby allegedly fostering organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , said on saturday fischer had failed to uphold the duties of his office and therefore had to go .
" if he had an ounce of self-respect left he 'd know what he has to do , " merkel said .
" plenty of ministers have resigned over less . " but fischer attacked the conservatives for opportunistically labeling all eastern europeans as lawbreakers .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they can demand my resignation , but they must stop stigmatizing an entire people as criminals just for an election campaign ! " fischer 's speech to the greens in north rhine-westphalia was keenly awaited by many hoping to gauge his strategy before he testifies in the coming weeks before a parliamentary investigation into the affair .
his feisty reply energized both those in his party and members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . fischer has the full backing of schröder , who this weekend again dismissed demands by the opposition for his resignation .
in an interview with the frankfurt allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schröder made clear fischer was going nowhere : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister ! " less popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't you like me anymore ?
but fischer lost his standing as germany 's most popular politician for the first time in three years in a key poll friday amid the ongoing scandal .
the " politbarometer " published by public broadcaster zdf showed that the affair over the abuse of tourist was taking a political toll . after more than three years leading the ranks of germany 's " top 10 most important political officials " , fischer slipped to second place with a rating of 0.8 , down by half from the 1.6 he tallied last month .
five would the highest score in a scale that assesses an official 's public profile , image and likability . he was bested by lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the conservative opposition christian democrats , who has been considered a dark-horse candidate for the chancellery in next year 's general election .
wulff benefited from fischer 's slide , but also from a poll quirk that eliminates the responses of people who said they did not know the politician well enough to judge .
half the respondents gave this response for wulff . the visa scandal comes at an inopportune time for schröder 's government , with his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- unable to break a marathon losing streak in a series of state elections .
the spd suffered a surprise loss in schleswig-holstein last sunday and will face a crucial test in a poll in the most populous state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 . until then , it will be scrambling to control the political damage from the visa affair . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.02.2005 fischer goes on offensive in visa affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer 's speech was well received by greens delegates german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted saturday he made mistakes in an affair involving the misuse of visas by criminal human traffickers from eastern europe , but he remained defiant amid calls to resign . " i 've made mistakes , " fischer told a cologne meeting of his greens party , the junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition .
" but that has nothing to do with the party , " he added .
fischer is the greens ' most high-profile figure . fischer , whose poll ratings have dived over the controversy , acknowledged that under his foreign ministry stewardship since 1998 two decisions had been made that were to damaging visa policy .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . germany 's conservative opposition claims lack of vigilance by fischer meant " hundreds of thousands " of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed , thereby allegedly fostering organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , said on saturday fischer had failed to uphold the duties of his office and therefore had to go .
" if he had an ounce of self-respect left he 'd know what he has to do , " merkel said .
" plenty of ministers have resigned over less . " but fischer attacked the conservatives for opportunistically labeling all eastern europeans as lawbreakers .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they can demand my resignation , but they must stop stigmatizing an entire people as criminals just for an election campaign ! " fischer 's speech to the greens in north rhine-westphalia was keenly awaited by many hoping to gauge his strategy before he testifies in the coming weeks before a parliamentary investigation into the affair .
his feisty reply energized both those in his party and members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . fischer has the full backing of schröder , who this weekend again dismissed demands by the opposition for his resignation .
in an interview with the frankfurt allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schröder made clear fischer was going nowhere : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister ! " less popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't you like me anymore ?
but fischer lost his standing as germany 's most popular politician for the first time in three years in a key poll friday amid the ongoing scandal .
the " politbarometer " published by public broadcaster zdf showed that the affair over the abuse of tourist was taking a political toll . after more than three years leading the ranks of germany 's " top 10 most important political officials " , fischer slipped to second place with a rating of 0.8 , down by half from the 1.6 he tallied last month .
five would the highest score in a scale that assesses an official 's public profile , image and likability . he was bested by lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the conservative opposition christian democrats , who has been considered a dark-horse candidate for the chancellery in next year 's general election .
wulff benefited from fischer 's slide , but also from a poll quirk that eliminates the responses of people who said they did not know the politician well enough to judge .
half the respondents gave this response for wulff . the visa scandal comes at an inopportune time for schröder 's government , with his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- unable to break a marathon losing streak in a series of state elections .
the spd suffered a surprise loss in schleswig-holstein last sunday and will face a crucial test in a poll in the most populous state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 . until then , it will be scrambling to control the political damage from the visa affair . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?
these are tough times for joschka fischer .

a bad pass , a missed penalty kick were typical of hamburg 's luck . some days a team can play excellent soccer and nevertheless walk off the field losers .
that was the case for thomas doll 's hamburger sv who dropped their match against their nearest bundesliga table competitors , hertha berlin , 4-1 .
and the comments after the game were indicative of just how obvious the players on both clubs felt .
the man who started the barrage for berlin , claudio reina , had nothing but praise for the north germans .
" hamburg played really well . "
and hertha goalkeeper christian fiedler was unimpressed with his team 's play .
" it was probably our worst game all season but we won . "
fourth minute goal set the tone just as the players were getting warmed up , hertha were the beneficiaries of a free-kick . with his new red colored hair , marcelinho got the kick past the wall .
claudio reina was on the spot and drove the ball into the goal .
a shock for hamburg but they did n't take it as such .
hamburg dominated play in the next ten minutes and had the better opportunities .
but as so frequently happens , a mistake at midfield led to a goal .
marcelinho won a ball in the center circle and found gilberto who slyly beat two defenders and as keeper pieckenhagen came out , put the ball between the goalie 's legs . after that the game was for all intents and purposes over .
hsv continued to push ahead .
one attack after the next failed and then the third goal was scored .
this time yildiray bastürk won a ball at midfield , stormed down the center of the field .
pieckenhagen could stop his shot from 16 meters out but it landed on marcelinho 's foot and he scored into the empty net .
hamburg fought on and just before the half were not granted a goal that looked to be 99 percent over the line .
bildunterschrift : right through the wickets - gilberto 's -lrb- left -rrb- shot rolls through the legs of hamburg keeper pieckenhagen second half chances given away thomas doll 's team did not give up in the second half and after 17 minutes , it looked like their efforts would pay off .
bastürk stopped a sure goal with his hand for which he saw red .
sergej barbarez then misfired on the ensuing penalty kick and hit the post .
that was symptomatic of their day .
barbarez however would make up by scoring a goal in the 78th minute but it would n't be enough .
in fact , hamburg would make another error in their own end , which led to gilberto 's second goal of the match .
hertha underscores european aspirations coming into this match , both teams were looking to move into the top five in the standings .
hertha now finds themselves of being at least in fifth-place and should leverkusen and stuttgart draw on sunday , they will be in fourth .
hamburg , up till today the best team in the second leg , have to lick their wounds and get ready for another big match next week , against leverkusen .

jackson said he had been " appalled and disappointed " when he first saw the photographs of the iraqi victims produced as evidence at the trial .
hoon said he was " profoundly disturbed " by the photographs , adding that he agreed with jackson " that the incidents depicted do not reflect typical behavior standards of the british army .
" we also agree that it is right to apologize on behalf of the army to the victims and the people of iraq , " hoon said , adding 22 soldiers in all , including those sentenced friday , were involved in abuse allegations .
" the army sets high standards and demand that they are met .
the recent court martial has demonstrated that those who fail to meet those standards are called to account , " hoon said . " the vast majority of service men and women do , however , perform to the very highest of standards .
their service in iraq has been outstanding and we are right to be proud of this , " the defense minister said .
the most senior of the trio sentenced here , corporal daniel kenyon , 33 , was given an 18-month prison sentence after being found guilty of three charges including failing to report the mistreatment of captured looters at an aid camp near basra in may 2003 .
lance corporal mark cooley , 25 , was sentenced to two years in jail after being found guilty of two charges including driving a forklift truck with a bound iraqi suspended from the prongs .
a series of photos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance corporal larkin standing on an iraqi detainee and corporal kenyon taking a photograph .
a photograph of the helpless iraqi dangling from the forklift was among a series of photos taken by soldiers at the aid camp known as camp bread basket .
other photographs showed naked iraqi men being forced to simulate sex .
the third defendant , lance corporal darren larkin , 30 , was sentenced to 140 days , just under five months , in jail after he pleaded guilty to assault .
he had been pictured standing on an iraqi .
all three soldiers from the royal regiment of fusiliers were dishonorably discharged from the army by a panel of seven senior officers and a judge at the court martial in an army barracks in northern germany .
the abuse came to light when another soldier submitted a film of the photographs for development at a shop in england .
a shop worker called the police after being shocked by the images .
the soldier who took the photographs , fusilier gary bartlam , was sentenced to 18 months in prison and discharged from the army in an earlier court martial .
in sentencing , judge advocate michael hunter said that an operation launched by the soldiers ' superior officers to detain the looters had gone " much further than was intended " .
but he said what happened " could have been avoided " .
" what you did was not done to discourage the looting , it was done to produce trophy photographs , " he said , adding that some of those involved in the abuse had not been brought to justice .
the images of the abuse prompted comparisons with the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib , which was depicted in a series of photographs taken by us guards .
the british press has criticized the fact that all the officers who planned or supervised the operation to round up the looters , known as operation ali baba , have since been promoted .
prosecution lawyers told the court martial that the order to work the looters " hard " contravened the geneva convention .

major dan taylor told the trial he had denied ordering that the iraqis be " beasted " , a term used by the british army to indicate making someone work until they are exhausted .
taylor admitted however he had thrown away notebooks containing information on the operation because he had moved to a smaller house . the image of the british army in iraq , the biggest contingent in the violence-wracked country after the americans , was set to suffer more damage .
seven soldiers from the 3rd parachute regiment have already been charged with murder and violent disorder , and faced courts martial over the death of an iraqi civilian in southern iraq around the time of the incidents examined in the osnabrueck trial .

jackson said he had been " appalled and disappointed " when he first saw the photographs of the iraqi victims produced as evidence at the trial .
hoon said he was " profoundly disturbed " by the photographs , adding that he agreed with jackson " that the incidents depicted do not reflect typical behavior standards of the british army .
" we also agree that it is right to apologize on behalf of the army to the victims and the people of iraq , " hoon said , adding 22 soldiers in all , including those sentenced friday , were involved in abuse allegations .
" the army sets high standards and demand that they are met .
the recent court martial has demonstrated that those who fail to meet those standards are called to account , " hoon said . " the vast majority of service men and women do , however , perform to the very highest of standards .
their service in iraq has been outstanding and we are right to be proud of this , " the defense minister said .
the most senior of the trio sentenced here , corporal daniel kenyon , 33 , was given an 18-month prison sentence after being found guilty of three charges including failing to report the mistreatment of captured looters at an aid camp near basra in may 2003 .
lance corporal mark cooley , 25 , was sentenced to two years in jail after being found guilty of two charges including driving a forklift truck with a bound iraqi suspended from the prongs .
a series of photos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lance corporal larkin standing on an iraqi detainee and corporal kenyon taking a photograph .
a photograph of the helpless iraqi dangling from the forklift was among a series of photos taken by soldiers at the aid camp known as camp bread basket .
other photographs showed naked iraqi men being forced to simulate sex .
the third defendant , lance corporal darren larkin , 30 , was sentenced to 140 days , just under five months , in jail after he pleaded guilty to assault .
he had been pictured standing on an iraqi .
all three soldiers from the royal regiment of fusiliers were dishonorably discharged from the army by a panel of seven senior officers and a judge at the court martial in an army barracks in northern germany .
the abuse came to light when another soldier submitted a film of the photographs for development at a shop in england .
a shop worker called the police after being shocked by the images .
the soldier who took the photographs , fusilier gary bartlam , was sentenced to 18 months in prison and discharged from the army in an earlier court martial .
in sentencing , judge advocate michael hunter said that an operation launched by the soldiers ' superior officers to detain the looters had gone " much further than was intended " .
but he said what happened " could have been avoided " .
" what you did was not done to discourage the looting , it was done to produce trophy photographs , " he said , adding that some of those involved in the abuse had not been brought to justice .
the images of the abuse prompted comparisons with the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib , which was depicted in a series of photographs taken by us guards .
the british press has criticized the fact that all the officers who planned or supervised the operation to round up the looters , known as operation ali baba , have since been promoted .

major dan taylor told the trial he had denied ordering that the iraqis be " beasted " , a term used by the british army to indicate making someone work until they are exhausted .

seven soldiers from the 3rd parachute regiment have already been charged with murder and violent disorder , and faced courts martial over the death of an iraqi civilian in southern iraq around the time of the incidents examined in the osnabrueck trial .

all three soldiers from the royal regiment of fusiliers were dishonorably discharged from the army by a panel of seven senior officers and a judge at the court martial in an army barracks in northern germany .
the abuse came to light when another soldier submitted a film of the photographs for development at a shop in england .
a shop worker called the police after being shocked by the images .
the soldier who took the photographs , fusilier gary bartlam , was sentenced to 18 months in prison and discharged from the army in an earlier court martial .
in sentencing , judge advocate michael hunter said that an operation launched by the soldiers ' superior officers to detain the looters had gone " much further than was intended " .
but he said what happened " could have been avoided " .
" what you did was not done to discourage the looting , it was done to produce trophy photographs , " he said , adding that some of those involved in the abuse had not been brought to justice .
the images of the abuse prompted comparisons with the mistreatment of prisoners at abu ghraib , which was depicted in a series of photographs taken by us guards .
the british press has criticized the fact that all the officers who planned or supervised the operation to round up the looters , known as operation ali baba , have since been promoted .
prosecution lawyers told the court martial that the order to work the looters " hard " contravened the geneva convention .
" beasting " ordered ?
major dan taylor told the trial he had denied ordering that the iraqis be " beasted " , a term used by the british army to indicate making someone work until they are exhausted .
taylor admitted however he had thrown away notebooks containing information on the operation because he had moved to a smaller house . the image of the british army in iraq , the biggest contingent in the violence-wracked country after the americans , was set to suffer more damage .
seven soldiers from the 3rd parachute regiment have already been charged with murder and violent disorder , and faced courts martial over the death of an iraqi civilian in southern iraq around the time of the incidents examined in the osnabrueck trial .
the times newspaper said on thursday that as many as 11 more soldiers could face court martial over a beating in which an iraqi civilian died , and other instances of abuse . afp -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de torture or only mistreatment ?

" i 've made mistakes , " fischer told a cologne meeting of his greens party , the junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition .
" but that has nothing to do with the party , " he added .
fischer is the greens ' most high-profile figure . fischer , whose poll ratings have dived over the controversy , acknowledged that under his foreign ministry stewardship since 1998 two decisions had been made that were to damaging visa policy .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . germany 's conservative opposition claims lack of vigilance by fischer meant " hundreds of thousands " of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed , thereby allegedly fostering organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , said on saturday fischer had failed to uphold the duties of his office and therefore had to go .
" if he had an ounce of self-respect left he 'd know what he has to do , " merkel said .
" plenty of ministers have resigned over less . " but fischer attacked the conservatives for opportunistically labeling all eastern europeans as lawbreakers .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they can demand my resignation , but they must stop stigmatizing an entire people as criminals just for an election campaign ! " fischer 's speech to the greens in north rhine-westphalia was keenly awaited by many hoping to gauge his strategy before he testifies in the coming weeks before a parliamentary investigation into the affair .
his feisty reply energized both those in his party and members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . fischer has the full backing of schröder , who this weekend again dismissed demands by the opposition for his resignation .
in an interview with the frankfurt allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schröder made clear fischer was going nowhere : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister ! " less popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't you like me anymore ?
but fischer lost his standing as germany 's most popular politician for the first time in three years in a key poll friday amid the ongoing scandal .
the " politbarometer " published by public broadcaster zdf showed that the affair over the abuse of tourist was taking a political toll . after more than three years leading the ranks of germany 's " top 10 most important political officials " , fischer slipped to second place with a rating of 0.8 , down by half from the 1.6 he tallied last month .
five would the highest score in a scale that assesses an official 's public profile , image and likability . he was bested by lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the conservative opposition christian democrats , who has been considered a dark-horse candidate for the chancellery in next year 's general election .
wulff benefited from fischer 's slide , but also from a poll quirk that eliminates the responses of people who said they did not know the politician well enough to judge .
half the respondents gave this response for wulff . the visa scandal comes at an inopportune time for schröder 's government , with his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- unable to break a marathon losing streak in a series of state elections .
the spd suffered a surprise loss in schleswig-holstein last sunday and will face a crucial test in a poll in the most populous state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 . until then , it will be scrambling to control the political damage from the visa affair . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.02.2005 fischer goes on offensive in visa affair großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fischer 's speech was well received by greens delegates german foreign minister joschka fischer admitted saturday he made mistakes in an affair involving the misuse of visas by criminal human traffickers from eastern europe , but he remained defiant amid calls to resign . " i 've made mistakes , " fischer told a cologne meeting of his greens party , the junior members of chancellor gerhard schröder 's center-left coalition .
" but that has nothing to do with the party , " he added .
fischer is the greens ' most high-profile figure . fischer , whose poll ratings have dived over the controversy , acknowledged that under his foreign ministry stewardship since 1998 two decisions had been made that were to damaging visa policy .
" i did not react with sufficient speed or firmness , or fully enough as the responsible minister , " he said . germany 's conservative opposition claims lack of vigilance by fischer meant " hundreds of thousands " of clandestine immigrants from the former soviet bloc - ukraine in particular - were able to enter germany between 2000 and 2003 after tourist visa criteria were relaxed , thereby allegedly fostering organized crime , a submerged economy and prostitution . angela merkel , head of the conservative christian democrats , said on saturday fischer had failed to uphold the duties of his office and therefore had to go .
" if he had an ounce of self-respect left he 'd know what he has to do , " merkel said .
" plenty of ministers have resigned over less . " but fischer attacked the conservatives for opportunistically labeling all eastern europeans as lawbreakers .
" as far as i 'm concerned , they can demand my resignation , but they must stop stigmatizing an entire people as criminals just for an election campaign ! " fischer 's speech to the greens in north rhine-westphalia was keenly awaited by many hoping to gauge his strategy before he testifies in the coming weeks before a parliamentary investigation into the affair .
his feisty reply energized both those in his party and members of schröder 's social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- . fischer has the full backing of schröder , who this weekend again dismissed demands by the opposition for his resignation .
in an interview with the frankfurt allgemeine sonntagszeitung newspaper , schröder made clear fischer was going nowhere : " the foreign minister will remain the foreign minister ! " less popular bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do n't you like me anymore ?
but fischer lost his standing as germany 's most popular politician for the first time in three years in a key poll friday amid the ongoing scandal .
the " politbarometer " published by public broadcaster zdf showed that the affair over the abuse of tourist was taking a political toll . after more than three years leading the ranks of germany 's " top 10 most important political officials " , fischer slipped to second place with a rating of 0.8 , down by half from the 1.6 he tallied last month .
five would the highest score in a scale that assesses an official 's public profile , image and likability . he was bested by lower saxony state premier christian wulff of the conservative opposition christian democrats , who has been considered a dark-horse candidate for the chancellery in next year 's general election .
wulff benefited from fischer 's slide , but also from a poll quirk that eliminates the responses of people who said they did not know the politician well enough to judge .
half the respondents gave this response for wulff . the visa scandal comes at an inopportune time for schröder 's government , with his social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- unable to break a marathon losing streak in a series of state elections .
the spd suffered a surprise loss in schleswig-holstein last sunday and will face a crucial test in a poll in the most populous state of north rhine-westphalia on may 22 . until then , it will be scrambling to control the political damage from the visa affair . dw staff -lrb- mry -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when will fischer take the hot seat ?

the royal society for the protection of birds is monitoring the number of dead birds on the uk 's coastline in order to assess the health of the population .
the survey follows a disastrous breeding season last year , in which thousands of birds starved to death .
without action , time is running out for the birds , the charity warns .
hundreds of volunteers will check 1,560 miles of coastline , starting in the north of england on saturday , looking for the bodies of birds washed ashore .
the rspb will then try to assess how the birds died .
starving to death in 2004 , hundreds of fulmars - a gull-like seabird - were washed up on north sea beaches after dying of starvation .
the breeding season saw hatchings fail and chicks starving to death .
a shortage of sand eels , an important part of many seabirds ' diet , was blamed for the crisis .
but the rspb said the growth of industrial fishing , where factory ships harvest millions of tonnes of small shoaling fish to become feed for fish farms and other livestock , will worsen an already difficult situation .
the charity welcomed government proposals , announced last month , aimed at regulating fishing .
but the organisation 's north of england conservation manager , nick mason , said action was needed before it was too late .
" we welcome the government 's commitment for new legislation to help safeguard our seas , but this needs to be implemented rapidly and the content needs to be robust enough to tackle some major issues .
" if the government does not fulfil its promise quickly , sea life will decline , fishermen will have little left to catch and conservationists and industry will battle over proposals for any form of development . "

the royal society for the protection of birds is monitoring the number of dead birds on the uk 's coastline in order to assess the health of the population .
the survey follows a disastrous breeding season last year , in which thousands of birds starved to death .
without action , time is running out for the birds , the charity warns .
hundreds of volunteers will check 1,560 miles of coastline , starting in the north of england on saturday , looking for the bodies of birds washed ashore .
the rspb will then try to assess how the birds died .
starving to death in 2004 , hundreds of fulmars - a gull-like seabird - were washed up on north sea beaches after dying of starvation .
the breeding season saw hatchings fail and chicks starving to death .
a shortage of sand eels , an important part of many seabirds ' diet , was blamed for the crisis .
but the rspb said the growth of industrial fishing , where factory ships harvest millions of tonnes of small shoaling fish to become feed for fish farms and other livestock , will worsen an already difficult situation .
the charity welcomed government proposals , announced last month , aimed at regulating fishing .
but the organisation 's north of england conservation manager , nick mason , said action was needed before it was too late .
" we welcome the government 's commitment for new legislation to help safeguard our seas , but this needs to be implemented rapidly and the content needs to be robust enough to tackle some major issues .
" if the government does not fulfil its promise quickly , sea life will decline , fishermen will have little left to catch and conservationists and industry will battle over proposals for any form of development . "

a prosecutor said ljube boskovski ordered the killings months after the 9/11 attacks to earn us recognition as a partner in the " war on terror " .
macedonian officials later said the six pakistanis and one indian had been killed in a " staged " encounter .
mr boskovski , who denies the charge , has been living in croatia since 2004 .
croatian authorities arrested him late last year , acting on a warrant issued by macedonia , and will try him there .
a prosecutor in northwestern croatia said mr boskovski has been charged with " having orchestrated and carried out the murder of seven economic immigrants in order to prove to the us that macedonia was participating in the international war on terrorism " .
murder charges mr boskovski , who holds dual croatian and macedonian citizenship , fled from macedonia after being accused of involvement in the killings .
he says he is not guilty of the charge and has evidence that proves the slain men were al-qaeda operatives , planning an attack on western targets in macedonia , in concert with albanian militants .
four men , including police officers and a businessman , have been put on trial in macedonia on charges of luring the seven immigrants from bulgaria before killing them .
all the defendants deny the charges .
remembered in macedonia as a hardline interior minister , mr boskovski also commanded his own elite paramilitary police unit in 2001 , at a time of escalating unrest between the security forces and ethnic albanian guerrillas .
the unit was disbanded in 2003 , more than a year after a western-brokered peace deal restored calm to the region .

the uk film council has awarded a contract worth £ 11.5m to arts alliance digital cinema -lrb- aadc -rrb- , who will set up the network of up to 250 screens .
aadc will oversee the selection of cinemas across the uk which will use the digital equipment .
high definition projectors and computer servers will be installed to show mainly british and specialist films .
most cinemas currently have mechanical projectors but the new network will see up to 250 screens in up to 150 cinemas fitted with digital projectors capable of displaying high definition images .
the new network will double the world 's total of digital screens .
cinemas will be given the film on a portable hard drive and they will then copy the content to a computer server .
visually lossless each film is about 100 gigabytes and has been compressed from an original one terabyte-size file .
fiona deans , associate director of aadc , said the compression was visually lossless so no picture degradation will occur .
with digital prints , every cinema will have its own copy fionea deans , aadc the film will all be encrypted to prevent piracy and each cinema will have an individual key which will unlock the movie .
" people will see the picture quality is a bit clearer with no scratches .
" the picture will look exactly the same as when the print was first made - there is no degradation in quality over time . "
key benefit the key benefit of the digital network will be an increase in the distribution and screening of british films , documentaries and foreign language films .
is this the end for traditional film prints ?
" access to specialised film is currently restricted across the uk , " said pete buckingham , head of distribution and exhibition at the uk film council .
" although a genuine variety of films is available in central london and a few other metropolitan areas , the choice for many outside these areas remains limited , and the digital screen network will improve access for audiences across the uk , " digital prints cost less than a traditional 35mm print - giving distributors more flexibility in how they screen films , said ms deans .
" it can cost up to £ 1,500 to make a copy of a print for specialist films .
" in the digital world you can make prints for considerably less than that .
" distributors can then send out prints to more cinemas and prints can stay in cinemas for much longer . "
the uk digital network will be the first to employ 2k projectors - which are capable of showing films at resolutions of 2048 * 1080 pixels .
a separate competitive process to determine which cinemas will receive the digital screening technology will conclude in may .
the sheer cost of traditional prints means that some cinemas need to show them twice a day in order to recoup costs .
" some films need word of mouth and time to build momentum - they do n't need to be shown twice a day , " explained ms deans .
" a cinema will often book a 35mm print in for two weeks - even if the film is a roaring success they can not hold on to the print because it will have to go to another cinema .
" with digital prints , every cinema will have its own copy . "
