" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .

we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?

the problem is that it must be clear to the germans - as to all the others , too - that , 60 years after the war 's end , there should no longer be a purely national approach , especially in emotional terms .

for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

" bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .

german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .
" it has also been taken over by other countries , but it 's getting a bit long in the tooth .
we have to be more flexible and offer greater incentives to companies to employ more young people . " in other words , apprentices are paid too much in relation to the general economic development in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking the job postings hellmann praised steps the german government has taken to boost people 's incentives to work .
the controversial welfare reforms known as hartz iv came into force in january , cutting benefits for those unwilling to work .
the reforms are also intended to speed up job-hunting for others . " hartz iv was definitely a step in the right direction , but now we need jobs that will remain competitive in the long term , " hellmann said .
" we have to improve the basic conditions so that these jobs can be created .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .
do you also see a trend towards german navel-gazing ? there is german navel-gazing , that 's true - but there are also many counterbalances .
one merely needs to open one 's eyes .
that 's not the problem .
the problem is that it must be clear to the germans - as to all the others , too - that , 60 years after the war 's end , there should no longer be a purely national approach , especially in emotional terms .
one may express and describe it , but at the same time one should make clear there 's always another perspective . oliver samson interviewed christina weiss -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .
do you also see a trend towards german navel-gazing ? there is german navel-gazing , that 's true - but there are also many counterbalances .
one merely needs to open one 's eyes .
that 's not the problem .
the problem is that it must be clear to the germans - as to all the others , too - that , 60 years after the war 's end , there should no longer be a purely national approach , especially in emotional terms .
one may express and describe it , but at the same time one should make clear there 's always another perspective . oliver samson interviewed christina weiss -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.05.2005 study raises flag on youth unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study says germany needs to improve prospects for young people the german economy has chalked up few successes over the past six months , according to a new study by the bertelsmann foundation .
the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .

the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .
do you also see a trend towards german navel-gazing ? there is german navel-gazing , that 's true - but there are also many counterbalances .
one merely needs to open one 's eyes .
that 's not the problem .
the problem is that it must be clear to the germans - as to all the others , too - that , 60 years after the war 's end , there should no longer be a purely national approach , especially in emotional terms .

i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "

in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .

we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .

german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?

what did we do ?

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

" bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 07.05.2005 study raises flag on youth unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the study says germany needs to improve prospects for young people the german economy has chalked up few successes over the past six months , according to a new study by the bertelsmann foundation .
the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .
" it has also been taken over by other countries , but it 's getting a bit long in the tooth .
we have to be more flexible and offer greater incentives to companies to employ more young people . " in other words , apprentices are paid too much in relation to the general economic development in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking the job postings hellmann praised steps the german government has taken to boost people 's incentives to work .
the controversial welfare reforms known as hartz iv came into force in january , cutting benefits for those unwilling to work .

the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .
" it has also been taken over by other countries , but it 's getting a bit long in the tooth .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .
do you also see a trend towards german navel-gazing ? there is german navel-gazing , that 's true - but there are also many counterbalances .
one merely needs to open one 's eyes .
that 's not the problem .
the problem is that it must be clear to the germans - as to all the others , too - that , 60 years after the war 's end , there should no longer be a purely national approach , especially in emotional terms .

" as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.05.2005 bush ruffles russian feathers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush with latvian president vike-freiberga in riga the occupation by the soviet union of the baltic states at the end of world war ii was " one of the greatest wrongs in history , " us president bush said in a speech saturday in the latvian capital . " as we mark a victory of six decades ago , we are mindful of a paradox .
for much of germany , defeat led to freedom .
for much of eastern and central europe , victory brought the iron rule of another empire , " bush said in the 14th-century small guild building in riga 's old town . " v-e day marked the end of fascism , but not the end of oppression .
the agreement at yalta followed in the unjust tradition of munich and the molotov-ribbentrop pact , " he said .
the yalta pact , which was signed by soviet strongman joseph stalin , britain 's winston churchill and us wartime president franklin d. roosevelt in the waning months of the war , redrew the map of post-war europe , giving much of eastern and central europe to moscow . " once again , when powerful governments negotiated , the freedom of small nations was somehow expendable , " bush said .
" the captivity of millions in central and eastern europe will be remembered as one of the greatest wrongs of history . " bush has acknowledged several times during his one-day stay in latvia that the end of the war may have brought peace to western europe , but at the same time it meant communist occupation of the baltic states . " i love the fact that you 're a free nation " the us president is on a four-day visit of europe to participate in events commemorating the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war and to highlight the us role in defeating nazi germany .
on may 8 , he will be in the netherlands for a speech at the military cemetery at margraten , where more than 8,000 us soldiers , killed during the allied assault on germany , are buried . from there he will head to moscow on may 9 for celebrations organized by russia . earlier , after holding talks with latvian president vera vike-freiberga at the 700-year-old riga castle , bush laid a wreath at latvia 's freedom monument in the centre of the capital , unveiled in 1935 during latvia 's brief period of independence between the world wars and seen as a symbol of statehood and independence . after paying a silent tribute to those who have fallen for an independent latvia , the us leader signed autographs and chatted with the crowd of more than 100 who had gathered at the 42-metre -lrb- 140-foot -rrb- high statue , crowned with three stars of liberty . bush went into closed-door summit-level talks with the latvian leader , estonia 's president arnold ruutel and lithuania 's valdas adamkus in the early afternoon . earlier , at riga castle , bush said after being bestowed the three star order , latvia 's highest distinction : " i am honoured to be with a president that speaks so clearly for the need for people to be free , in recognition that free people will live at peace .
i admire your country 's courage .
i love the fact that you 're a free nation and willing to speak out so clearly for freedom , " bush said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vaira vike-freiberga vike-freiberga has called bush 's choice to make the baltics the first stop on his lightning tour of europe a powerful sign that the us shares a common vision of post-world war ii history with the baltic states . " by coming to latvia , us president george bush has underscored the double meaning of the 60th anniversary of the end of the second world war ... the dual meaning of the date , " she said . " there was no occupation " bush 's remarks are expected to irk moscow before lavish celebrations on monday of the 1945 victory over the nazis . soviet authority was first established in the baltics in 1940 , following a secret pact between stalin and nazi germany .
the three republics were then held by german forces between june 1941 and 1945 , when the victorious red army returned , placing the region under moscow 's control until the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 . the baltic states want moscow to recognize their annexation as illegal - a request that has been turned down by russia . on thursday , the kremlin 's european affairs chief , sergei yastrzhembsky , struck a strident note . " there was no occupation , " he told reporters .
" there were agreements at the time with the legitimately elected authorities in the baltic countries . " the defiant statement has upped the ante in a growing dispute with the european union , including the three tiny baltic republics - estonia , latvia , lithuania - and the united states , which want moscow to recognize that the red army occupied swathes of eastern europe in the wake of the retreating nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : municipal workers create huge signs for monday 's celebrations marking the 60th anniversary of the allies ' world war ii victory in europe .
far from being a dry historical debate , the row about the nature of soviet rule in the baltics is spiraling into a full-scale diplomatic spat ahead of next monday 's lavish victory day celebrations .
russian president vladimir putin wants the event , in which some 60 world leaders will watch a red square military parade , to showcase russia 's historic contribution to defeating nazi germany and to boost russia 's international standing . bush understands baltic countries but the presidents of lithuania and estonia , valdas adamkus and arnold rüütel , refused to come , while latvia 's president vaira vike-freiberga says she will use the occasion to remind the world " that at the end of second world war half of europe was not liberated . " on thursday , bush said the united states understands estonia 's decision to stay away from celebrations marking the end of world war ii in moscow because of the country 's five decades under repressive soviet rule . " i can understand the decision of your president , and that of the president of lithuania and the president of latvia , " bush said in the interview on estonian television when asked to comment after the leaders of estonia and lithuania declined moscow 's invitation to the ve-day ceremonies on monday . " it 's a difficult decision and it reflects difficult times , " bush added .
" i honour these decisions . " bush said many baltic families in america had seen their countries lose independence at the end of world war ii . " on the one hand , our country helped defeat fascism , but on the other hand , they saw their homeland taken over by repressive ideology , " bush said . in a letter to estonian president arnold rüütel , bush said his trip to europe , due to start friday , " will mark the sacrifice of america and many other nations in defeating nazism . " european commission vice-president günter verheugen said earlier this week that moscow 's relations with brussels would depend on russia admitting the illegality of soviet rule in the baltics . bush 's signal to moscow since gaining independence in 1991 , the three baltic nations have broken out of the sphere of russian influence and joined the north atlantic treaty organization and the european union . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the stock exchange in riga for bush 's administration , they represent the new post-soviet european architecture .
bush 's visit to latvia on saturday , a first by a us president since 1994 , is thus seen as a strong signal to moscow to respect the independence of the three former soviet republics and their inclusion in the west 's sphere of influence . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de baltics shun moscow wwii celebrations the presidents of estonia and lithuania will not attend celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii in moscow because their countries fell under the soviet yoke for nearly five decades after the war .

state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .
do you also see a trend towards german navel-gazing ? there is german navel-gazing , that 's true - but there are also many counterbalances .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.05.2005 " we must jointly talk about our history " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss : " there 's always another perspective " as ceremonies in honor of the 60th anniversary of the end of world war ii near their climax , dw-world spoke to germany 's culture secretary about german tributes and the necessity of a pan-european perspective . dw-world : the head of the german-russian museum in his opening speech jokingly complained that in an interview recently you failed to mention the museum as a prominent place commemorating 1945 .
now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .

the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .
" it has also been taken over by other countries , but it 's getting a bit long in the tooth .
we have to be more flexible and offer greater incentives to companies to employ more young people . " in other words , apprentices are paid too much in relation to the general economic development in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking the job postings hellmann praised steps the german government has taken to boost people 's incentives to work .
the controversial welfare reforms known as hartz iv came into force in january , cutting benefits for those unwilling to work .
the reforms are also intended to speed up job-hunting for others . " hartz iv was definitely a step in the right direction , but now we need jobs that will remain competitive in the long term , " hellmann said .
" we have to improve the basic conditions so that these jobs can be created .

the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .
" it has also been taken over by other countries , but it 's getting a bit long in the tooth .
we have to be more flexible and offer greater incentives to companies to employ more young people . " in other words , apprentices are paid too much in relation to the general economic development in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking the job postings hellmann praised steps the german government has taken to boost people 's incentives to work .
the controversial welfare reforms known as hartz iv came into force in january , cutting benefits for those unwilling to work .
the reforms are also intended to speed up job-hunting for others . " hartz iv was definitely a step in the right direction , but now we need jobs that will remain competitive in the long term , " hellmann said .
" we have to improve the basic conditions so that these jobs can be created .

even those over 45 who find themselves jobless often have to accept that their working lives have come to an end .
-lrb- march 9 , 2005 -rrb- foreigners to boost german job training some one million jobs in germany are with companies that are not german-owned .
but these firms are less likely to offer much needed training positions for students - an integral part of germany 's education system .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .
do you also see a trend towards german navel-gazing ? there is german navel-gazing , that 's true - but there are also many counterbalances .
one merely needs to open one 's eyes .
that 's not the problem .
the problem is that it must be clear to the germans - as to all the others , too - that , 60 years after the war 's end , there should no longer be a purely national approach , especially in emotional terms .
one may express and describe it , but at the same time one should make clear there 's always another perspective . oliver samson interviewed christina weiss -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .

the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .
" it has also been taken over by other countries , but it 's getting a bit long in the tooth .
we have to be more flexible and offer greater incentives to companies to employ more young people . " in other words , apprentices are paid too much in relation to the general economic development in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking the job postings hellmann praised steps the german government has taken to boost people 's incentives to work .
the controversial welfare reforms known as hartz iv came into force in january , cutting benefits for those unwilling to work .
the reforms are also intended to speed up job-hunting for others . " hartz iv was definitely a step in the right direction , but now we need jobs that will remain competitive in the long term , " hellmann said .
" we have to improve the basic conditions so that these jobs can be created .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .
do you also see a trend towards german navel-gazing ? there is german navel-gazing , that 's true - but there are also many counterbalances .
one merely needs to open one 's eyes .
that 's not the problem .
the problem is that it must be clear to the germans - as to all the others , too - that , 60 years after the war 's end , there should no longer be a purely national approach , especially in emotional terms .
one may express and describe it , but at the same time one should make clear there 's always another perspective . oliver samson interviewed christina weiss -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .

the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .
" it has also been taken over by other countries , but it 's getting a bit long in the tooth .
we have to be more flexible and offer greater incentives to companies to employ more young people . " in other words , apprentices are paid too much in relation to the general economic development in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking the job postings hellmann praised steps the german government has taken to boost people 's incentives to work .
the controversial welfare reforms known as hartz iv came into force in january , cutting benefits for those unwilling to work .
the reforms are also intended to speed up job-hunting for others . " hartz iv was definitely a step in the right direction , but now we need jobs that will remain competitive in the long term , " hellmann said .
" we have to improve the basic conditions so that these jobs can be created .

now you 've seen their exhibition " triumph and trauma - soviet and post-soviet remembrance of the war . "
will you remember to mention the museum the next time ?
state secretary for culture christina weiss : i never for a moment doubted that the exhibition is important .
after all , i did come to the opening .
in interviews you always think about what is closest to you .
and the german historical museum that i brought up in that one was for me always the word for the two exhibitions , which really belong together .
this exhibition is very impressive because it shows images that manipulate reflection , debate and opinions of history .
i do n't mean that negatively : they manipulate that which one knows about history , what one perceives , and how one positions oneself within it . we are reaching the highpoint of the year of remembrance of 1945 .
looking at the german historical construct that is being conveyed in the 2005 commemorations of the war 's end , what do you approve of and what do n't you like ? i find it especially good and important that right now , in the first year of the unification of large parts of europe through new eu entries , there are many events .
we must jointly think about how we can jointly talk about our history - something we have n't yet done .
every country does so through its own national perspective with differing valuation .
i hope that we will now - inspired by the commemoration of 1945 - collectively debate a collective view of our collective history .
to that extent , i appreciated everything that took this thought seriously .
the exhibitions in the german historical museum were very impressive - especially the exhibition that preceded this one , " myths of the nations . "
it always makes my blood run cold when i see how little " historical truth " there is .
there 's that which was experienced , the emotions - and the manipulation , too . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pan-european outlook on the past ?
in your speech at the exhibition 's opening , you talked about a " new complexity of national historical perception " of world war ii , but at the same time you hope for a pan-european perspective .
have we come a step closer to this in 2005 ? massively .
we have come closer to a collective view , because the openness has returned through the unification of europe .
we take note of what the others omit , what the others find difficult .
in the discussion - that we ourselves find difficult - we in germany are already quite far .
but we have n't done it with each other yet .
of course , we are not coming closer through this anniversary ; we 're coming closer through the unification of europe . what signals does german remembrance send to the world and how are they received ? i know that german remembrance sends important signals everywhere in the world .
it starts with our archives and continues with the bstu -lrb- the agency that handles the east german secret police files -rrb- .
we receive many enquiries : how do you manage this , how is this legally regulated , how do you deal with this ?
german remembrance is very broadly spread and , in the meantime , marked by a very honorable mindset .
it impresses people everywhere .
i do n't mean to say that all other countries need the same honorable mindset .
after all , we also have the larger burden to work through . still , in central and eastern european countries this discussion is also going on right now : how did we behave then ?
how did we deal with nazi rule ?
what did we do ?
all over there are joint historical commissions like between germany and poland or germany and the czech republic .
we have also created a " network forced migration and expulsion " in 20th century europe , which will start its work in may .
the headquarters will be in warsaw .
poland , the czech republic , slovakia , hungary , austria and germany will each send an employee there .
in addition , there will be a coordinator in each individual country , and we are establishing a board of " elder statesmen " who will promote the idea that there must be a collective examination of history . the exhibition in the german-russian museum in berlin is meant to be an explicit counterweight to an increasingly german perspective when it comes to the perception of history .
do you also see a trend towards german navel-gazing ? there is german navel-gazing , that 's true - but there are also many counterbalances .
one merely needs to open one 's eyes .
that 's not the problem .
the problem is that it must be clear to the germans - as to all the others , too - that , 60 years after the war 's end , there should no longer be a purely national approach , especially in emotional terms .
one may express and describe it , but at the same time one should make clear there 's always another perspective . oliver samson interviewed christina weiss -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany and russia honor wwii losses sixty years after world war ii , russia and germany have joined hands to honor the victims .

the study also found the juvenile unemployment situation to be especially worrying . in an international comparison , germany comes off fairly well where joblessness among young people is concerned , even though more than half a million youths are registered as unemployed .
but that is no reason to let it off the hook , according to the bertelsmann foundation , which seeks to assist in solving social problems . " juvenile unemployment is becoming more and more firmly established , " said the foundation 's thorsten hellmann .
" although germany is in eighth place among the 21 major industrialized nations that we compared , some of the other countries have managed to make considerable progress in reducing youth unemployment , whereas here , the jobless rate remains constant at around 10.5 percent . " the report is particularly critical of the lack of flexibility on the german job market , citing as an example the general practice in sectors like the building industry that are highly dependent on the weather .
it said it would make more sense to let apprentices complete their vocational schooling in the winter rather than interrupt their practical training in the summer , when the weather is more stable . praise for apprentice system on the whole , the bertelsmann study praised germany 's training system , which involves theory and practice , but said it is in need of modernization . " our dual training scheme is still a success , " said hellmann .
" it has also been taken over by other countries , but it 's getting a bit long in the tooth .
we have to be more flexible and offer greater incentives to companies to employ more young people . " in other words , apprentices are paid too much in relation to the general economic development in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : checking the job postings hellmann praised steps the german government has taken to boost people 's incentives to work .
the controversial welfare reforms known as hartz iv came into force in january , cutting benefits for those unwilling to work .
the reforms are also intended to speed up job-hunting for others . " hartz iv was definitely a step in the right direction , but now we need jobs that will remain competitive in the long term , " hellmann said .
" we have to improve the basic conditions so that these jobs can be created .

the car used on race day will have been exhaustively tested , every last inch of it .
so says max walshe , chief architect for bar 's pc systems , who heads the team making software that models the race cars in painstaking detail and then sends them careering round simulated tracks .
bar honda was in the news this week as it was given a two-race ban for breaking formula one rules governing the weight of the car .
test track mr walshe said the hectic schedule of tests for the real cars means simulation is essential for working out designs for future vehicles .
bar suspended for two races one of the first parts of the process is exhaustively measuring the race cars and subjecting every component to a battery of tests to establish their mechanical characteristics and how they perform in different conditions .
at the end of every race all the data gathered about how the car and its components performed is fed back into the design and testing process .
this realism ensures that the cars being flung around the simulated circuits react just like the real ones .
" we test the cars without testing the cars , " he said .
" and because we can model the car mathematically we can model hypothetical cars . "
" at the end of the day we are looking for an edge ... , " max walshe , bar honda mr walshe said the engineers can ask what would happen to lap times if a hypothetical aerodynamic shape was used ?
the team create custom tracks that endlessly make a car perform the same manoeuvre , such as shimmying through a chicane , to ensure it handles well in every possible situation .
but care has to be taken to ensure that the computers driving the cars round the virtual tracks match human characteristics .
" computers can drive cars much better than human drivers can and they can drive cars that humans would not have a chance with , " said mr walshe .
in the uk , bar employs more than 400 people to design , test and prepare cars for formula one races .
testing and simulation has to be done quickly too because one season lasts only 19 weekends .
it uses software from compuware to make sure the programs run without problems .
heavy testing the cars being simulated typically differ slightly from the actual vehicles to help bar home in on improvements that will make a difference on race day .
" it 's all about identifying trends , " he said .
one aspect of the car 's construction that does get a lot of tweaking is weight distribution .
" the rules determine how it 's going to look and are quite rigid " said mr walshe , " but there 's still a lot of room for manoeuvre and you can certainly identify different weight distributions .
" the rules do not say you must have weight distributions of 50/50 front and back . "
" that 's a parameter we play around with quite a lot , " he said .
" the car has a lot of ballast in it that we can move around to achieve the front / rear spread of weight . "
the result of the testing and simulation runs might be recommendations on where to use lighter components , or where to site ballast for the best result .
" it 's a constant loop , " said mr walshe .
" we are feeding into that initially when we are designing the car and saying what 's desirable and what 's not .
then the designers go off and design these components and match these criteria . "
this process can mean big changes in cars from year to year .
typically , said mr walshe , only 20 % of the components in a car stay the same from one season to the next .
" at the end of the day we are looking for an edge , " said mr walshe .
" you are not going to find something that goes two seconds a lap faster but you might find something that goes 0.2 seconds faster and in formula one that 's a long time . "

a group of politicians , academics and human rights campaigners have signed an open letter attacking russia 's record on democracy and political freedom .
they say official ceremonies to be held in moscow undermine the memory of those who fought and died in the war .
signatories include ex-czech president vaclav havel and former us ambassadors .
moscow has also upset neighbours georgia , estonia and lithuania , who all plan to boycott monday 's ceremonies . "
russia 's retreat from freedom and democracy in the post-soviet era has never seemed more rapid or broad scale " extract from the open letter georgian president mikhail saakashvili is staying away because russia and georgia have failed to agree on a timetable for closing soviet-era bases in his country .
in a separate row , estonia and lithuania are boycotting the ceremonies because they say their liberation from the nazis marked the start of soviet occupation .
latvia will send dignitaries - but along with estonia and lithuania it wants russia to apologise for the baltic states ' annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
russia sees itself as the main power which helped bring freedom to europe , defeating the nazis at an enormous human cost - 30m soviet lives were lost .
' mockery ' russian president vladimir putin said recently that the three baltic states had been " treated as pawns in world politics " but said moscow had already apologised and would not do so again .
" must we do this every day , every year ?
that is downright senseless , " he told german television .
pro-democracy campaigners in europe and the us have expressed growing concerns about modern russia .
in the letter , to be published in full in the uk 's financial times newspaper to coincide with the 9 may ceremonies , signatories accuse russia of betraying the principles behind victory in 1945 .
they write : " -lsb- we -rsb- believe the venue and hosting of this event are altogether unsuited to the fundamental principles for which that historic victory ... was achieved . "
russia in 2005 lacks strong democratic institutions , while political freedoms , civil liberties and the rule of law are weak , the signatories allege .
" it seems to us a mockery of the occasion to gather there in honour of the 20th century 's climactic sacrifice for europe 's freedom . "
as well as mr havel , the letter 's 75 signatories include former prime ministers of estonia and bulgaria and academics and democracy activists from eastern and western europe and the us .
several current and former members of the european parliament , us congress and uk parliament also signed the letter .
richard allen , former national security adviser to former us president ronald reagan , has signed , alongside several former ambassadors .
russia has been accused of concentrating too much power in the hands of the kremlin , and us secretary of state condoleezza rice recently criticised levels of media freedom .

a group of politicians , academics and human rights campaigners have signed an open letter attacking russia 's record on democracy and political freedom .
they say official ceremonies to be held in moscow undermine the memory of those who fought and died in the war .
signatories include ex-czech president vaclav havel and former us ambassadors .
moscow has also upset neighbours georgia , estonia and lithuania , who all plan to boycott monday 's ceremonies .
russia 's retreat from freedom and democracy in the post-soviet era has never seemed more rapid or broad scale extract from the open letter georgian president mikhail saakashvili is staying away because russia and georgia have failed to agree on a timetable for closing soviet-era bases in his country .
in a separate row , estonia and lithuania are boycotting the ceremonies because they say their liberation from the nazis marked the start of soviet occupation .
latvia will send dignitaries - but along with estonia and lithuania it wants russia to apologise for the baltic states ' annexation by the soviet union in 1940 .
russia sees itself as the main power which helped bring freedom to europe , defeating the nazis at an enormous human cost - 30m soviet lives were lost .
' mockery ' russian president vladimir putin said recently that the three baltic states had been " treated as pawns in world politics " but said moscow had already apologised and would not do so again .
" must we do this every day , every year ?

russia in 2005 lacks strong democratic institutions , while political freedoms , civil liberties and the rule of law are weak , the signatories allege .

analysis by david cowling editor , bbc political research labour has won power - but suffered a 6 % drop in the share of its vote .
the liberal democrats were the main gainers .
but just as labour has been ejected from some of the tory-leaning suburban seats it won in 1997 , its support among key middle class social groups also shows signs of haemorrhaging .
click here to see how the electorate voted by age , sex , and social class however , it has done better than expected among women , where it eliminated the " gender gap " , which in the past meant women were more likely than men to vote conservative .
poll tracker see who 's up and who 's down in the polls since january poll tracker did the opinion polls get it right ?
but labour is no longer ahead of the conservatives among lower middle class voters -lrb- c1 -rrb- , which they cultivated in 1997 .
and its support among working class voters and council tenants has dropped sharply .
however , it has hung onto much of its support among owner-occupiers with a mortgage , who used to be the bedrock of conservative support .
the liberal democrats made strong gains among young people aged 18-24 , where they are now ahead of the conservatives .
but they did less well in conservative-lib dem marginals , where there was actually a swing to the tories - possibly because they are now seen as to the left of labour .
the conservatives , whose total vote share was unchanged , were the main gainers of the reduced labour share of the vote , especially in southern england .
the biggest swing towards them among voting groups was among voters over 65 years old .
there were strong regional variations , especially between the north and scotland -lrb- where the liberal democrats did well -rrb- and london and the south east , where the conservatives were the main gainers .
the gender gap middle class voters young and old liberal democrats labour conservatives one word of caution : at present we can only extrapolate the demographic results of this election by using the eve-of-poll opinion polls conducted by the main polling organisations like nop , icm and populus .
given that they came reasonably close to predicting the actual result , this can give us some guidance on which groups switched their loyalty - but it is the trend , rather than the raw figures , which matters .
we can then look at the social composition and swings in key seats to confirm these trends , and also compare them to the exit poll figures in labour 's landslide victory in 1997 .
school-gate mums labour spent much of its effort in cultivating the votes of " hard-working families , " and especially women with children in the middle two social groups .
labour has targeted the family vote and they appear to have had some success - both icm and nop find that labour received the same amount of support among men and women .
this is an important result - up until 1997 the conservatives were boosted by the fact that their support among women was around 5 % higher than their support among men .
social change may be affecting this result - with more women working than in 1997 , and fewer male trade unionists .
but it may also be a measure of the fact that labour enjoyed a very large lead on issues like childcare , the health service , and education , that are particularly important to many women with children .
return to the top middle class voters labour 's appeal in 1997 was across all social classes -lrb- and all tenures -rrb- .
tony blair managed to win a greatly increased share of the middle class vote , including a plurality over the conservatives among lower middle class -lrb- c2 -rrb- voters and home owners , while holding on to labour 's working class vote .
based on our polling data in the 2005 general election , labour 's support is eroding at both ends .
two out of three of the opinion polls -lrb- nop and icm -rrb- suggest that the conservatives narrowly beat labour among the c2 group this time .
and labour 's share of the unskilled working class vote has declined sharply .
according to icm , labour was supported by 58 % of these voters in 1997 , and just 45 % in 2005 .
however , labour has retained support among owner-occupiers with a mortgage - who perhaps are giving labour credit for low interest rates .
they still have a 39 % to 30 % lead compared to the conservatives -lrb- in 1992 , the conservatives led in this group by 48 % to 30 % -rrb- .
finally , the liberal democrats have increased their share of the upper middle class vote - mainly at the expense of the conservatives .
return to the top young and old the liberal democrats have made strong gains among young people during the 2005 election , according to an analysis of opinion polls .
older voters tend to support the conservatives icm suggests that they have overtaken the conservatives among voters aged between 18-24 and also those between 25-34 .
this has mainly been at the expense of labour , who gained a spectacular 58 % of the 18-29 age group in 1997 , according to the nop / bbc exit poll .
-lrb- they have 42 % of the slightly small 18-24 group , according to icm now -rrb- .
the fall in labour 's support among the middle age group , the 34-64 year old " hard-working families " , exactly parallels its support in the electorate as a whole , according to icm .
the only social group that has remained solidly conservative are older voters , with the over 65s -lrb- and over 55s -rrb- giving them around a 6 % to 10 % conservative lead - almost exactly the same as in 1997 .
return to the top liberal democrats the liberal democrats were the main gainers in this election in terms of the popular vote - up from 19 % to 23 % .
charles kennedy 's party scored some successes against labour but their pattern of gains in seats was highly skewed , reflecting how they had positioned themselves in different parts of the country .
they seemed to have succeeded in positioning themselves as the party to the left of labour over issues like the iraq war and student tuition fees .
this has helped them in their labour- lib dem marginals where they made some spectacular gains .
but it also meant that they did worse than expected in the conservative - lib dem marginals , where they actually had more losses than gains .
in the 25 most marginal labour - lib dem seats , the swing to the lib dems averaged 6.7 % .
overall , they gained 12 seats from labour , including big gains in some student seats , including a 17 % swing in manchester withington , a 15 % swing in cambridge , and a 14 % swing in hornsey and wood green .
but they lost five seats to the conservatives , while only gaining three .
in the top 25 most marginal conservative - lib dem seats , there was actually a swing to the tories of 1.6 % the liberal democrats also did much better in scotland , the north west and the north east - and worst in devon and cornwall .
iraq was a key issue in explaining lib dem gains .
an early mori poll for the gmb showed that among labour defectors to the lib dems , 33 % cited iraq as a key influence on how they would vote .
return to the top labour labour lost 47 seats , and their share of the vote went down to 36 % , compared to 41 % in 2001 and 43 % in 1997 .
tony blair must get used to working with a smaller majority they will govern with only 22 % of the electorate having voting for them , when taking turnout into account .
nevertheless labour has a substantial , though reduced , working majority in parliament .
this is because the electoral system still favours labour .
labour needs a smaller share of the vote to win power because each of their seats is smaller than the average conservative seat - and this difference wo n't be corrected until the boundary commission revises the 1997 boundaries -lrb- in 2007 -rrb- .
labour lost votes to a variety of opposition parties , not just the conservatives , as well - including big swings in blaenau gwent in wales -lrb- where a labour-imposed women candidate was rejected -rrb- and bethnal and bow in east london , where the anti-war former labour mp george galloway defeated the sitting labour mp .
and it lost heavily among students where both iraq and student tuition fees provided a potent combination for the lib dems .
but there was a strong regional effect , with the biggest swings against labour -lrb- outside student and ethnic minority seats -rrb- concentrated in london and the south east .
however , many labour voters were backed their party because of negative views about other parties -lrb- 52 % -rrb- rather than enthusiasm for the labour party -lrb- 45 % -rrb- , according to a populus poll - and 53 % of labour voters said they would prefer labour to be re-elected with a smaller majority .
return to the top conservatives the conservatives achieved a rather remarkable result .
their share of the vote has been stuck at around 33 % for the last three elections .
most tory gains were made in the south of england nevertheless , they managed to gain 33 seats - to take their total in parliament to around 200 .
they did this by concentrating their vote more in the seats that mattered most - particularly in the south , and in lib dem / tory marginals .
only one of the intended targets of lib dem " decapitation " - tim collins in westmorland - lost his seat , while key tories like david davies , oliver letwin , and theresa may beat off lib dem challenges .
the tories achieved a swing against labour - especially in london and the south east - partly through a decline in the labour vote , rather than an increase in their own .
but they returned to power in suburban london , with big swings seats like putney , wimbledon , and enfield southgate , as well as home county seats like welwyn hatfield , peterborough , and st albans .
and they regained similar seats - like newbury and guildford - from the liberal democrats , while beating off the lib dem challenge in all but three seats .
but it was the negative image of mr howard among voters - which increased during the campaign - that was their biggest electoral liability .
therefore his resignation should not come as a total surprise .

analysis by david cowling editor , bbc political research labour has won power - but suffered a 6 % drop in the share of its vote .
the liberal democrats were the main gainers .
but just as labour has been ejected from some of the tory-leaning suburban seats it won in 1997 , its support among key middle class social groups also shows signs of haemorrhaging .
however , it has done better than expected among women , where it eliminated the " gender gap " , which in the past meant women were more likely than men to vote conservative .
poll tracker see who 's up and who 's down in the polls since january but labour is no longer ahead of the conservatives among lower middle class voters -lrb- c1 -rrb- , which they cultivated in 1997 .
and its support among working class voters and council tenants has dropped sharply .
however , it has hung onto much of its support among owner-occupiers with a mortgage , who used to be the bedrock of conservative support .
the liberal democrats made strong gains among young people aged 18-24 , where they are now ahead of the conservatives .
but they did less well in conservative-lib dem marginals , where there was actually a swing to the tories - possibly because they are now seen as to the left of labour .
the conservatives , whose total vote share was unchanged , were the main gainers of the reduced labour share of the vote , especially in southern england .
the biggest swing towards them among voting groups was among voters over 65 years old .
there were strong regional variations , especially between the north and scotland -lrb- where the liberal democrats did well -rrb- and london and the south east , where the conservatives were the main gainers .
one word of caution : at present we can only extrapolate the demographic results of this election by using the eve-of-poll opinion polls conducted by the main polling organisations like nop , icm and populus .
given that they came reasonably close to predicting the actual result , this can give us some guidance on which groups switched their loyalty - but it is the trend , rather than the raw figures , which matters .
we can then look at the social composition and swings in key seats to confirm these trends , and also compare them to the exit poll figures in labour 's landslide victory in 1997 .
school-gate mums labour spent much of its effort in cultivating the votes of " hard-working families , " and especially women with children in the middle two social groups .
and they appear to have had some success - both icm and nop find that labour received the same amount of support among men and women .
this is an important result - up until 1997 the conservatives were boosted by the fact that their support among women was around 5 % higher than their support among men .
social change may be affecting this result - with more women working than in 1997 , and fewer male trade unionists .
but it may also be a measure of the fact that labour enjoyed a very large lead on issues like childcare , the health service , and education , that are particularly important to many women with children .
middle class voters labour 's appeal in 1997 was across all social classes -lrb- and all tenures -rrb- .
tony blair managed to win a greatly increased share of the middle class vote , including a plurality over the conservatives among lower middle class -lrb- c2 -rrb- voters and home owners , while holding on to labour 's working class vote .
based on our polling data in the 2005 general election , labour 's support is eroding at both ends .
two out of three of the opinion polls -lrb- nop and icm -rrb- suggest that the conservatives narrowly beat labour among the c2 group this time .
and labour 's share of the unskilled working class vote has declined sharply .
according to icm , labour was supported by 58 % of these voters in 1997 , and just 45 % in 2005 .
however , labour has retained support among owner-occupiers with a mortgage - who perhaps are giving labour credit for low interest rates .
they still have a 39 % to 30 % lead compared to the conservatives -lrb- in 1992 , the conservatives led in this group by 48 % to 30 % -rrb- .
finally , the liberal democrats have increased their share of the upper middle class vote - mainly at the expense of the conservatives .
young and old the liberal democrats have made strong gains among young people during the 2005 election , according to an analysis of opinion polls .
icm suggests that they have overtaken the conservatives among voters aged between 18-24 and also those between 25-34 .
this has mainly been at the expense of labour , who gained a spectacular 58 % of the 18-29 age group in 1997 , according to the nop / bbc exit poll .
-lrb- they have 42 % of the slightly small 18-24 group , according to icm now -rrb- .
the fall in labour 's support among the middle age group , the 34-64 year old " hard-working families " , exactly parallels its support in the electorate as a whole , according to icm .
the only social group that has remained solidly conservative are older voters , with the over 65s -lrb- and over 55s -rrb- giving them around a 6 % to 10 % conservative lead - almost exactly the same as in 1997 .
liberal democrats the liberal democrats were the main gainers in this election in terms of the popular vote - up from 19 % to 23 % .
but their pattern of gains in seats was highly skewed , reflecting how they had positioned themselves in different parts of the country .
they seemed to have succeeded in positioning themselves as the party to the left of labour over issues like the iraq war and student tuition fees .
this has helped them in their labour- lib dem marginals where they made some spectacular gains .
but it also meant that they did worse than expected in the conservative - lib dem marginals , where they actually had more losses than gains .
in the 25 most marginal labour - lib dem seats , the swing to the lib dems averaged 6.7 % .
overall , they gained 12 seats from labour , including big gains in some student seats , including a 17 % swing in manchester withington , a 15 % swing in cambridge , and a 14 % swing in hornsey and wood green .
but they lost five seats to the conservatives , while only gaining three .
in the top 25 most marginal conservative - lib dem seats , there was actually a swing to the tories of 1.6 % the liberal democrats also did much better in scotland , the north west and the north east - and worst in devon and cornwall .
iraq was a key issue in explaining lib dem gains .
an early mori poll for the gmb showed that among labour defectors to the lib dems , 33 % cited iraq as a key influence on how they would vote .
labour labour lost 47 seats , and their share of the vote went down to 36 % , compared to 41 % in 2001 and 43 % in 1997 .
they will govern with only 22 % of the electorate having voting for them , when taking turnout into account .
nevertheless labour has a substantial , though reduced , working majority in parliament .
this is because the electoral system still favours labour .
labour needs a smaller share of the vote to win power because each of their seats is smaller than the average conservative seat - and this difference wo n't be corrected until the boundary commission revises the 1997 boundaries -lrb- in 2007 -rrb- .
labour lost votes to a variety of opposition parties , not just the conservatives , as well - including big swings in blaenau gwent in wales -lrb- where a labour-imposed women candidate was rejected -rrb- and bethnal and bow in east london , where the anti-war former labour mp george galloway defeated the sitting labour mp .
and it lost heavily among students where both iraq and student tuition fees provided a potent combination for the lib dems .
but there was a strong regional effect , with the biggest swings against labour -lrb- outside student and ethnic minority seats -rrb- concentrated in london and the south east .
however , many labour voters were backed their party because of negative views about other parties -lrb- 52 % -rrb- rather than enthusiasm for the labour party -lrb- 45 % -rrb- , according to a populus poll - and 53 % of labour voters said they would prefer labour to be re-elected with a smaller majority .
conservatives the conservatives achieved a rather remarkable result .
their share of the vote has been stuck at around 33 % for the last three elections .
nevertheless , they managed to gain 33 seats - to take their total in parliament to around 200 .
they did this by concentrating their vote more in the seats that mattered most - particularly in the south , and in lib dem / tory marginals .
only one of the intended targets of lib dem " decapitation " - tim collins in westmorland - lost his seat , while key tories like david davies , oliver letwin , and theresa may beat off lib dem challenges .
the tories achieved a swing against labour - especially in london and the south east - partly through a decline in the labour vote , rather than an increase in their own .
but they returned to power in suburban london , with big swings seats like putney , wimbledon , and enfield southgate , as well as home county seats like welwyn hatfield , peterborough , and st albans .
and they regained similar seats - like newbury and guildford - from the liberal democrats , while beating off the lib dem challenge in all but three seats .
but it was the negative image of mr howard among voters - which increased during the campaign - that was their biggest electoral liability .
therefore his resignation should not come as a total surprise .
nop interviewed a sample of 1000 on 2-3 may , margin of error + / -3 % .
populus interviewed a sample of 2042 between 2-3 may , margin of error + / -2 % .
icm interviewed a sample of 937 between 1-3 may , margin of error + / - 3 % .

at the whitefoord house for veterans , in the city 's canongate , survivors have a chance to discuss the events of 1939-45 which changed their lives .
while ve day on 8 may will be a day of happiness and commemoration , survivors lost many friends and relatives in the fight to defeat nazi germany .
peter dakers lost his twin brother fighting the japanese in burma whitefoord house , run by the scottish veterans ' residences , offers residents privacy , security , an opportunity to meet new friends and a place to invite family and friends .
it has 81 fully furnished en-suite rooms and 11 self-contained flats available for rent .
peter dakers , 86 , fought with the royal scots battalion in burma and was in charge of 16 other men .
" my twin , jack , was in charge of another battalion of 16 men and both sets of troops set out on 4 april , 1943 , " peter told me over a cup of tea at whitefoord house .
" but he and his men were taken prisoner and killed .
they never returned .
my brother 's body was never found and to this day i think of him .
" i was wounded on 4 april , 1944 when a bullet lodged in my arm .
it remains there to this day .
staff at edinburgh royal infirmary tried and failed to take it out in 1974 .
" i think of my battalion , my brother and the things we did . "
there are only about seven or eight of us now , but we have a good laugh and enjoy the patter peter dakers there were a few veterans in the home as i talked to peter .
most were sitting at a table at the far end of the room , with a plume of smoke circling above them as they spoke .
another veteran was sitting laughing at a laurel and hardy film on the television .
peter said the camaraderie among soldiers during the war was still enjoyed by survivors today .
" we meet at the tollbooth pub about 200 yards up the road every fourth thursday , " he said .
" there are only about seven or eight of us now , but we have a good laugh and enjoy the patter .
" as president of the group , i send letters to other veterans across the world in canada , new zealand and denmark .
it 's marvellous , great . "
dealing with war when i asked him to describe conflict to someone who has never fought in a war , he replied : " you just take it as it comes .
" you have different ideas on how to handle it as you rise through the ranks .
as a sergeant , for instance , you have to be responsible for all your men . "
peter has lived at whitefoord house for eight months and says he misses his late wife terribly , whom he met in 1937 and who died three years ago .
born in port glasgow and brought up in leith after his father died , peter said he was proud to have served with the royal scots , " the oldest regiment in the british army " .
we were taught that the machine in the sky was the enemy vee robinson vera robinson , vee to her friends , was a gunner with the royal artillery during the five-year conflict .
the 82-year-old said the gunner-teams had to enjoy each others ' company because they had to be together at all times .
" we moved about a few times and for a period i was stationed at the forth bridge , " she said .
" we were in a hut , tent or command post all the time .
you could n't be alone and sometimes the oldest woman there , the peacemaker among us , would tell us all to calm down .
reunion plans " it always had the desired effect .
in saying that , i never remember falling out with anyone . "
vee , originally from durham , said a lot of the veterans she fought alongside were now widows .
" but we are a company to this day , there is no other word for it , " she went on .
" we 're scattered all over , but still help each other .
i 've been a widow since i was 50 and appreciate the bond we still share . "
a veterans ' reunion will be held on 3 and 4 september in warwickshire and vee said that although it takes a lot of hard work to organise , it is well worth seeing everyone again .
she said it will probably be her last such event but she will not look back with any regrets .
" i 've had a good life , " she said smiling .
when i asked her if she felt any remorse for the german pilots she gunned down during the conflict , vee shook her head .
whitefoord house offers veterans a focal point for discussion " we were so well trained .
humanity did n't come into it , " she said .
" we were taught that the machine in the sky was the enemy .
we needed to know the shape of every aircraft .
we were taught not to think .
" we only thought about the bombs the planes were dropping to kill our people .
now , we would say , all those men were somebody 's father .
" but when the alarm went , you were on your instrument and your job was to bring that plane down somewhere in a field . "
she added : " it was marvellous , if the training was that good you do n't even think about the human cost . "
the veteran said her eardrum " went " during the conflict and added : " i have a war wound !
i 've never said that before . "
she went on : " we had to win the war and glory-be we did . "
the germans ' use of v2 rockets were the most frightening part of the war because they were impossible to combat , vee added .
she said she was happy at whitefoord house because she felt safe there and felt under threat in her previous home .
when asked how she felt about the general election and whether we had learned anything from the war , she said : " we were influenced by the us over iraq , but we do n't need them - we 're british . "
david lunann said whitefoord house has saved his life david lunann , 86 , fought in north africa and said his job was to clear mines and create a safe passage for troops , machinery and tanks .
he was injured by shrapnel and spent nine months in hospital before the end of the conflict .
yet david said : " being in the military was the best part of my life .
when i was at home i did n't have the best of times and was being moved about quite a lot .
" my wife died seven years ago and i do n't know what would have happened to me if i had n't come to whitefoord house .
" in fact i probably would n't be here today . "
david plays bingo and " enjoys a blether " every week at the local masonic club down the road .
" i 'm not a big drinker , so it 's good to have something else to do . "

this south wales valley seat was once the political home of such socialist figureheads as nhs founder aneurin bevan and labour leader michael foot .
but it overturned decades of labour domination to send independent socialist mr law to westminster .
" he 's more labour than anyone else , " said voter jeannette webb .
mr law 's opposition to all-women shortlists to pick the labour candidate struck a chord in blaenau gwent , the seat he now represents in both the welsh assembly and parliament . "
he 's a decent man and people really objected to the way we had a woman foisted on us " jeannette webb one of the smallest boroughs in wales and one which rarely enjoys any wider publicity , it has clearly relished earning its place in history .
" it is excellent , " said mrs webb , who works at marshall 's newsagents in ebbw vale .
" i was n't surprised , but i thought it might be closer than it was .
" people all decided to support him , he is very good for this area .
he 's a decent man and people really objected to the way we had a woman foisted on us . "
the usual hustle and bustle of the friday market in ebbw vale added to the headline-grabbing buzz around the town as the new mp went on a walkabout to thank his voters .
his victory was all the more remarkable because he underwent major surgery for a brain tumour in the week the election was announced .
he learned of his condition only days before and was widely expected to pull out . "
if i advertised for only a man or a woman to do a job here , i would be prosecuted " businessman stephen young " i used to work for him , " said barry carson , sales assistant at walters photograph shop .
" he pops in now and again and he is a good customer .
he 's a nice representative for blaenau gwent .
" i just think the best person won , i thought he might just pip it at the end - but 9,000 -lrb- his majority -rrb- is superb . "
" i stayed up all night to watch it . "
kathryn noble , deputy manager at walters , added : " after hearing he was n't going to stand we were a bit devastated .
" i do n't think it was a sympathy vote , there is genuine feeling for him . "
another businessman , stephen young of country choice , said : " i 'm really glad he did stand .
" this is a message to the government .
law is the right man for the job .
" maggie jones -lrb- labour candidate -rrb- might have made a good mp had she been put forward in a different manner .
" but if i advertised for only a man or a woman to do a job here , i would be prosecuted . "
interest was so great that the local newsagent sold out .
shopper pat pearce said : " i have already bought the western mail to read all about it .
it makes the whole thing more interesting .
" our previous mp stood up and said what he wanted and we have always had outspoken mps . "
in nearby nantyglo , where peter law lives and once ran a general store , david baldwin said : " i have lived here for 43 years and i know him .
he 's a nice fellow and he deserves to get it .
i 've been a labour voter all my life - but i changed my vote this time - and my son did too , " he added .
