german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget . " we 'll find that out over the course of the day , " she told journalists as she arrived for a second day of talks in brussels .
" we will make every effort , but i can not at this moment say whether we will succeed or not .
the talks are in the truest sense of the word very difficult . " the eu was resuming last-ditch efforts friday to resolve its budget deadlock after a first evening of talks described as tense and blunt appeared to make little headway , with britain rebuffing intense pressure over its rebate . prime minister tony blair conceded that divisions remained wide , but insisted all sides realized the urgency of striking a deal , in particular to release money for poorer european union -lrb- eu -rrb- newcomer states . " we 're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it 's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation , " blair said after chairing a first round of discussions at a two-day summit thursday evening .

" there was a kind of tension , but it was not aggressiveness . " swedish prime minister göran persson said " huge differences " remained , estimating there was only a " 50-50 " chance of a deal .

" germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court as he searches for greater powers to prosecute germany 's own " war on terror . " schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday said it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper , as quoted by news magazine der spiegel .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .
zammar is a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states who was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 . " a few months in custody have already produced some information , " schäuble said .
" there are no signs to suggest that zammar has been tortured .
zammar has said to the bnd that he has been hit , however , not in syria , but in lebanon or somewhere else where he has been before , and not in connection with the examination . " schäuble added that the majority of the german people wanted their politicians to do all they could to keep them protected but that those with responsibility must pay attention to how far their efforts go .

one of them attracted blume 's attention , as three blue bags with the logo of world soccer federation fifa were lying inside . blume opened the bags and found 32 pieces of orange paper that had played the leading role in the tv extravaganza .
written on them were the names of the soccer teams that will participate in the world cup next year and they had been used in the draw .

german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget .

" we 're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it 's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation , " blair said after chairing a first round of discussions at a two-day summit thursday evening .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .
the aluminum tubing could , in principle , be used to adapt an existing missile into a multistage rocket capable of traveling up to 10,000 kilometers - which would put the united states in range . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .
the aluminum tubing could , in principle , be used to adapt an existing missile into a multistage rocket capable of traveling up to 10,000 kilometers - which would put the united states in range . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .

" germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court as he searches for greater powers to prosecute germany 's own " war on terror . " schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday said it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper , as quoted by news magazine der spiegel .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .
zammar is a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states who was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 . " a few months in custody have already produced some information , " schäuble said .
" there are no signs to suggest that zammar has been tortured .
zammar has said to the bnd that he has been hit , however , not in syria , but in lebanon or somewhere else where he has been before , and not in connection with the examination . " schäuble added that the majority of the german people wanted their politicians to do all they could to keep them protected but that those with responsibility must pay attention to how far their efforts go .
politicians must not be allowed to be " unrestrained " in the quest for security . however , some germans have expressed outrage at the treatment of zammar and the conditions in which he is being kept in the notorious far-filastin prison , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters which human rights groups claim is a torture center .
when suspected crimes lead a person to be detained in such a facility , schäuble said that no-one could expect " a hotel room with a jacuzzi . " schäuble : terror trai n i n g should be pu n ishable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants anyone who undertook training in a terror camp to be punished schäuble also told the newspaper that he wanted to push the law to be more effective in the fight against terrorism .
he wants suspects where there is no firm evidence only suspicion to be allowed to be brought to court .
in addition , schäuble wanted " the graduation from an education in terrorism , from a camp in afghanistan or anywhere else " to be a punishable act from now on . the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . schäuble wa n ts bu n deswehr deployed at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the interior minister gets his way , bundeswehr troops will be deployed on home soil in terms of homeland security , the interior minister announced a basic law change that would allow the deployment of the german armed forces in a national capacity , with the 2006 world cup in mind .
in the coalition negotiations , this subject - along with air security proposals - had been left to the judgment of the federal constitutional court .
the judgment is expected in february . such deployment is currently only legal in exceptional circumstances and with the support of both houses of parliament .
germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a militarized police state . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble said .
" why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them . "
schäuble added that the armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd , " he said .

" not everything is resolved but we are heading little by little towards a solution ... which would allow us to get out of this difficulty , this impasse , " he said as a crunch summit headed into its final hours . talks on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget have been stalled due to britain 's refusal to give further ground on its long-cherished rebate , and france 's resistance to reform of the bloc 's disputed farm subsidy system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair believes any deal wo n't be an ideal one for anyone , including britain a european source said that in its latest proposal friday , britain offered to cut an extra 2.5 billion euros off its eu rebate , from which it had already proposed slashing 8 billion euros over the seven-year period .
budget dominates all the new offer was presented to eu leaders on the second evening of a summit dominated by the budget wrangle .
the other key problem has been french resistance to reforming the bloc 's generous farm subsidy system . chirac voiced cautious optimism of a deal . " i have n't got an answer at this moment to the question : will there be an agreement ?
the discussions are fairly positive , " he told reporters , but added that the state of negotiations was " fairly positive . " meanwhile an eu source added that britain was proposing a total eu budget for 2007-2013 of 862.5 billion euros , increasing its previous proposal by 13.2 billion euros . if confirmed , it would match a proposal by german chancellor angela merkel , whose country has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu budget deal uncertain german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2005 germany , eu condemn iran leader 's comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad 's words have caused outrage and his actions are raising fears recent outbursts against israel have brought iran international condemnation .
as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .
the aluminum tubing could , in principle , be used to adapt an existing missile into a multistage rocket capable of traveling up to 10,000 kilometers - which would put the united states in range . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .

" those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .

" the emerging direction of the meeting is worrying , " he said .
" in the main trade-boosting areas of the discussions , the level of ambition , if anything , is going backwards .
i do not want to contemplate a failure at hong kong .
but equally i see no point in an outcome here that simply locks in low ambitions , diminishes benefits for developing countries and falls short of our responsibilities to the global economy .
i would find it difficult to sign up to such a rolling-back of ambitions . " us trade officials meanwhile repeated their charge that it was the eu that had to move . " the whole round is being held hostage by the failure ... of our major interlocutor to come up with ambitious offers on agriculture , " a us official told reporters , without directly naming the eu . drive some further i n to poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says the meeting 's direction is worrying the eu and us exchanges came amid growing frustration at the lack of progress in the doha round of talks which was launched in qatar in 2001 with the aim of freeing up global trade and specifically helping developing countries .
it is due to be completed by the end of 2006 . a major coalition of developing countries warned friday it would reject any deal that harmed their interests . " it appears that these talks will bring us nothing at all and even drive us further into poverty , " arvin boolel , mauritius ' minister of agriculture and chairman of the 56-member africa , caribbean and pacific group .
" this situation makes a mockery of the development agenda of this round .
we will not accept any agreement in hong kong that is made at our expense . " losi n g focus an australian official also expressed concern the meeting was losing focus . " there 's too much attention being paid to other issues but the fact remains that poor countries need access to wealthy markets - after all this is supposed to be a development round , " he told afp . the official said there was still a belief the hong kong conference could end on sunday with a positive outcome but he warned that it would take tough negotiation and more goodwill from all sides . the g20 and the cairns group of agricultural exporters , which australia leads , pressed the same point , urging the eu and the united states to budge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade representative rob portman is pressing for cuts in agriculture import tariffs " agriculture is at the center of this round and of the development dividends we seek from it , " the two groups said in a statement .
" those most responsible for such distortions must now face the difficult political decisions to move the round forward .
the dynamics of the negotiation require movements by both the eu and the usa .
it is time for them to display leadership . " the talks in hong kong were supposed to sign off on the framework for an overall accord , allowing the negotiations to conclude next year on time , but now the most that is hoped for is some deal to help the poorest countries . while the united states is pressing for a 55-90 percent cut in agricultural import tariffs , the european union has offered reductions in a range of 35 to 60 percent . on farm support , washington has said it is prepared to cut trade-distorting subsidies by 60 percent over five years , matched by an eu offer to make a 70 percent reduction in such assistance . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin americans slam eu banana policy at wto conference latin american nations on wednesday called on a world trade organization conference to condemn the european union 's new tariff plan for bananas , saying it flies in the face of the rules of global commerce .

" germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court as he searches for greater powers to prosecute germany 's own " war on terror . " schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday said it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper , as quoted by news magazine der spiegel .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .
zammar is a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states who was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 . " a few months in custody have already produced some information , " schäuble said .
" there are no signs to suggest that zammar has been tortured .
zammar has said to the bnd that he has been hit , however , not in syria , but in lebanon or somewhere else where he has been before , and not in connection with the examination . " schäuble added that the majority of the german people wanted their politicians to do all they could to keep them protected but that those with responsibility must pay attention to how far their efforts go .
politicians must not be allowed to be " unrestrained " in the quest for security . however , some germans have expressed outrage at the treatment of zammar and the conditions in which he is being kept in the notorious far-filastin prison , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters which human rights groups claim is a torture center .
when suspected crimes lead a person to be detained in such a facility , schäuble said that no-one could expect " a hotel room with a jacuzzi . " schäuble : terror trai n i n g should be pu n ishable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants anyone who undertook training in a terror camp to be punished schäuble also told the newspaper that he wanted to push the law to be more effective in the fight against terrorism .
he wants suspects where there is no firm evidence only suspicion to be allowed to be brought to court .
in addition , schäuble wanted " the graduation from an education in terrorism , from a camp in afghanistan or anywhere else " to be a punishable act from now on . the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . schäuble wa n ts bu n deswehr deployed at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the interior minister gets his way , bundeswehr troops will be deployed on home soil in terms of homeland security , the interior minister announced a basic law change that would allow the deployment of the german armed forces in a national capacity , with the 2006 world cup in mind .
in the coalition negotiations , this subject - along with air security proposals - had been left to the judgment of the federal constitutional court .
the judgment is expected in february . such deployment is currently only legal in exceptional circumstances and with the support of both houses of parliament .
germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a militarized police state . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble said .
" why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them . "
schäuble added that the armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd , " he said .

" not everything is resolved but we are heading little by little towards a solution ... which would allow us to get out of this difficulty , this impasse , " he said as a crunch summit headed into its final hours . talks on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget have been stalled due to britain 's refusal to give further ground on its long-cherished rebate , and france 's resistance to reform of the bloc 's disputed farm subsidy system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair believes any deal wo n't be an ideal one for anyone , including britain a european source said that in its latest proposal friday , britain offered to cut an extra 2.5 billion euros off its eu rebate , from which it had already proposed slashing 8 billion euros over the seven-year period .

" the emerging direction of the meeting is worrying , " he said .
" in the main trade-boosting areas of the discussions , the level of ambition , if anything , is going backwards .
i do not want to contemplate a failure at hong kong .
but equally i see no point in an outcome here that simply locks in low ambitions , diminishes benefits for developing countries and falls short of our responsibilities to the global economy .
i would find it difficult to sign up to such a rolling-back of ambitions . " us trade officials meanwhile repeated their charge that it was the eu that had to move . " the whole round is being held hostage by the failure ... of our major interlocutor to come up with ambitious offers on agriculture , " a us official told reporters , without directly naming the eu . drive some further i n to poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says the meeting 's direction is worrying the eu and us exchanges came amid growing frustration at the lack of progress in the doha round of talks which was launched in qatar in 2001 with the aim of freeing up global trade and specifically helping developing countries .
it is due to be completed by the end of 2006 . a major coalition of developing countries warned friday it would reject any deal that harmed their interests . " it appears that these talks will bring us nothing at all and even drive us further into poverty , " arvin boolel , mauritius ' minister of agriculture and chairman of the 56-member africa , caribbean and pacific group .
" this situation makes a mockery of the development agenda of this round .
we will not accept any agreement in hong kong that is made at our expense . " losi n g focus an australian official also expressed concern the meeting was losing focus . " there 's too much attention being paid to other issues but the fact remains that poor countries need access to wealthy markets - after all this is supposed to be a development round , " he told afp . the official said there was still a belief the hong kong conference could end on sunday with a positive outcome but he warned that it would take tough negotiation and more goodwill from all sides . the g20 and the cairns group of agricultural exporters , which australia leads , pressed the same point , urging the eu and the united states to budge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade representative rob portman is pressing for cuts in agriculture import tariffs " agriculture is at the center of this round and of the development dividends we seek from it , " the two groups said in a statement .
" those most responsible for such distortions must now face the difficult political decisions to move the round forward .
the dynamics of the negotiation require movements by both the eu and the usa .
it is time for them to display leadership . " the talks in hong kong were supposed to sign off on the framework for an overall accord , allowing the negotiations to conclude next year on time , but now the most that is hoped for is some deal to help the poorest countries . while the united states is pressing for a 55-90 percent cut in agricultural import tariffs , the european union has offered reductions in a range of 35 to 60 percent . on farm support , washington has said it is prepared to cut trade-distorting subsidies by 60 percent over five years , matched by an eu offer to make a 70 percent reduction in such assistance . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin americans slam eu banana policy at wto conference latin american nations on wednesday called on a world trade organization conference to condemn the european union 's new tariff plan for bananas , saying it flies in the face of the rules of global commerce .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .

" the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .

" not everything is resolved but we are heading little by little towards a solution ... which would allow us to get out of this difficulty , this impasse , " he said as a crunch summit headed into its final hours . talks on the european union 's 2007-2013 budget have been stalled due to britain 's refusal to give further ground on its long-cherished rebate , and france 's resistance to reform of the bloc 's disputed farm subsidy system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair believes any deal wo n't be an ideal one for anyone , including britain a european source said that in its latest proposal friday , britain offered to cut an extra 2.5 billion euros off its eu rebate , from which it had already proposed slashing 8 billion euros over the seven-year period .
budget dominates all the new offer was presented to eu leaders on the second evening of a summit dominated by the budget wrangle .
the other key problem has been french resistance to reforming the bloc 's generous farm subsidy system . chirac voiced cautious optimism of a deal . " i have n't got an answer at this moment to the question : will there be an agreement ?
the discussions are fairly positive , " he told reporters , but added that the state of negotiations was " fairly positive . " meanwhile an eu source added that britain was proposing a total eu budget for 2007-2013 of 862.5 billion euros , increasing its previous proposal by 13.2 billion euros . if confirmed , it would match a proposal by german chancellor angela merkel , whose country has long been the eu 's biggest net contributor . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel : eu budget deal uncertain german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .

" the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .

" germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court as he searches for greater powers to prosecute germany 's own " war on terror . " schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday said it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper , as quoted by news magazine der spiegel .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .
zammar is a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states who was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 . " a few months in custody have already produced some information , " schäuble said .
" there are no signs to suggest that zammar has been tortured .
zammar has said to the bnd that he has been hit , however , not in syria , but in lebanon or somewhere else where he has been before , and not in connection with the examination . " schäuble added that the majority of the german people wanted their politicians to do all they could to keep them protected but that those with responsibility must pay attention to how far their efforts go .
politicians must not be allowed to be " unrestrained " in the quest for security . however , some germans have expressed outrage at the treatment of zammar and the conditions in which he is being kept in the notorious far-filastin prison , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters which human rights groups claim is a torture center .
when suspected crimes lead a person to be detained in such a facility , schäuble said that no-one could expect " a hotel room with a jacuzzi . " schäuble : terror trai n i n g should be pu n ishable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants anyone who undertook training in a terror camp to be punished schäuble also told the newspaper that he wanted to push the law to be more effective in the fight against terrorism .
he wants suspects where there is no firm evidence only suspicion to be allowed to be brought to court .
in addition , schäuble wanted " the graduation from an education in terrorism , from a camp in afghanistan or anywhere else " to be a punishable act from now on . the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . schäuble wa n ts bu n deswehr deployed at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the interior minister gets his way , bundeswehr troops will be deployed on home soil in terms of homeland security , the interior minister announced a basic law change that would allow the deployment of the german armed forces in a national capacity , with the 2006 world cup in mind .
in the coalition negotiations , this subject - along with air security proposals - had been left to the judgment of the federal constitutional court .
the judgment is expected in february . such deployment is currently only legal in exceptional circumstances and with the support of both houses of parliament .
germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a militarized police state . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble said .
" why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them . "
schäuble added that the armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd , " he said .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .

" the emerging direction of the meeting is worrying , " he said .
" in the main trade-boosting areas of the discussions , the level of ambition , if anything , is going backwards .
i do not want to contemplate a failure at hong kong .
but equally i see no point in an outcome here that simply locks in low ambitions , diminishes benefits for developing countries and falls short of our responsibilities to the global economy .
i would find it difficult to sign up to such a rolling-back of ambitions . " us trade officials meanwhile repeated their charge that it was the eu that had to move . " the whole round is being held hostage by the failure ... of our major interlocutor to come up with ambitious offers on agriculture , " a us official told reporters , without directly naming the eu . drive some further i n to poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says the meeting 's direction is worrying the eu and us exchanges came amid growing frustration at the lack of progress in the doha round of talks which was launched in qatar in 2001 with the aim of freeing up global trade and specifically helping developing countries .
it is due to be completed by the end of 2006 . a major coalition of developing countries warned friday it would reject any deal that harmed their interests . " it appears that these talks will bring us nothing at all and even drive us further into poverty , " arvin boolel , mauritius ' minister of agriculture and chairman of the 56-member africa , caribbean and pacific group .
" this situation makes a mockery of the development agenda of this round .
we will not accept any agreement in hong kong that is made at our expense . " losi n g focus an australian official also expressed concern the meeting was losing focus . " there 's too much attention being paid to other issues but the fact remains that poor countries need access to wealthy markets - after all this is supposed to be a development round , " he told afp . the official said there was still a belief the hong kong conference could end on sunday with a positive outcome but he warned that it would take tough negotiation and more goodwill from all sides . the g20 and the cairns group of agricultural exporters , which australia leads , pressed the same point , urging the eu and the united states to budge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade representative rob portman is pressing for cuts in agriculture import tariffs " agriculture is at the center of this round and of the development dividends we seek from it , " the two groups said in a statement .
" those most responsible for such distortions must now face the difficult political decisions to move the round forward .
the dynamics of the negotiation require movements by both the eu and the usa .
it is time for them to display leadership . " the talks in hong kong were supposed to sign off on the framework for an overall accord , allowing the negotiations to conclude next year on time , but now the most that is hoped for is some deal to help the poorest countries . while the united states is pressing for a 55-90 percent cut in agricultural import tariffs , the european union has offered reductions in a range of 35 to 60 percent . on farm support , washington has said it is prepared to cut trade-distorting subsidies by 60 percent over five years , matched by an eu offer to make a 70 percent reduction in such assistance . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin americans slam eu banana policy at wto conference latin american nations on wednesday called on a world trade organization conference to condemn the european union 's new tariff plan for bananas , saying it flies in the face of the rules of global commerce .

" the emerging direction of the meeting is worrying , " he said .
" in the main trade-boosting areas of the discussions , the level of ambition , if anything , is going backwards .
i do not want to contemplate a failure at hong kong .
but equally i see no point in an outcome here that simply locks in low ambitions , diminishes benefits for developing countries and falls short of our responsibilities to the global economy .
i would find it difficult to sign up to such a rolling-back of ambitions . " us trade officials meanwhile repeated their charge that it was the eu that had to move . " the whole round is being held hostage by the failure ... of our major interlocutor to come up with ambitious offers on agriculture , " a us official told reporters , without directly naming the eu . drive some further i n to poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says the meeting 's direction is worrying the eu and us exchanges came amid growing frustration at the lack of progress in the doha round of talks which was launched in qatar in 2001 with the aim of freeing up global trade and specifically helping developing countries .
it is due to be completed by the end of 2006 . a major coalition of developing countries warned friday it would reject any deal that harmed their interests . " it appears that these talks will bring us nothing at all and even drive us further into poverty , " arvin boolel , mauritius ' minister of agriculture and chairman of the 56-member africa , caribbean and pacific group .
" this situation makes a mockery of the development agenda of this round .
we will not accept any agreement in hong kong that is made at our expense . " losi n g focus an australian official also expressed concern the meeting was losing focus . " there 's too much attention being paid to other issues but the fact remains that poor countries need access to wealthy markets - after all this is supposed to be a development round , " he told afp . the official said there was still a belief the hong kong conference could end on sunday with a positive outcome but he warned that it would take tough negotiation and more goodwill from all sides . the g20 and the cairns group of agricultural exporters , which australia leads , pressed the same point , urging the eu and the united states to budge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade representative rob portman is pressing for cuts in agriculture import tariffs " agriculture is at the center of this round and of the development dividends we seek from it , " the two groups said in a statement .
" those most responsible for such distortions must now face the difficult political decisions to move the round forward .
the dynamics of the negotiation require movements by both the eu and the usa .
it is time for them to display leadership . " the talks in hong kong were supposed to sign off on the framework for an overall accord , allowing the negotiations to conclude next year on time , but now the most that is hoped for is some deal to help the poorest countries . while the united states is pressing for a 55-90 percent cut in agricultural import tariffs , the european union has offered reductions in a range of 35 to 60 percent . on farm support , washington has said it is prepared to cut trade-distorting subsidies by 60 percent over five years , matched by an eu offer to make a 70 percent reduction in such assistance . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin americans slam eu banana policy at wto conference latin american nations on wednesday called on a world trade organization conference to condemn the european union 's new tariff plan for bananas , saying it flies in the face of the rules of global commerce .

but while supermodel-turned-host heidi klum and the soccer greats got to leave right after the show , blume stayed on to help clean things up . after the set design had been taken down , a few garbage containers were still standing around in leipzig 's convention center .
one of them attracted blume 's attention , as three blue bags with the logo of world soccer federation fifa were lying inside . blume opened the bags and found 32 pieces of orange paper that had played the leading role in the tv extravaganza .
written on them were the names of the soccer teams that will participate in the world cup next year and they had been used in the draw . " i could n't believe it - why would anyone throw these away , " blume told his local paper in the eastern german town of magdeburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- left -rrb- was pleased with the group germany ended up in not that blume himself seems too attached to them .
remembering how another young man made a fortune by selling a car previously owned by pope benedict xvi earlier this year , he decided to post the papers on online auction house ebay . he 's accepting bids until christmas and hopes to make 3,200 euros -lrb- $ 3,840 -rrb- . " it would be great if i could get 100 euros per piece , " he said . at least the " germany " ticket has already surpassed blume 's goal as someone is currently willing to pay 261 euros for it . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de luck on germany 's side in draw the route to a world cup final can be set in the first matches .

" the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .
the aluminum tubing could , in principle , be used to adapt an existing missile into a multistage rocket capable of traveling up to 10,000 kilometers - which would put the united states in range . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .

german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget . " we 'll find that out over the course of the day , " she told journalists as she arrived for a second day of talks in brussels .
" we will make every effort , but i can not at this moment say whether we will succeed or not .
the talks are in the truest sense of the word very difficult . " the eu was resuming last-ditch efforts friday to resolve its budget deadlock after a first evening of talks described as tense and blunt appeared to make little headway , with britain rebuffing intense pressure over its rebate . prime minister tony blair conceded that divisions remained wide , but insisted all sides realized the urgency of striking a deal , in particular to release money for poorer european union -lrb- eu -rrb- newcomer states . " we 're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it 's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation , " blair said after chairing a first round of discussions at a two-day summit thursday evening . " i think that everybody realizes that if we are going to do a deal on the budget , it 's now , " he noted . the iro n lady 's legacy the 2007-2013 budget is worth nearly 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.01 billion -rrb- and is vital to releasing much-needed funds to the relatively poor states from central and eastern europe which joined the bloc last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair is defending a deal secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 a deal is being held up by two key issues : britain 's refusal to part with its budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 , and french resistance to cutting back the union 's expensive farm subsidy system . failure to find a breakthrough would also deepen the sense of crisis over europe 's failure to get its painstakingly assembled constitution off the ground and could even threaten future enlargement . poland , along with france one of the most critical of the british proposal , including a substantial cutback in spending , said it expected blair to come up with a fresh offer in the morning . a log way to compromise " this new proposal is in the process of being worked upon and tomorrow it will be modified during bilateral meetings , " said polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , adding that talks were to resume friday morning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson gave the negotiations a 50-50 chance of success but participants warned much work remained to be done . " the gap is still very big because there was not a discussion on figures , that will start tomorrow , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
" there was a kind of tension , but it was not aggressiveness . " swedish prime minister göran persson said " huge differences " remained , estimating there was only a " 50-50 " chance of a deal . " the budget discussion was blunt , " persson said , but added : " every one of us realizes that if we do n't have a deal now it will not be easy next year . " a lasti n g revisio n ? thursday evening 's first session began with a 15-minute meeting between blair and his main rival , french president jacques chirac , as so often the two key players at the heart of the eu standoff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at loggerheads : french president jacques chirac , left , and british prime minister tony blair blair has already offered to surrender some 8 billion euros of britain 's rebate over the seven-year-budget term . but chirac is not only pushing for a bigger cut , but also " a lasting revision of the british rebate in terms of its mechanism and its amount , " his spokesman said . attention is focusing on a review clause in britain 's proposal : to revisit the budget at some time during the budget period , based on the recommendations of a report to be drawn up by barroso 's commission . the clause could see britain put its rebate up for more long-term review in exchange for a comprehensive reform of the spending package .

german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget . " we 'll find that out over the course of the day , " she told journalists as she arrived for a second day of talks in brussels .
" we will make every effort , but i can not at this moment say whether we will succeed or not .
the talks are in the truest sense of the word very difficult . " the eu was resuming last-ditch efforts friday to resolve its budget deadlock after a first evening of talks described as tense and blunt appeared to make little headway , with britain rebuffing intense pressure over its rebate . prime minister tony blair conceded that divisions remained wide , but insisted all sides realized the urgency of striking a deal , in particular to release money for poorer european union -lrb- eu -rrb- newcomer states . " we 're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it 's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation , " blair said after chairing a first round of discussions at a two-day summit thursday evening . " i think that everybody realizes that if we are going to do a deal on the budget , it 's now , " he noted . the iro n lady 's legacy the 2007-2013 budget is worth nearly 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.01 billion -rrb- and is vital to releasing much-needed funds to the relatively poor states from central and eastern europe which joined the bloc last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair is defending a deal secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 a deal is being held up by two key issues : britain 's refusal to part with its budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 , and french resistance to cutting back the union 's expensive farm subsidy system . failure to find a breakthrough would also deepen the sense of crisis over europe 's failure to get its painstakingly assembled constitution off the ground and could even threaten future enlargement . poland , along with france one of the most critical of the british proposal , including a substantial cutback in spending , said it expected blair to come up with a fresh offer in the morning . a log way to compromise " this new proposal is in the process of being worked upon and tomorrow it will be modified during bilateral meetings , " said polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , adding that talks were to resume friday morning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson gave the negotiations a 50-50 chance of success but participants warned much work remained to be done . " the gap is still very big because there was not a discussion on figures , that will start tomorrow , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
" there was a kind of tension , but it was not aggressiveness . " swedish prime minister göran persson said " huge differences " remained , estimating there was only a " 50-50 " chance of a deal . " the budget discussion was blunt , " persson said , but added : " every one of us realizes that if we do n't have a deal now it will not be easy next year . " a lasti n g revisio n ? thursday evening 's first session began with a 15-minute meeting between blair and his main rival , french president jacques chirac , as so often the two key players at the heart of the eu standoff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at loggerheads : french president jacques chirac , left , and british prime minister tony blair blair has already offered to surrender some 8 billion euros of britain 's rebate over the seven-year-budget term . but chirac is not only pushing for a bigger cut , but also " a lasting revision of the british rebate in terms of its mechanism and its amount , " his spokesman said . attention is focusing on a review clause in britain 's proposal : to revisit the budget at some time during the budget period , based on the recommendations of a report to be drawn up by barroso 's commission . the clause could see britain put its rebate up for more long-term review in exchange for a comprehensive reform of the spending package . " if we solve that , and i think it is possible to do , all other issues will be minor ones , " said persson . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu leaders press blair over budget standoff european union leaders pressed britain thursday to improve an offer to break the bloc 's budget deadlock , as they arrived for a crunch summit in brussels .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.12.2005 schäuble : facts obtained through torture should be used großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's interior minister is looking to expand his powers in the fight against terror german interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture to be used in court as he searches for greater powers in germany ’ s own " war on terror . " germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court as he searches for greater powers to prosecute germany 's own " war on terror . " schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday said it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper , as quoted by news magazine der spiegel .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .
zammar is a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states who was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 . " a few months in custody have already produced some information , " schäuble said .
" there are no signs to suggest that zammar has been tortured .
zammar has said to the bnd that he has been hit , however , not in syria , but in lebanon or somewhere else where he has been before , and not in connection with the examination . " schäuble added that the majority of the german people wanted their politicians to do all they could to keep them protected but that those with responsibility must pay attention to how far their efforts go .
politicians must not be allowed to be " unrestrained " in the quest for security . however , some germans have expressed outrage at the treatment of zammar and the conditions in which he is being kept in the notorious far-filastin prison , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters which human rights groups claim is a torture center .
when suspected crimes lead a person to be detained in such a facility , schäuble said that no-one could expect " a hotel room with a jacuzzi . " schäuble : terror trai n i n g should be pu n ishable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants anyone who undertook training in a terror camp to be punished schäuble also told the newspaper that he wanted to push the law to be more effective in the fight against terrorism .
he wants suspects where there is no firm evidence only suspicion to be allowed to be brought to court .
in addition , schäuble wanted " the graduation from an education in terrorism , from a camp in afghanistan or anywhere else " to be a punishable act from now on . the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . schäuble wa n ts bu n deswehr deployed at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the interior minister gets his way , bundeswehr troops will be deployed on home soil in terms of homeland security , the interior minister announced a basic law change that would allow the deployment of the german armed forces in a national capacity , with the 2006 world cup in mind .
in the coalition negotiations , this subject - along with air security proposals - had been left to the judgment of the federal constitutional court .
the judgment is expected in february . such deployment is currently only legal in exceptional circumstances and with the support of both houses of parliament .
germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a militarized police state . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble said .
" why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them . "
schäuble added that the armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd , " he said .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .

" we 're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it 's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation , " blair said after chairing a first round of discussions at a two-day summit thursday evening .

german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget . " we 'll find that out over the course of the day , " she told journalists as she arrived for a second day of talks in brussels .
" we will make every effort , but i can not at this moment say whether we will succeed or not .
the talks are in the truest sense of the word very difficult . " the eu was resuming last-ditch efforts friday to resolve its budget deadlock after a first evening of talks described as tense and blunt appeared to make little headway , with britain rebuffing intense pressure over its rebate . prime minister tony blair conceded that divisions remained wide , but insisted all sides realized the urgency of striking a deal , in particular to release money for poorer european union -lrb- eu -rrb- newcomer states . " we 're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it 's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation , " blair said after chairing a first round of discussions at a two-day summit thursday evening . " i think that everybody realizes that if we are going to do a deal on the budget , it 's now , " he noted . the iro n lady 's legacy the 2007-2013 budget is worth nearly 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.01 billion -rrb- and is vital to releasing much-needed funds to the relatively poor states from central and eastern europe which joined the bloc last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair is defending a deal secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 a deal is being held up by two key issues : britain 's refusal to part with its budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 , and french resistance to cutting back the union 's expensive farm subsidy system . failure to find a breakthrough would also deepen the sense of crisis over europe 's failure to get its painstakingly assembled constitution off the ground and could even threaten future enlargement . poland , along with france one of the most critical of the british proposal , including a substantial cutback in spending , said it expected blair to come up with a fresh offer in the morning . a log way to compromise " this new proposal is in the process of being worked upon and tomorrow it will be modified during bilateral meetings , " said polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , adding that talks were to resume friday morning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson gave the negotiations a 50-50 chance of success but participants warned much work remained to be done . " the gap is still very big because there was not a discussion on figures , that will start tomorrow , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .

but while supermodel-turned-host heidi klum and the soccer greats got to leave right after the show , blume stayed on to help clean things up . after the set design had been taken down , a few garbage containers were still standing around in leipzig 's convention center .
one of them attracted blume 's attention , as three blue bags with the logo of world soccer federation fifa were lying inside . blume opened the bags and found 32 pieces of orange paper that had played the leading role in the tv extravaganza .
written on them were the names of the soccer teams that will participate in the world cup next year and they had been used in the draw . " i could n't believe it - why would anyone throw these away , " blume told his local paper in the eastern german town of magdeburg . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german soccer team coach jürgen klinsmann -lrb- left -rrb- was pleased with the group germany ended up in not that blume himself seems too attached to them .
remembering how another young man made a fortune by selling a car previously owned by pope benedict xvi earlier this year , he decided to post the papers on online auction house ebay . he 's accepting bids until christmas and hopes to make 3,200 euros -lrb- $ 3,840 -rrb- .

written on them were the names of the soccer teams that will participate in the world cup next year and they had been used in the draw .

german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget . " we 'll find that out over the course of the day , " she told journalists as she arrived for a second day of talks in brussels .
" we will make every effort , but i can not at this moment say whether we will succeed or not .
the talks are in the truest sense of the word very difficult . " the eu was resuming last-ditch efforts friday to resolve its budget deadlock after a first evening of talks described as tense and blunt appeared to make little headway , with britain rebuffing intense pressure over its rebate . prime minister tony blair conceded that divisions remained wide , but insisted all sides realized the urgency of striking a deal , in particular to release money for poorer european union -lrb- eu -rrb- newcomer states . " we 're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it 's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation , " blair said after chairing a first round of discussions at a two-day summit thursday evening . " i think that everybody realizes that if we are going to do a deal on the budget , it 's now , " he noted . the iro n lady 's legacy the 2007-2013 budget is worth nearly 850 million euros -lrb- $ 1.01 billion -rrb- and is vital to releasing much-needed funds to the relatively poor states from central and eastern europe which joined the bloc last year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair is defending a deal secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 a deal is being held up by two key issues : britain 's refusal to part with its budget rebate , famously secured by margaret thatcher in 1984 , and french resistance to cutting back the union 's expensive farm subsidy system . failure to find a breakthrough would also deepen the sense of crisis over europe 's failure to get its painstakingly assembled constitution off the ground and could even threaten future enlargement . poland , along with france one of the most critical of the british proposal , including a substantial cutback in spending , said it expected blair to come up with a fresh offer in the morning . a log way to compromise " this new proposal is in the process of being worked upon and tomorrow it will be modified during bilateral meetings , " said polish prime minister kazimierz marcinkiewicz , adding that talks were to resume friday morning . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister göran persson gave the negotiations a 50-50 chance of success but participants warned much work remained to be done . " the gap is still very big because there was not a discussion on figures , that will start tomorrow , " said european commission chief jose manuel barroso .
" there was a kind of tension , but it was not aggressiveness . " swedish prime minister göran persson said " huge differences " remained , estimating there was only a " 50-50 " chance of a deal . " the budget discussion was blunt , " persson said , but added : " every one of us realizes that if we do n't have a deal now it will not be easy next year . " a lasti n g revisio n ? thursday evening 's first session began with a 15-minute meeting between blair and his main rival , french president jacques chirac , as so often the two key players at the heart of the eu standoff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at loggerheads : french president jacques chirac , left , and british prime minister tony blair blair has already offered to surrender some 8 billion euros of britain 's rebate over the seven-year-budget term . but chirac is not only pushing for a bigger cut , but also " a lasting revision of the british rebate in terms of its mechanism and its amount , " his spokesman said . attention is focusing on a review clause in britain 's proposal : to revisit the budget at some time during the budget period , based on the recommendations of a report to be drawn up by barroso 's commission . the clause could see britain put its rebate up for more long-term review in exchange for a comprehensive reform of the spending package .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .

" germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court as he searches for greater powers to prosecute germany 's own " war on terror . " schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday said it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper , as quoted by news magazine der spiegel .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .
zammar is a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states who was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 . " a few months in custody have already produced some information , " schäuble said .
" there are no signs to suggest that zammar has been tortured .
zammar has said to the bnd that he has been hit , however , not in syria , but in lebanon or somewhere else where he has been before , and not in connection with the examination . " schäuble added that the majority of the german people wanted their politicians to do all they could to keep them protected but that those with responsibility must pay attention to how far their efforts go .
politicians must not be allowed to be " unrestrained " in the quest for security . however , some germans have expressed outrage at the treatment of zammar and the conditions in which he is being kept in the notorious far-filastin prison , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters which human rights groups claim is a torture center .
when suspected crimes lead a person to be detained in such a facility , schäuble said that no-one could expect " a hotel room with a jacuzzi . " schäuble : terror trai n i n g should be pu n ishable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants anyone who undertook training in a terror camp to be punished schäuble also told the newspaper that he wanted to push the law to be more effective in the fight against terrorism .
he wants suspects where there is no firm evidence only suspicion to be allowed to be brought to court .
in addition , schäuble wanted " the graduation from an education in terrorism , from a camp in afghanistan or anywhere else " to be a punishable act from now on . the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . schäuble wa n ts bu n deswehr deployed at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the interior minister gets his way , bundeswehr troops will be deployed on home soil in terms of homeland security , the interior minister announced a basic law change that would allow the deployment of the german armed forces in a national capacity , with the 2006 world cup in mind .
in the coalition negotiations , this subject - along with air security proposals - had been left to the judgment of the federal constitutional court .
the judgment is expected in february . such deployment is currently only legal in exceptional circumstances and with the support of both houses of parliament .
germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a militarized police state . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble said .
" why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them . "
schäuble added that the armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd , " he said .

" germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court as he searches for greater powers to prosecute germany 's own " war on terror . " schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday said it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper , as quoted by news magazine der spiegel .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .
zammar is a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states who was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 . " a few months in custody have already produced some information , " schäuble said .
" there are no signs to suggest that zammar has been tortured .
zammar has said to the bnd that he has been hit , however , not in syria , but in lebanon or somewhere else where he has been before , and not in connection with the examination . " schäuble added that the majority of the german people wanted their politicians to do all they could to keep them protected but that those with responsibility must pay attention to how far their efforts go .
politicians must not be allowed to be " unrestrained " in the quest for security . however , some germans have expressed outrage at the treatment of zammar and the conditions in which he is being kept in the notorious far-filastin prison , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters which human rights groups claim is a torture center .
when suspected crimes lead a person to be detained in such a facility , schäuble said that no-one could expect " a hotel room with a jacuzzi . " schäuble : terror trai n i n g should be pu n ishable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants anyone who undertook training in a terror camp to be punished schäuble also told the newspaper that he wanted to push the law to be more effective in the fight against terrorism .
he wants suspects where there is no firm evidence only suspicion to be allowed to be brought to court .
in addition , schäuble wanted " the graduation from an education in terrorism , from a camp in afghanistan or anywhere else " to be a punishable act from now on . the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . schäuble wa n ts bu n deswehr deployed at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the interior minister gets his way , bundeswehr troops will be deployed on home soil in terms of homeland security , the interior minister announced a basic law change that would allow the deployment of the german armed forces in a national capacity , with the 2006 world cup in mind .
in the coalition negotiations , this subject - along with air security proposals - had been left to the judgment of the federal constitutional court .
the judgment is expected in february . such deployment is currently only legal in exceptional circumstances and with the support of both houses of parliament .
germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a militarized police state . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble said .
" why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them . "
schäuble added that the armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd , " he said .
" yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode .

" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .

politicians must not be allowed to be " unrestrained " in the quest for security . however , some germans have expressed outrage at the treatment of zammar and the conditions in which he is being kept in the notorious far-filastin prison , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters which human rights groups claim is a torture center .

schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .

" germany 's interior minister wolfgang schäuble wants information which may have been extracted from suspected terrorists through torture by a third party to be admissible in court as he searches for greater powers to prosecute germany 's own " war on terror . " schäuble told the süddeutsche zeitu n g in an interview published friday said it would be irresponsible not to use information obtained through torture to prosecute " dangerous persons " in a trial while maintaining that german security services themselves would " by no means " use torture during interrogations . " if we said that , under any circumstances , we should not use information where we can not be sure that it was attained under conditions completely in line with the rule of law , then this would be absolutely irresponsible , " schäuble told the paper , as quoted by news magazine der spiegel .
" we must use such information . " he stressed that the german security services were clear where the borders of a state under the rule of law were . " there can be no torture , " he said and added that even the suggestion of torture to extract statement from terror suspects would not be used by german agents . schäuble 's comments come as investigations gather pace all over europe into confidential cia flights and the existence of secret us military prisons on the continent where suspected terror suspects have been held and allegedly tortured . zammar 's dete n tio n i n syria beari n g fruit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mohammed zammar was transfered to damascus by the cia the minister of the interior also took the opportunity to once more justify the questioning of mohammed zammar by officials from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- in a syrian prison in which the use of torture is also suspected .
zammar is a german citizen and associate of the hamburg terror cell that led the sept .
11 attacks on the united states who was captured by the cia in morocco in 2001 . " a few months in custody have already produced some information , " schäuble said .
" there are no signs to suggest that zammar has been tortured .
zammar has said to the bnd that he has been hit , however , not in syria , but in lebanon or somewhere else where he has been before , and not in connection with the examination . " schäuble added that the majority of the german people wanted their politicians to do all they could to keep them protected but that those with responsibility must pay attention to how far their efforts go .
politicians must not be allowed to be " unrestrained " in the quest for security . however , some germans have expressed outrage at the treatment of zammar and the conditions in which he is being kept in the notorious far-filastin prison , a facility in the basement of the syrian military intelligence headquarters which human rights groups claim is a torture center .
when suspected crimes lead a person to be detained in such a facility , schäuble said that no-one could expect " a hotel room with a jacuzzi . " schäuble : terror trai n i n g should be pu n ishable bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants anyone who undertook training in a terror camp to be punished schäuble also told the newspaper that he wanted to push the law to be more effective in the fight against terrorism .
he wants suspects where there is no firm evidence only suspicion to be allowed to be brought to court .
in addition , schäuble wanted " the graduation from an education in terrorism , from a camp in afghanistan or anywhere else " to be a punishable act from now on . the conservative minister 's desire to take on tough new terror laws is seen to be the passing of the torch from his social democrat predecessor otto schily .
schily 's hard-line proposals , including preventive custody for terror suspects , had been rejected in the coalition negotiations .
but schäuble 's plans seem to elaborate on schily 's and push for penal custody of suspects . schily 's 2002 security package included laws making it illegal to be a member of a terror group .
schäuble 's looks to want to punish those who exhibit the behavioral patterns of members , even if no official allegiance is recognized . schäuble wa n ts bu n deswehr deployed at world cup bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if the interior minister gets his way , bundeswehr troops will be deployed on home soil in terms of homeland security , the interior minister announced a basic law change that would allow the deployment of the german armed forces in a national capacity , with the 2006 world cup in mind .
in the coalition negotiations , this subject - along with air security proposals - had been left to the judgment of the federal constitutional court .
the judgment is expected in february . such deployment is currently only legal in exceptional circumstances and with the support of both houses of parliament .
germany 's constitution , written in 1949 with the lessons of nazi rule in mind , establishes strict separation between police and military .
under the nazis , the line between the two became blurred , leading to a militarized police state . " during the world cup , for example , our federal and state police forces will be very stretched , " schäuble said .
" why should n't we transfer security services temporarily to the armed forces from the police to relieve them . "
schäuble added that the armed forces could be used to guard stadiums , airports and team quarters . " no one wants to see tanks in front of train stations or stadiums , this is completely absurd , " he said .
" yet you can imagine what would happen if somewhere a bomb in a back pack would explode .

german chancellor angela merkel said friday it was unclear whether eu leaders would be able to reach a deal at their summit here to break the deadlock over the bloc 's long-term budget . " we 'll find that out over the course of the day , " she told journalists as she arrived for a second day of talks in brussels .
" we will make every effort , but i can not at this moment say whether we will succeed or not .
the talks are in the truest sense of the word very difficult . " the eu was resuming last-ditch efforts friday to resolve its budget deadlock after a first evening of talks described as tense and blunt appeared to make little headway , with britain rebuffing intense pressure over its rebate . prime minister tony blair conceded that divisions remained wide , but insisted all sides realized the urgency of striking a deal , in particular to release money for poorer european union -lrb- eu -rrb- newcomer states . " we 're talking about very serious issues for a lot of countries and it 's going to be a difficult and tough negotiation , " blair said after chairing a first round of discussions at a two-day summit thursday evening .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2005 germany , eu condemn iran leader 's comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad 's words have caused outrage and his actions are raising fears recent outbursts against israel have brought iran international condemnation .
as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .
the aluminum tubing could , in principle , be used to adapt an existing missile into a multistage rocket capable of traveling up to 10,000 kilometers - which would put the united states in range . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .
editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react .

as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism .

" the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .

" the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .
the aluminum tubing could , in principle , be used to adapt an existing missile into a multistage rocket capable of traveling up to 10,000 kilometers - which would put the united states in range . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .

" the emerging direction of the meeting is worrying , " he said .
" in the main trade-boosting areas of the discussions , the level of ambition , if anything , is going backwards .
i do not want to contemplate a failure at hong kong .
but equally i see no point in an outcome here that simply locks in low ambitions , diminishes benefits for developing countries and falls short of our responsibilities to the global economy .
i would find it difficult to sign up to such a rolling-back of ambitions . " us trade officials meanwhile repeated their charge that it was the eu that had to move . " the whole round is being held hostage by the failure ... of our major interlocutor to come up with ambitious offers on agriculture , " a us official told reporters , without directly naming the eu . drive some further i n to poverty bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mandelson says the meeting 's direction is worrying the eu and us exchanges came amid growing frustration at the lack of progress in the doha round of talks which was launched in qatar in 2001 with the aim of freeing up global trade and specifically helping developing countries .
it is due to be completed by the end of 2006 . a major coalition of developing countries warned friday it would reject any deal that harmed their interests . " it appears that these talks will bring us nothing at all and even drive us further into poverty , " arvin boolel , mauritius ' minister of agriculture and chairman of the 56-member africa , caribbean and pacific group .
" this situation makes a mockery of the development agenda of this round .
we will not accept any agreement in hong kong that is made at our expense . " losi n g focus an australian official also expressed concern the meeting was losing focus . " there 's too much attention being paid to other issues but the fact remains that poor countries need access to wealthy markets - after all this is supposed to be a development round , " he told afp . the official said there was still a belief the hong kong conference could end on sunday with a positive outcome but he warned that it would take tough negotiation and more goodwill from all sides . the g20 and the cairns group of agricultural exporters , which australia leads , pressed the same point , urging the eu and the united states to budge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us trade representative rob portman is pressing for cuts in agriculture import tariffs " agriculture is at the center of this round and of the development dividends we seek from it , " the two groups said in a statement .
" those most responsible for such distortions must now face the difficult political decisions to move the round forward .
the dynamics of the negotiation require movements by both the eu and the usa .
it is time for them to display leadership . " the talks in hong kong were supposed to sign off on the framework for an overall accord , allowing the negotiations to conclude next year on time , but now the most that is hoped for is some deal to help the poorest countries . while the united states is pressing for a 55-90 percent cut in agricultural import tariffs , the european union has offered reductions in a range of 35 to 60 percent . on farm support , washington has said it is prepared to cut trade-distorting subsidies by 60 percent over five years , matched by an eu offer to make a 70 percent reduction in such assistance . dw staff / afp -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de latin americans slam eu banana policy at wto conference latin american nations on wednesday called on a world trade organization conference to condemn the european union 's new tariff plan for bananas , saying it flies in the face of the rules of global commerce .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2005 germany , eu condemn iran leader 's comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad 's words have caused outrage and his actions are raising fears recent outbursts against israel have brought iran international condemnation .
as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .
the aluminum tubing could , in principle , be used to adapt an existing missile into a multistage rocket capable of traveling up to 10,000 kilometers - which would put the united states in range . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .
editorialists also put forward their views on how germany and west should react .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.12.2005 germany , eu condemn iran leader 's comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ahmadinejad 's words have caused outrage and his actions are raising fears recent outbursts against israel have brought iran international condemnation .
as the eu tries to save increasingly difficult nuclear discussions with tehran , worrying reports of iran 's missile capability are published . the german parliament unanimously adopted a resolution friday condemning iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's latest outburst against israel while urging german leaders to keep up the pressure on the islamic state . " the comments were completely unacceptable , " read the motion adopted by lawmakers . parliamentarians also asked the government to " counter any policy that disputes israel 's right to existence " and called for the un to condemn the remarks . " those comments make a mockery of the six million victims of the holocaust , " said social democratic party spokesman christoph strässer . the move follows a similar motion by the european union friday , slamming the iranian president comments and warning tehran over its nuclear program , in draft summit conclusions . " the eu condemns unreservedly president ahmadinejad 's call for the eradication of israel and his denial of the holocaust , " said the conclusions , which were due to be adopted later friday .
" the comments are wholly unacceptable and have no place in a civilized political debate . " unleashed a wave of condemnation ahmadinejad unleashed a wave of condemnation from world leaders this week after he described the holocaust as a myth and called for the state of israel to be moved as far away as alaska .
the eu leaders urged tehran to " join the international consensus on the need of a two state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the european council is talking tougher as events become more grave they also called for iran " to support the search for peace between israel and its neighbors and to end the support for groups which advocate or engage in acts of terrorism . " those remarks , which come after similar comments in recent months , have stoked growing alarm in europe and added to concerns about iran 's nuclear ambitions . eu warns diplomatic window will not always be open amid a long-running standoff with tehran over its nuclear program , eu leaders warned time was running out for a diplomatic solution . " the european council is gravely concerned at iran 's failure to build confidence that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful , " they said in conclusions of their summit focused primarily on the bloc 's budget .
" while the eu continues to work for a diplomatic solution , the window of opportunity will not remain open indefinitely . " the statement comes ahead of an eu-iran meeting next wednesday in vienna , but european and western diplomats say there is little hope of progress in getting tehran to abandon nuclear fuel work that raises concerns it seeks to make nuclear weapons . the vienna-based un watchdog international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- has found iran in non-compliance with the non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- for almost two decades of hidden nuclear activities , a finding that requires eventual referral to the security council , which can impose sanctions . the iaea in november put off taking iran to the council after britain , france and germany - which have been leading the european diplomatic effort - agreed to give more time for new russian diplomacy to work . iran says program is peaceful but reports suggest otherwise iran insists its nuclear program is a peaceful effort to generate electricity and that it therefore has the right to enrich uranium on its territory .
enrichment makes what can be fuel for nuclear power reactors but also the raw material for atom bombs . the concerns over iran 's objectives will not be eased by a report in the german newspaper bild on friday which quotes a report from germany 's federal intelligence service -lrb- bnd -rrb- stating that iran has bought 18 mid-range rocket delivery systems from north korea . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new and modified rockets could pose a threat to iran 's neighbors and international rivals it was widely known that tehran possessed the shehab-3 rockets with a range of 1,300 kilometers but the report suggest that the bm-25 missiles , with a range of 2,500 , when combined with existing russian technology the iranians own , could reach a range of 3,500 kilometers .
this is almost the distance from tehran to berlin . missiles could threaten europe , israel , even us the missiles could also be armed with nuclear warheads and would be more than capable of reaching israel and parts of central europe . according to the bild report , the bnd already suspects that iranian experts are working towards adapting missiles to carry atomic payloads .
the article stated that german agents have identified a site at tabriz , 600 kilometers northwest from tehran where work was being carried out on testing silo-based rockets . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the development of long range missiles could further destabilize the region combined with news that a delivery of rocket components on its way to iran from china was intercepted recently causes even more concern .
the aluminum tubing could , in principle , be used to adapt an existing missile into a multistage rocket capable of traveling up to 10,000 kilometers - which would put the united states in range . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda , jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german press review : lighting the middle east 's powder keg the german press was fuming over iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad 's repeated attacks against israel and denial of the holocaust .

with the festive season in full swing , police and trading standards officers are determined not to let underage alcohol sales spiral out of control .
they are carrying out a number of undercover stings on off-licences , corner shops and supermarkets across the county using a teenager as bait to see if any of them will sell alcohol .
two trading standards officers , chris and tim , and police licensing officer karen o 'donnell are all in plain clothes when they meet for the briefing at weymouth police station .
fifteen-year-old kate is also there .
she is one of trading standards most experienced volunteers as she has been doing undercover work for about a year .
she says she really enjoys it and sometimes jokingly calls herself a " secret agent " .
before wednesday night 's operations can get under way she is photographed and measured to make sure she " looks like your typical teenager " .
ivan hancock , divisional trading standards manager , is accompanying the team on the sting and explains : " this will help if the case has to go to court and means the volunteer wo n't have to be called as a witness . "
" it 's important that they do n't look older than they are , it needs to be realistic . "
the first target is a supermarket on the outskirts of weymouth .
kate walks in on her own while the officers keep watch , pretending to look through magazines or buying a bar of chocolate .
but they have to make sure they stay close to her to overhear any conversation with the sales assistant .
this one is a sale straight away - no questions asked .
kate walks out with four cans of lager and the team gathers by the car to seal the evidence in a clear bag .
kate comes across as a typical teenager , giggles a lot and says she gets a bit nervous before she walks into the shop .
" i do get really nervous , especially in the beginning , but i 'm glad we got a sale in the first supermarket because they -lsb- supermarkets -rsb- are my worst . "
all the details of the sale and the name of the sales assistant are logged and the officers discuss what action is to be taken .
karen decides to return the next day to issue a fixed penalty of £ 80 .
under new laws that came into force a year ago police can issue on-the-spot fines in those cases where it is felt the staff has had adequate training but still went on to sell alcohol to the teenagers .
" if that 's the case it will be the sales assistant who receives the fine , " she says .
" there are sometimes when you just think ' please , please do n't sell cause i do n't want to have to do this to this person ' . "
trading standards officer chris legg , who has been on a number of undercover stings in the past , admits he sometimes feel " guilty " .
" we 've had some shops in the past where staff have been sacked because they 've sold and you start to feel a bit guilty , but then you think if a 15-year-old gets alcohol and ends up in the road and gets killed . "
the team then moves on to the next targets , a couple of off-licences , and two corner shops , but there are no more sales on this night .
the last shop where kate attempts to buy a bottle of cider is londis on abbotsbury road , but she is turned down .
julie haazen , store supervisor , is surprised when she finds out .
" i had no idea , " she says .
" i think it 's a good thing to be checked .
obviously mistakes do happen but we are quite strict here . "
she said they do get a lot of youngsters trying to buy alcohol and " they come up with all kinds of excuses " .
" sometimes i just laugh in their faces , " ms haazen added .

with the festive season in full swing , police and trading standards officers are determined not to let underage alcohol sales spiral out of control .
they are carrying out a number of undercover stings on off-licences , corner shops and supermarkets across the county using a teenager as bait to see if any of them will sell alcohol .
two trading standards officers , chris and tim , and police licensing officer karen o 'donnell are all in plain clothes when they meet for the briefing at weymouth police station .
fifteen-year-old kate is also there .
she is one of trading standards most experienced volunteers as she has been doing undercover work for about a year .
she says she really enjoys it and sometimes jokingly calls herself a " secret agent " .
chris waits on the corner near the shop being targeted before wednesday night 's operations can get under way she is photographed and measured to make sure she " looks like your typical teenager " .
ivan hancock , divisional trading standards manager , is accompanying the team on the sting and explains : " this will help if the case has to go to court and means the volunteer wo n't have to be called as a witness . "
" it 's important that they do n't look older than they are , it needs to be realistic . "
the first target is a supermarket on the outskirts of weymouth .
kate walks in on her own while the officers keep watch , pretending to look through magazines or buying a bar of chocolate .
but they have to make sure they stay close to her to overhear any conversation with the sales assistant .
this one is a sale straight away - no questions asked .
chris talks to staff at one of the shops that refused a sale kate walks out with four cans of lager and the team gathers by the car to seal the evidence in a clear bag .
kate comes across as a typical teenager , giggles a lot and says she gets a bit nervous before she walks into the shop .
" i do get really nervous , especially in the beginning , but i 'm glad we got a sale in the first supermarket because they -lsb- supermarkets -rsb- are my worst . "
all the details of the sale and the name of the sales assistant are logged and the officers discuss what action is to be taken .
karen decides to return the next day to issue a fixed penalty of £ 80 .
under new laws that came into force a year ago police can issue on-the-spot fines in those cases where it is felt the staff has had adequate training but still went on to sell alcohol to the teenagers .
" if that 's the case it will be the sales assistant who receives the fine , " she says .
" there are sometimes when you just think ' please , please do n't sell cause i do n't want to have to do this to this person ' . "
all details have to be recorded in case they are needed as evidence trading standards officer chris legg , who has been on a number of undercover stings in the past , admits he sometimes feel " guilty " .
" we 've had some shops in the past where staff have been sacked because they 've sold and you start to feel a bit guilty , but then you think if a 15-year-old gets alcohol and ends up in the road and gets killed . "
the team then moves on to the next targets , a couple of off-licences , and two corner shops , but there are no more sales on this night .
the last shop where kate attempts to buy a bottle of cider is londis on abbotsbury road , but she is turned down .
julie haazen , store supervisor , is surprised when she finds out .
" i had no idea , " she says .
" i think it 's a good thing to be checked .
obviously mistakes do happen but we are quite strict here . "
she said they do get a lot of youngsters trying to buy alcohol and " they come up with all kinds of excuses " .

if the plans are given the go-ahead , the casino development would prompt early large scale investment into the £ 700m sports village , the council said .
the authority warned that if the casino plan was turned down , the sports plans would be delayed beyond their deadline of 2012 .
it also wants a change to the rule that one region can have only one casino . "
we accept that problem gambling does exist , but as a responsible operator we want to offer people with problems the appropriate help . "
arthur pitcher , aspers marketing manager currently the gambling act only allows for one regional casino , but cardiff , along with other authorities , is calling for that to change .
council leader rodney berman said the council needed to prove to the government that a regional casino would provide economic regeneration and major investment .
he said the council also had to show that any " adverse social effects identified are minimised , controlled and managed . "
" in this way we will realise the international sports village as a world-class sporting and leisure facility and firmly put cardiff on the winner 's podium as a city of truly international standing whilst supporting the uk 's ability to successfully host the olympics of 2012 . "
the uk / australian firm aspers has been named by the council as its preferred operator of the casino , and it is claimed it would create 1,500 new jobs .
new jobs ahead of the decision , a community action for responsible gaming -lrb- carg -rrb- group has been set up by aspers .
the voluntary group , made up of church representatives and other organisations as well as the police and council , will gauge local opinion , say aspers .
arthur pitcher , aspers marketing manager , chaired the first meeting of cardiff carg - community action for responsible gaming he said : " aspers is proud to launch a carg in cardiff .
" as a casino operator of more than 40 years ' standing , with casinos in france , new zealand and australia , we accept that problem gambling does exist , but as a responsible operator we want to offer people with problems the appropriate help .
" carg will be one means of tackling these problems . "
" we will also oversee research on gambling trends in the community and help to develop responsible gambling education materials and information .
" aspers will be a leisure destination not solely for gambling - customers will be able to come and spend the whole evening at aspers and not gamble , " he added .
other plans for the sports village include 50-metre swimming pools , spas and leisure facilities and a 4,000-seat multi-purpose arena .
hotels , bars and restaurants are also envisaged to support international athletes for the 2012 olympics .
work on cardiff bay 's sports village started in autumn after outline planning permission was granted in 2003 .
uk culture secretary tessa jowell will specify areas in england , wales and scotland for a " super-casino " and 16 other smaller ones by 2007 .

in 1999 cornwall was granted objective one status , entitling the county to more than £ 300m in european grants .
the scheme ends next year and cornwall is expected to benefit from a new scheme from 2007 .
but that depends on a successful outcome to the talks in brussels on the new eu budget .
funding available prime minister tony blair 's proposals have already been rejected once by the other nations .
if they can not reach agreement , the budget talks will be postponed until next year , under the presidency of austria .
the austrians could have different ideas about spending priorities , which would mean uncertainty about the amount money cornwall could receive in the future and a delay in getting it .
councillor andrew mitchell , who holds the economy portfolio on the county council , told the bbc he still had reservations about the uk government 's attitude to cornwall even if the budget is agreed .
however , if the eu talks fail , then the budget agreement could stretch for up to 12 months , which could prove problematic for development bodies in the county .
the objective one programme makes about £ 100m of european funding available to the county a year .
the current round of cash available is due to finish at the end of 2006 .

controllers have lost contact with the troubled craft and are unable to command it to begin the journey home .
the hayabusa probe should have left asteroid itokawa this month carrying dust samples for return in 2007 .
but the japan aerospace exploration agency -lrb- jaxa -rrb- announced last week that a landmark attempt to collect rock material had probably failed .
in the latest setback , it said it would take about a year to restore hayabusa 's faulty control system , forcing its return to be postponed .
the dynamics of the solar system mean that travelling back to earth from the asteroid will not be practical again for three years .
hayabusa is currently stationed at itokawa about 290 million km -lrb- 180 million miles -rrb- from earth .
controllers have lost radio contact with their quarry and are unable to control its direction .
the problems are believed to stem from a fuel leak in some of hayabusa 's 12 engines , which have all since stopped working .
" this is disappointing , but we 'll spend the coming year -lsb- trying -rsb- to rescue the craft and retrieve it in june 2010 , if we can control it again by the beginning of 2007 , " project manager junichiro kawaguchi said at a press conference .
" there is a good possibility that the craft can be controlled again , " he added .
the original plan was for hayabusa to approach earth and drop a capsule containing samples of asteroid dust into the australian outback in june 2007 .
but although hayabusa apparently landed on the asteroid twice , it failed to fire a metal bullet designed to gather rock samples .
team members are clinging to the hope that hayabusa could have disturbed enough dust for some to have found its way into the sample collection chamber by chance .

the move follows the successful completion of a partial face transplant by a team in france .
what did the french team do ?
they have transplanted skin from a donor on to a 36-year-old woman 's face .
the new tissue covers her nose , lips and chin - which were all damaged when she was attacked by a dog in january this year .
the operation involves connecting many small blood vessels from the donated tissue to the patient 's face .
has it been tried before ?
the procedure has not been tried on a living human before .
however , a plastic surgeon in the us says he has transplanted the face of one dead person onto another dead person and scientists have successfully carried out face transplants on animals , namely rats and dogs .
surgeons in india have successfully replanted the face of one patient .
however , normal appearance was affected and muscles were damaged .
what other work is going on around the world ?
surgeons in cleveland , us , announced in september that they planned to interview prospective patients for a face transplant .
in addition , a team led by dr peter butler from the royal free hospital in london and another us team in kentucky are carrying out research .
what do the uk team plan ?
dr butler , who has been researching the process for 10 years , hopes to work on a patient who has had severe facial burns or facial trauma and who is likely to have already had skin grafts .
during surgery , one team will remove skin grafts and any other reconstructive surgery from the face of the patient , and a second team will remove the face from the donor .
they will only take the skin and the underlying fat and blood vessels .
the face will then be kept on ice for transport to the patient , and stitched into place in a delicate procedure expected to take 14 hours .
what are the medical concerns ?
as there have been no human trials of this procedure in live patients , nobody really knows what the long-term effects would be .
experts have warned there is a real risk that the procedure will not work .
in the short term , clots could form in the donated tissue .
and , in the longer term , the immunosuppressants may fail .
the risks of rejection are relatively high .
senior surgeons estimate one in 10 patients could suffer rejection within six weeks .
up to half could suffer chronic rejection after a year .
taking immunosuppressants also increase a person 's cancer risk , so anyone who considering a face transplant would have to decide whether the benefits outweighed the risks .
and what about the ethical worries ?
the second major factor is the psychological effects - both on the patient and on the donor 's family .
there are doubts that families would consent to have the face of their loved one removed and transplanted onto someone else .
if they did give permission , how would these families react if they were to meet or see the patient ?
for their part , the patient would have to come to terms with the fact that they do not look the way they did before .
they would also have to be comfortable wearing someone else 's face .
this can not be taken for granted .
the man who received the world 's first hand transplant asked for it to be removed , partly because he did n't like having somebody else 's hand .
what would the patient look like ?
they would not have the same skeleton and facial shape as the donor , so they would not look like them .
but neither would they look as they did before .
computer simulations have shown that donor families would not recognise the face on a recipient .

last month it emerged that obese people would not be entitled to such surgery on the nhs in east suffolk .
the ruling was made by three primary care trusts in an attempt to save cash .
nicholas finer , a consultant in obesity medicine at addenbrooke 's hospital in cambridge , said there was no evidence that their replacement joints wore out .
some experts say that the risks of operating on obese patients are higher and the treatment may be less effective , with replacement joints wearing out sooner .
' prejudice ' but dr finer , writing in the british medical journal , said : " no evidence supports withholding joint replacement from obese people , even on utilitarian grounds .
" since obesity does not increase the risks or diminish the benefits of joint replacement , the trust 's decision to deny such treatment seems to be based on prejudice or attribution of fault , or both . "
dr brian keeble , director of public health for ipswich pct , has said operating in such cases could be detrimental to patients because of the risk of side effects .
he also blamed the " pressing financial problems " of the nhs in east suffolk for the move .

lord lovat led his commandos ashore to the skirl of the bagpipes and asked piper millin , then aged 21 , to play to rally the troops ' morale .
later the germans claimed they did not shoot him because they thought he must be " mad " .
lord lovat 's men went on to fight their way to pegasus bridge where they met the 6th airborne division .
mr millin , whose actions have already inspired books and paintings , said he was " very honoured " to now be celebrated in ms allen 's song .
