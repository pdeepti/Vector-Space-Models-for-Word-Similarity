program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 02.10.2005 the european legacy of the fall of the wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification has proven to be tougher than many expected german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .
after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

18 elections , leaving germany in political deadlock .
merkel 's christian democrats and their bavarian sister partner won just three seats more in the bundestag lower house of parliament than schröder 's social democrats , far short of a governing majority . although the dresden poll can not significantly alter the preliminary sept .
18 result , germans are hoping the official end of the election with the vote in dresden will produce a breakthrough in the bitter power struggle over who will be the next chancellor . bildunterschrift : it is looking increasingly likely that the two main parties will form a so-called grand coalition to govern the country .
talks between the two sides are still in the exploratory phase and they have not settled the burning question of who will become chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . bargaining bluff ? schröder 's stance is seen by many as a bargaining bluff in the coalition talks , and there have been suggestions from the conservatives that he would bow out after the dresden vote . the social democrats have dismissed the claims and an announcement by schröder 's office that he will visit spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on wednesday , suggested he intends to still be head of government at that point . in the last election in 2002 , voters in the dresden district elected a christian democrat by a narrow margin . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , merkel in final campaign battle as coalition talks continued , chancellor gerhard schröder and rival angela merkel hit the campaign trail one last time ahead of sunday 's delayed vote in dresden , attacking each other as unqualified to lead the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2005 foreign books dominate german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign fiction gives germans a wider cultural experience germans tend to fancy foreign literature over their own - seeking more diverse and light-hearted reading , but small declines in foreign dominance may indicate a growing interest in germany 's up-and-coming writers . on a busy weekday evening at bonn 's bouvier bookstore , customers perusing the fiction shelves were gravitating to foreign selections .
gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .

the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "
investing in new german talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students of the german literature institute in leipzig have hit the market with a new literary style in the fiction market , there were 5 percent fewer english titles released in 2004 compared with 2000 - a development that may also be explained by a growing interest in promoting promising young german authors .
" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .

" ratzinger is seen at the vatican as one of the staunchest opponents of communism , " a stasi spy noted in his file after the late john paul ii named ratzinger prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
the report said the stasi also attempted in vain to unearth damaging documents from ratzinger 's involvement in the hitler youth under the third reich .
pope said to have approved publication an " unofficial collaborator " for the regime using the alias " birke " -lrb- birch -rrb- reported on lectures ratzinger gave at a seminary in the eastern city of erfurt and recognized his importance to the roman catholic church .
" ratzinger is currently , after the pope and secretary of state -lrb- agostino -rrb- casaroli , the most influential political and leading ideologue at the vatican , " a stasi spy wrote in the 1980s .
a spokesman for the stasi archive confirmed on sunday that the east german secret police had indeed spied on ratzinger , according to news agency dpa .
" the stasi appears to have very systematically collected information about ratzinger and his political situation within the church during particular points in his career , " the spokesman said . at least eight stasi spies tracked ratzinger over the years , although only two have been identified . bild am sonntag said the pope personally approved the release of his stasi file . ratzinger was born in the southern german town of marktl am inn in 1927 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most famous non-voter germans eligible to vote headed to the polls sunday .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .

initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .

the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .

germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

18 elections , leaving germany in political deadlock .
merkel 's christian democrats and their bavarian sister partner won just three seats more in the bundestag lower house of parliament than schröder 's social democrats , far short of a governing majority . although the dresden poll can not significantly alter the preliminary sept .
18 result , germans are hoping the official end of the election with the vote in dresden will produce a breakthrough in the bitter power struggle over who will be the next chancellor . bildunterschrift : it is looking increasingly likely that the two main parties will form a so-called grand coalition to govern the country .
talks between the two sides are still in the exploratory phase and they have not settled the burning question of who will become chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . bargaining bluff ? schröder 's stance is seen by many as a bargaining bluff in the coalition talks , and there have been suggestions from the conservatives that he would bow out after the dresden vote . the social democrats have dismissed the claims and an announcement by schröder 's office that he will visit spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on wednesday , suggested he intends to still be head of government at that point . in the last election in 2002 , voters in the dresden district elected a christian democrat by a narrow margin . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , merkel in final campaign battle as coalition talks continued , chancellor gerhard schröder and rival angela merkel hit the campaign trail one last time ahead of sunday 's delayed vote in dresden , attacking each other as unqualified to lead the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 02.10.2005 the european legacy of the fall of the wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification has proven to be tougher than many expected german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .
after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2005 foreign books dominate german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign fiction gives germans a wider cultural experience germans tend to fancy foreign literature over their own - seeking more diverse and light-hearted reading , but small declines in foreign dominance may indicate a growing interest in germany 's up-and-coming writers . on a busy weekday evening at bonn 's bouvier bookstore , customers perusing the fiction shelves were gravitating to foreign selections .
gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "
investing in new german talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students of the german literature institute in leipzig have hit the market with a new literary style in the fiction market , there were 5 percent fewer english titles released in 2004 compared with 2000 - a development that may also be explained by a growing interest in promoting promising young german authors .
" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .
while that may be good news for german literature 's stake in the market , foreign titles are not likely to lose their place on the bestseller lists . megan harris , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

18 elections , leaving germany in political deadlock .
merkel 's christian democrats and their bavarian sister partner won just three seats more in the bundestag lower house of parliament than schröder 's social democrats , far short of a governing majority . although the dresden poll can not significantly alter the preliminary sept .
18 result , germans are hoping the official end of the election with the vote in dresden will produce a breakthrough in the bitter power struggle over who will be the next chancellor . bildunterschrift : it is looking increasingly likely that the two main parties will form a so-called grand coalition to govern the country .
talks between the two sides are still in the exploratory phase and they have not settled the burning question of who will become chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . bargaining bluff ? schröder 's stance is seen by many as a bargaining bluff in the coalition talks , and there have been suggestions from the conservatives that he would bow out after the dresden vote . the social democrats have dismissed the claims and an announcement by schröder 's office that he will visit spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on wednesday , suggested he intends to still be head of government at that point . in the last election in 2002 , voters in the dresden district elected a christian democrat by a narrow margin . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , merkel in final campaign battle as coalition talks continued , chancellor gerhard schröder and rival angela merkel hit the campaign trail one last time ahead of sunday 's delayed vote in dresden , attacking each other as unqualified to lead the country .

" ratzinger is seen at the vatican as one of the staunchest opponents of communism , " a stasi spy noted in his file after the late john paul ii named ratzinger prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
the report said the stasi also attempted in vain to unearth damaging documents from ratzinger 's involvement in the hitler youth under the third reich .
pope said to have approved publication an " unofficial collaborator " for the regime using the alias " birke " -lrb- birch -rrb- reported on lectures ratzinger gave at a seminary in the eastern city of erfurt and recognized his importance to the roman catholic church .
" ratzinger is currently , after the pope and secretary of state -lrb- agostino -rrb- casaroli , the most influential political and leading ideologue at the vatican , " a stasi spy wrote in the 1980s .
a spokesman for the stasi archive confirmed on sunday that the east german secret police had indeed spied on ratzinger , according to news agency dpa .
" the stasi appears to have very systematically collected information about ratzinger and his political situation within the church during particular points in his career , " the spokesman said . at least eight stasi spies tracked ratzinger over the years , although only two have been identified . bild am sonntag said the pope personally approved the release of his stasi file . ratzinger was born in the southern german town of marktl am inn in 1927 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most famous non-voter germans eligible to vote headed to the polls sunday .

" the picture ... will be very telling , not just for the future of turkey but also for that of the eu , " recep tayyip erdogan said at a conference of his justice and development party in the northwestern spa resort of kizilcahamam . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player , which would show its political maturity , or it will limit itself to a christian club , " erdogan added , in an address broadcast by the cnn turkey tv station .
the prime minister described the decision on opening formal accession talks as a " test " of the bloc 's commitment to the values of pluralism and democracy . eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday night in an 11th hour bid to agree a negotiating framework , which has so far been blocked by austria 's objection to full membership for turkey .
vienna favors the alternative of a " privileged partnership " with turkey , an option rejected by ankara , which threatened this week to not attend monday 's negotiations if such a plan was on the table . straw : key moment in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw speaks to reporters gathered in luxembourg british foreign secretary jack straw , arriving for the emergency meeting , warned that the 25-member bloc stands at a key moment in its history as it prepares to start membership talks with turkey . " this is a crucial meeting for the future of the european union , " he said , underlining that failure to start the talks " would represent a failure for the european union . "
eu foreign policy chief javier solana voiced optimism about the talks .
" i think we will find a deal tonight , " he said . but france 's foreign minister said that the starting of talks does n't guarantee eventual membership .
many top french politicians favor the " privileged partnership " option . " to make believe that negotiations mean entry , that 's a lie , philippe douste-blazy said in a radio and television interview . now or never bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish foreign minister abdullah gül warned sunday that turkey was unlikely to reopen membership negotiations if official entry talks did not begin as scheduled on monday . " i can not see them happening again , " he said in an interview with the yeni safak newspaper .
saying that he considered oct .
3 as nothing more than an " implementation date " for decisions already taken by the bloc in december , gül reiterated that turkey was not prepared to " begin negotiations whatever the price . " the bloc approved monday 's planned accession talks on dec .
17 , providing that turkey implemented certain legal reforms and broadened a customs union to take in 10 new member states , including the disputed island of cyprus . turkey has met these obligations , although concerns were raised at the european parliament in strasbourg last week over ankara 's refusal to let cypriot ships and planes use its ports and airports , as required by the customs deal .
relations with the bloc have also been strained by turkey 's declaration in july reaffirming its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus and by ankara 's refusal to recognize a genocide " against armenians under the ottoman empire during the first world war , a highly sensitive issue for turkey . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 02.10.2005 the european legacy of the fall of the wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification has proven to be tougher than many expected german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .
after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

" the picture ... will be very telling , not just for the future of turkey but also for that of the eu , " recep tayyip erdogan said at a conference of his justice and development party in the northwestern spa resort of kizilcahamam . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player , which would show its political maturity , or it will limit itself to a christian club , " erdogan added , in an address broadcast by the cnn turkey tv station .
the prime minister described the decision on opening formal accession talks as a " test " of the bloc 's commitment to the values of pluralism and democracy . eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday night in an 11th hour bid to agree a negotiating framework , which has so far been blocked by austria 's objection to full membership for turkey .
vienna favors the alternative of a " privileged partnership " with turkey , an option rejected by ankara , which threatened this week to not attend monday 's negotiations if such a plan was on the table . straw : key moment in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw speaks to reporters gathered in luxembourg british foreign secretary jack straw , arriving for the emergency meeting , warned that the 25-member bloc stands at a key moment in its history as it prepares to start membership talks with turkey . " this is a crucial meeting for the future of the european union , " he said , underlining that failure to start the talks " would represent a failure for the european union . "
eu foreign policy chief javier solana voiced optimism about the talks .
" i think we will find a deal tonight , " he said . but france 's foreign minister said that the starting of talks does n't guarantee eventual membership .
many top french politicians favor the " privileged partnership " option . " to make believe that negotiations mean entry , that 's a lie , philippe douste-blazy said in a radio and television interview . now or never bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish foreign minister abdullah gül warned sunday that turkey was unlikely to reopen membership negotiations if official entry talks did not begin as scheduled on monday . " i can not see them happening again , " he said in an interview with the yeni safak newspaper .
saying that he considered oct .
3 as nothing more than an " implementation date " for decisions already taken by the bloc in december , gül reiterated that turkey was not prepared to " begin negotiations whatever the price . " the bloc approved monday 's planned accession talks on dec .
17 , providing that turkey implemented certain legal reforms and broadened a customs union to take in 10 new member states , including the disputed island of cyprus . turkey has met these obligations , although concerns were raised at the european parliament in strasbourg last week over ankara 's refusal to let cypriot ships and planes use its ports and airports , as required by the customs deal .
relations with the bloc have also been strained by turkey 's declaration in july reaffirming its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus and by ankara 's refusal to recognize a genocide " against armenians under the ottoman empire during the first world war , a highly sensitive issue for turkey . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .

in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .

" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "

" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .

dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 02.10.2005 the european legacy of the fall of the wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification has proven to be tougher than many expected german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .
after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .

today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .

though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .

eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .

today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet .

eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .

today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .

martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .

" over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .

the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .
he 'd like the opportunity to go on vacation again . christian werner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german east accused of misappropriation next week , east german states are required to tell finance minister hans eichel how they spent the billions of euros in subsidies the federal government transferred last year .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .

the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2005 foreign books dominate german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign fiction gives germans a wider cultural experience germans tend to fancy foreign literature over their own - seeking more diverse and light-hearted reading , but small declines in foreign dominance may indicate a growing interest in germany 's up-and-coming writers . on a busy weekday evening at bonn 's bouvier bookstore , customers perusing the fiction shelves were gravitating to foreign selections .
gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "
investing in new german talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students of the german literature institute in leipzig have hit the market with a new literary style in the fiction market , there were 5 percent fewer english titles released in 2004 compared with 2000 - a development that may also be explained by a growing interest in promoting promising young german authors .
" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .
while that may be good news for german literature 's stake in the market , foreign titles are not likely to lose their place on the bestseller lists . megan harris , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .
he 'd like the opportunity to go on vacation again . christian werner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german east accused of misappropriation next week , east german states are required to tell finance minister hans eichel how they spent the billions of euros in subsidies the federal government transferred last year .

gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .

" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "

" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2005 foreign books dominate german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign fiction gives germans a wider cultural experience germans tend to fancy foreign literature over their own - seeking more diverse and light-hearted reading , but small declines in foreign dominance may indicate a growing interest in germany 's up-and-coming writers . on a busy weekday evening at bonn 's bouvier bookstore , customers perusing the fiction shelves were gravitating to foreign selections .
gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "
investing in new german talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students of the german literature institute in leipzig have hit the market with a new literary style in the fiction market , there were 5 percent fewer english titles released in 2004 compared with 2000 - a development that may also be explained by a growing interest in promoting promising young german authors .
" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .
while that may be good news for german literature 's stake in the market , foreign titles are not likely to lose their place on the bestseller lists . megan harris , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .

18 elections , leaving germany in political deadlock .
merkel 's christian democrats and their bavarian sister partner won just three seats more in the bundestag lower house of parliament than schröder 's social democrats , far short of a governing majority . although the dresden poll can not significantly alter the preliminary sept .
18 result , germans are hoping the official end of the election with the vote in dresden will produce a breakthrough in the bitter power struggle over who will be the next chancellor . bildunterschrift : it is looking increasingly likely that the two main parties will form a so-called grand coalition to govern the country .
talks between the two sides are still in the exploratory phase and they have not settled the burning question of who will become chancellor .
schröder claims he still has a mandate for a third term as chancellor , but merkel said her alliance won the election and therefore she should govern . bargaining bluff ? schröder 's stance is seen by many as a bargaining bluff in the coalition talks , and there have been suggestions from the conservatives that he would bow out after the dresden vote . the social democrats have dismissed the claims and an announcement by schröder 's office that he will visit spanish prime minister jose luis rodriguez zapatero on wednesday , suggested he intends to still be head of government at that point . in the last election in 2002 , voters in the dresden district elected a christian democrat by a narrow margin . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , merkel in final campaign battle as coalition talks continued , chancellor gerhard schröder and rival angela merkel hit the campaign trail one last time ahead of sunday 's delayed vote in dresden , attacking each other as unqualified to lead the country .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2005 foreign books dominate german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign fiction gives germans a wider cultural experience germans tend to fancy foreign literature over their own - seeking more diverse and light-hearted reading , but small declines in foreign dominance may indicate a growing interest in germany 's up-and-coming writers . on a busy weekday evening at bonn 's bouvier bookstore , customers perusing the fiction shelves were gravitating to foreign selections .
gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "
investing in new german talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students of the german literature institute in leipzig have hit the market with a new literary style in the fiction market , there were 5 percent fewer english titles released in 2004 compared with 2000 - a development that may also be explained by a growing interest in promoting promising young german authors .
" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .
while that may be good news for german literature 's stake in the market , foreign titles are not likely to lose their place on the bestseller lists . megan harris , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .

" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " reunification 's cultural challenge germany 's slow economic reunification german east accused of misappropriation germany -pipe- 02.10.2005 leipzig thriving under reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while parts of the east continue suffering , leipzig 's growth is obvious after 15 years of german reunification , the city of leipzig is booming .
that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .
he 'd like the opportunity to go on vacation again . christian werner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german east accused of misappropriation next week , east german states are required to tell finance minister hans eichel how they spent the billions of euros in subsidies the federal government transferred last year .
a new study does not paint a pretty picture .

germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .

today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .

reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .

initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2005 foreign books dominate german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign fiction gives germans a wider cultural experience germans tend to fancy foreign literature over their own - seeking more diverse and light-hearted reading , but small declines in foreign dominance may indicate a growing interest in germany 's up-and-coming writers . on a busy weekday evening at bonn 's bouvier bookstore , customers perusing the fiction shelves were gravitating to foreign selections .
gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "
investing in new german talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students of the german literature institute in leipzig have hit the market with a new literary style in the fiction market , there were 5 percent fewer english titles released in 2004 compared with 2000 - a development that may also be explained by a growing interest in promoting promising young german authors .
" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .
while that may be good news for german literature 's stake in the market , foreign titles are not likely to lose their place on the bestseller lists . megan harris , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .
he 'd like the opportunity to go on vacation again . christian werner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german east accused of misappropriation next week , east german states are required to tell finance minister hans eichel how they spent the billions of euros in subsidies the federal government transferred last year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " reunification 's cultural challenge germany 's slow economic reunification german east accused of misappropriation germany -pipe- 02.10.2005 leipzig thriving under reunification großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : while parts of the east continue suffering , leipzig 's growth is obvious after 15 years of german reunification , the city of leipzig is booming .
that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .
he 'd like the opportunity to go on vacation again . christian werner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german east accused of misappropriation next week , east german states are required to tell finance minister hans eichel how they spent the billions of euros in subsidies the federal government transferred last year .
a new study does not paint a pretty picture .

28 , 2005 -rrb- east german school outshines competitors east germany discarded the socialist rule that all of its citizens were equal when it came to select schools .
only one such school remains .
could germany learn from it ?
-lrb- july 26 , 2005 -rrb- has rebuilding east germany failed ?
germany 's attempt to rebuild its once communist east has been an unmitigated disaster and the massive financial transfers from the west endanger the entire nation 's economy , according to a government-commissioned report .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .

gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "

" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .

18 elections , leaving germany in political deadlock .
merkel 's christian democrats and their bavarian sister partner won just three seats more in the bundestag lower house of parliament than schröder 's social democrats , far short of a governing majority . although the dresden poll can not significantly alter the preliminary sept .

" ratzinger is seen at the vatican as one of the staunchest opponents of communism , " a stasi spy noted in his file after the late john paul ii named ratzinger prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
the report said the stasi also attempted in vain to unearth damaging documents from ratzinger 's involvement in the hitler youth under the third reich .
pope said to have approved publication an " unofficial collaborator " for the regime using the alias " birke " -lrb- birch -rrb- reported on lectures ratzinger gave at a seminary in the eastern city of erfurt and recognized his importance to the roman catholic church .
" ratzinger is currently , after the pope and secretary of state -lrb- agostino -rrb- casaroli , the most influential political and leading ideologue at the vatican , " a stasi spy wrote in the 1980s .
a spokesman for the stasi archive confirmed on sunday that the east german secret police had indeed spied on ratzinger , according to news agency dpa .
" the stasi appears to have very systematically collected information about ratzinger and his political situation within the church during particular points in his career , " the spokesman said . at least eight stasi spies tracked ratzinger over the years , although only two have been identified . bild am sonntag said the pope personally approved the release of his stasi file . ratzinger was born in the southern german town of marktl am inn in 1927 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most famous non-voter germans eligible to vote headed to the polls sunday .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .

eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .

today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2005 foreign books dominate german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign fiction gives germans a wider cultural experience germans tend to fancy foreign literature over their own - seeking more diverse and light-hearted reading , but small declines in foreign dominance may indicate a growing interest in germany 's up-and-coming writers . on a busy weekday evening at bonn 's bouvier bookstore , customers perusing the fiction shelves were gravitating to foreign selections .
gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "
investing in new german talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many students of the german literature institute in leipzig have hit the market with a new literary style in the fiction market , there were 5 percent fewer english titles released in 2004 compared with 2000 - a development that may also be explained by a growing interest in promoting promising young german authors .
" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .
while that may be good news for german literature 's stake in the market , foreign titles are not likely to lose their place on the bestseller lists . megan harris , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german literature gets bad rap abroad while the international literature festival is under way in berlin , with up to 120 international writers attending the event ; dw- world looks at how contemporary german fiction is fairing abroad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 02.10.2005 the european legacy of the fall of the wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification has proven to be tougher than many expected german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .
after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .
there is less to read just for fun . "
" english-language books , and particularly american , are the most translated due to the sheer size of offerings , " said greiner , adding that the same domination of foreign titles can be seen in other countries .
a fixation for the foreign bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the lord of the rings " was n't just a blockbuster at the movies popularity ratings seem to back up these allegations of literary treason .
a 2004 survey conducted by german broadcaster zdf found that " the lord of the rings " and " harry potter and the sorcerer ’ s stone " ranked in the top 10 of the all time favorite books among germans .
only one german book - thomas mann 's " buddenbrooks " - made it into the top 10 .
the list of the top 100 included a majority of foreign titles .
while sales of foreign titles are not reported and are hard to estimate , the association of german publishers and booksellers reported that translated works made up the biggest share of fiction books - at 20 percent of total new fiction titles for 2004 .
the share of foreign titles is more significant among individual publishers .
for example , a spokeswoman for c.bertelsmann in munich estimated a ratio of 80 percent foreign hard cover titles and 20 percent german hard cover titles in fiction .
the same figures generally describe the ratio at the goldmann company , also part of the random house family in munich , said press director claudia hanssen .
dominance declining ?
companies usually have an incentive to publish english language books because their market performance is already known and critics have already reacted , said greiner .
but publishing figures for 2004 showed a 15 percent decline in the number of english-language titles among the new translated titles on the german market .
whereas in 2000 , english titles accounted for 72 percent of new titles , by 2004 that figure had dropped to 57 percent .
this can be partly explained by the increasing costs for english-language book licenses , said hanssen .
" the book market is depressed , " she said .
" even titles from very famous authors do n't always bring a profit for the publisher , but it 's good for a publisher 's image to publish the latest edition from an author they regularly publish . "

" in addition to attracting licenses from abroad , we also look at very talented young german writers who are likely to be successful on the german market , " said hanssen .
some , such as those trained at the leipzig literature institute -lrb- photo -rrb- , are writing in a different style .
their writing represents something of a new movement and is growing in popularity , said greiner .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

" the picture ... will be very telling , not just for the future of turkey but also for that of the eu , " recep tayyip erdogan said at a conference of his justice and development party in the northwestern spa resort of kizilcahamam . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player , which would show its political maturity , or it will limit itself to a christian club , " erdogan added , in an address broadcast by the cnn turkey tv station .
the prime minister described the decision on opening formal accession talks as a " test " of the bloc 's commitment to the values of pluralism and democracy . eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday night in an 11th hour bid to agree a negotiating framework , which has so far been blocked by austria 's objection to full membership for turkey .
vienna favors the alternative of a " privileged partnership " with turkey , an option rejected by ankara , which threatened this week to not attend monday 's negotiations if such a plan was on the table . straw : key moment in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw speaks to reporters gathered in luxembourg british foreign secretary jack straw , arriving for the emergency meeting , warned that the 25-member bloc stands at a key moment in its history as it prepares to start membership talks with turkey . " this is a crucial meeting for the future of the european union , " he said , underlining that failure to start the talks " would represent a failure for the european union . "
eu foreign policy chief javier solana voiced optimism about the talks .
" i think we will find a deal tonight , " he said . but france 's foreign minister said that the starting of talks does n't guarantee eventual membership .
many top french politicians favor the " privileged partnership " option . " to make believe that negotiations mean entry , that 's a lie , philippe douste-blazy said in a radio and television interview . now or never bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish foreign minister abdullah gül warned sunday that turkey was unlikely to reopen membership negotiations if official entry talks did not begin as scheduled on monday . " i can not see them happening again , " he said in an interview with the yeni safak newspaper .
saying that he considered oct .

17 , providing that turkey implemented certain legal reforms and broadened a customs union to take in 10 new member states , including the disputed island of cyprus . turkey has met these obligations , although concerns were raised at the european parliament in strasbourg last week over ankara 's refusal to let cypriot ships and planes use its ports and airports , as required by the customs deal .
relations with the bloc have also been strained by turkey 's declaration in july reaffirming its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus and by ankara 's refusal to recognize a genocide " against armenians under the ottoman empire during the first world war , a highly sensitive issue for turkey . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .

" the picture ... will be very telling , not just for the future of turkey but also for that of the eu , " recep tayyip erdogan said at a conference of his justice and development party in the northwestern spa resort of kizilcahamam . " either the eu will decide to become a world force and a world player , which would show its political maturity , or it will limit itself to a christian club , " erdogan added , in an address broadcast by the cnn turkey tv station .
the prime minister described the decision on opening formal accession talks as a " test " of the bloc 's commitment to the values of pluralism and democracy . eu foreign ministers met in luxembourg on sunday night in an 11th hour bid to agree a negotiating framework , which has so far been blocked by austria 's objection to full membership for turkey .
vienna favors the alternative of a " privileged partnership " with turkey , an option rejected by ankara , which threatened this week to not attend monday 's negotiations if such a plan was on the table . straw : key moment in history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british foreign secretary jack straw speaks to reporters gathered in luxembourg british foreign secretary jack straw , arriving for the emergency meeting , warned that the 25-member bloc stands at a key moment in its history as it prepares to start membership talks with turkey . " this is a crucial meeting for the future of the european union , " he said , underlining that failure to start the talks " would represent a failure for the european union . "
eu foreign policy chief javier solana voiced optimism about the talks .
" i think we will find a deal tonight , " he said . but france 's foreign minister said that the starting of talks does n't guarantee eventual membership .
many top french politicians favor the " privileged partnership " option . " to make believe that negotiations mean entry , that 's a lie , philippe douste-blazy said in a radio and television interview . now or never bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkish foreign minister abdullah gül warned sunday that turkey was unlikely to reopen membership negotiations if official entry talks did not begin as scheduled on monday . " i can not see them happening again , " he said in an interview with the yeni safak newspaper .
saying that he considered oct .
3 as nothing more than an " implementation date " for decisions already taken by the bloc in december , gül reiterated that turkey was not prepared to " begin negotiations whatever the price . " the bloc approved monday 's planned accession talks on dec .
17 , providing that turkey implemented certain legal reforms and broadened a customs union to take in 10 new member states , including the disputed island of cyprus . turkey has met these obligations , although concerns were raised at the european parliament in strasbourg last week over ankara 's refusal to let cypriot ships and planes use its ports and airports , as required by the customs deal .
relations with the bloc have also been strained by turkey 's declaration in july reaffirming its refusal to recognize the government of cyprus and by ankara 's refusal to recognize a genocide " against armenians under the ottoman empire during the first world war , a highly sensitive issue for turkey . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties disagree on turkey with talks over turkey 's eu entry set to begin on monday , it 's still not clear whether the bloc will offer turkey full membership or an alternative deal - an issue that 's also causing discord among germany 's parties .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german unification , 15 years later genscher : " unification was the only way " germany 's slow economic reunification leipzig thriving under reunification reunification 's cultural challenge germany -pipe- 02.10.2005 the european legacy of the fall of the wall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reunification has proven to be tougher than many expected german reunification and the eu 's eastward expansion have a lot to do with each other .
after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

" ratzinger is seen at the vatican as one of the staunchest opponents of communism , " a stasi spy noted in his file after the late john paul ii named ratzinger prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
the report said the stasi also attempted in vain to unearth damaging documents from ratzinger 's involvement in the hitler youth under the third reich .
pope said to have approved publication an " unofficial collaborator " for the regime using the alias " birke " -lrb- birch -rrb- reported on lectures ratzinger gave at a seminary in the eastern city of erfurt and recognized his importance to the roman catholic church .
" ratzinger is currently , after the pope and secretary of state -lrb- agostino -rrb- casaroli , the most influential political and leading ideologue at the vatican , " a stasi spy wrote in the 1980s .
a spokesman for the stasi archive confirmed on sunday that the east german secret police had indeed spied on ratzinger , according to news agency dpa .
" the stasi appears to have very systematically collected information about ratzinger and his political situation within the church during particular points in his career , " the spokesman said . at least eight stasi spies tracked ratzinger over the years , although only two have been identified . bild am sonntag said the pope personally approved the release of his stasi file . ratzinger was born in the southern german town of marktl am inn in 1927 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most famous non-voter germans eligible to vote headed to the polls sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2005 foreign books dominate german market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign fiction gives germans a wider cultural experience germans tend to fancy foreign literature over their own - seeking more diverse and light-hearted reading , but small declines in foreign dominance may indicate a growing interest in germany 's up-and-coming writers . on a busy weekday evening at bonn 's bouvier bookstore , customers perusing the fiction shelves were gravitating to foreign selections .
gesa weinert was looking for a book for her sister . " she likes crime stories - mostly american and english , ” said weinert , who herself only reads classical german literature as part of her academic research job .
“ if i read foreign literature , it ’ s old - classical . ” weinert was an exception .
most customers , especially younger ones , said they usually prefer foreign fiction over german often because it 's simply more interesting .
“ there are very good crime novels set in cologne , ” said one customer .
“ but crime novels from the us present a different culture . ”
more culture , less angst ulrich greiner , chief literature editor for the german paper die zeit , offered several explanations for germans ' love of foreign books .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists soak in the rays and , hopefully , the culture in italy " it could be because the germans love to travel , " greiner said .
" if you read a foreign book , then you get to know another country . "
but , he added , " german literature comes from a tradition of destruction and has been shaped by war .

" ratzinger is seen at the vatican as one of the staunchest opponents of communism , " a stasi spy noted in his file after the late john paul ii named ratzinger prefect of the congregation for the doctrine of the faith in 1981 .
the report said the stasi also attempted in vain to unearth damaging documents from ratzinger 's involvement in the hitler youth under the third reich .
pope said to have approved publication an " unofficial collaborator " for the regime using the alias " birke " -lrb- birch -rrb- reported on lectures ratzinger gave at a seminary in the eastern city of erfurt and recognized his importance to the roman catholic church .
" ratzinger is currently , after the pope and secretary of state -lrb- agostino -rrb- casaroli , the most influential political and leading ideologue at the vatican , " a stasi spy wrote in the 1980s .
a spokesman for the stasi archive confirmed on sunday that the east german secret police had indeed spied on ratzinger , according to news agency dpa .
" the stasi appears to have very systematically collected information about ratzinger and his political situation within the church during particular points in his career , " the spokesman said . at least eight stasi spies tracked ratzinger over the years , although only two have been identified . bild am sonntag said the pope personally approved the release of his stasi file . ratzinger was born in the southern german town of marktl am inn in 1927 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's most famous non-voter germans eligible to vote headed to the polls sunday .

" the picture ... will be very telling , not just for the future of turkey but also for that of the eu , " recep tayyip erdogan said at a conference of his justice and development party in the northwestern spa resort of kizilcahamam .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .
he 'd like the opportunity to go on vacation again . christian werner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german east accused of misappropriation next week , east german states are required to tell finance minister hans eichel how they spent the billions of euros in subsidies the federal government transferred last year .

after the wall fell , it was clear that the other nations of europe , now free from soviet hegemony , were eager to be integrated . in the past 15 years , the mood surrounding both german reunification and the eastern expansion of the eu has sobered significantly .
germany still has a long road to travel in mending the rift between east and west , and is only at the beginning of long-term structural reforms .
meanwhile , the enthusiasm for the grand european project , as seen in the rejection of the constitutional contract , has largely dissipated . welcome to the club fifteen years after german reunification , european unification is nearly complete .
in 2004 , the eu took in eight additional eastern european nations as well as malta and cyprus .
both processes are seen as two sides of the same coin by the eu in brussels .
as luxembourg 's prime minister jean claude juncker has said , before 1989 , the back wall of the european house was the berlin wall .
when that crumbled , the eu had to think in a new direction and take in not only the german democratic republic , but also other former communist states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister joschka fischer strongly supports eu integration in retrospect , there was no alternative to the integration of germany and europe - something german foreign minister joschka fischer is fond of emphasizing today .
initial reservations concerned with reunification are no longer raised by british and french diplomats .
the german government proved during the 1990s that it would remain an engaged supporter of european integration .
parallel to reunification , germany supported the economic and monetary union and increased political integration , as sealed in the 1993 maastricht treaty . financial strains of reunification the increased political power of the united , most populous european country is not seen as a cause for concern in brussels today .
much more worrying is the deep structural crisis in germany 's economic and social systems , which affects all of europe .
when german economic growth is weak and the deficit grows , this weighs heavily on the economic strength of europe as a whole . that this is partially a result of german reunification is clear to eu monetary commissioner joaquin almunia .
in the reformed stability and growth pact of the eu , the german minister of finance is permitted to make a special allowance for the deficit difficulties resulting from germany 's reunification process .
because of germany 's internal transfers of aid money , its net payments to brussels have been cut in half since the mid-1990s .
germany 's reunification thus plays out on europe 's financial situation . the effects of german reunification and the subsequent increased integration of europe have also been felt in the balance of power within the eu .
the focus of the bloc has shifted further eastwards .
the franco-german " motor " is no longer so important , and its right to drive the eu is openly called into question . the national interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all germans are wildly enthusiastic about eu expansion the crisis which has enveloped the european union due to fractious budgetary talks and the failure to ratify the constitution has sharpened the european dilemma .
the constitutional contract , the last great shared political project through which europe 's statesmen , including germany 's foreign minister , had hoped to make a mark , has been lost for the time being .
the eu is looking for a new leadership structure , and reunited germany , its largest member state , ca n't deliver . in the past few years , the country has fallen , in the view of brussels , from the model european to a braking force which , like france and great britain , looks out for its national interest .
the currently weak eu commission has therefore been focusing on promoting the goals of the lisbon process .
but given the insecure future of german leadership , the growing budget gap and the unwillingness for reform , things are looking grim . eurocrats and members of the european parliament also find it regrettable that germany appears to be less enthusiastic about europe .
this discomfort has only been increased through the red-green government , according to the chairman of the european parliament 's foreign affairs committee , elmar brok -lrb- cdu -rrb- , who says the current government has been portraying itself as a hero fighting against supposed overregulation in brussels .
the fraternization of bar room talk and national governments against brussels is a phenomenon observable not only in germany , but in many eu member states .
this regularly leads to dismal voter turnout at european elections and the strengthening of anti-europe sentiment . bernd riegert -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : genscher : " unification was the only way " germany is gearing up for its national day , when the country celebrates the oct .

that ca n't be said for all of the former east germany . politically , the reunification of germany was , without a doubt , a long-sought goal in the west .
but economically , the reports coming from the former east germany are disheartening .
eastern germany suffers from unemployment rates about twice as high as the west .
and while some eastern cities are expanding , 15 years in a unified germany has had little effect on others . it is easy to fall back on clichés when talking about the former german democratic republic , as christian social union leader edmund stoiber did during the september election calling east germans " frustrated " people .
but even in leipzig , one of eastern germany 's success stories , the situation is n't so easy to pigeonhole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : construction cranes are a regular sight in leipzig construction booming pedestrians and drivers in leipzig should be accustomed to the cranes , construction zones and scaffolding that require ever-changing detours and head-ducking - they 've lived with it since the middle of the 1990s . german reunification set loose a flurry of construction projects to keep the city from deteriorating more than it did while under communist rule .
today 's projects are modernizing the city again by building a new subway system , widening roads and putting up stylish new shopping areas .
the city is also the new home to porsche and bmw factories and a logistics hub for the dhl package delivery company . but even the construction and new factories can not hide the fact that 20 percent of people in leipzig do n't have jobs and depend on welfare to make ends meet . " we 've done an unbelievable amount in the past 15 years , " said leipzig 's mayor wolfgang tiefensee , who enjoys comparing his city to european metropolises like paris and london .
" but there 's one important field where we have n't been successful : the labor market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some parts of the east are still in bad condition small companies suffering for the past 25 years , dietmar rauch has worked in a household goods store in one of leipzig 's more stylish neighborhoods where the bars and cafes are usually full of people .
though the 47-year-old has n't shed a tear for the passing of the communist government , the euphoria he felt 15 years ago has been sobered by his fight to stay above water financially . " back then , i worked 12 or 14 hours a day , but i also took two three-week vacations a year and made money , " he said .
" now i work the same amount of time , do n't make anything after paying for expenses and do n't go on vacation any more . " although others in the city echo rauch 's comments , there is no general sense of despondency , and most people in leipzig believe their city is going to continue improving .
martin rosenfeld , an economist at the halle institute for economic research , agrees with the optimists and said that eastern germany stands to have a good chance in the european market if it manages its investments correctly . subsidies were mismanaged bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not all of the money spent improved east germany 's infrastructure " the failure has been with how the funds have been spread around the region without any appropriate central oversight , " rosenfeld said .
" all east german states were offered the same conditions and the municipal infrastructure was improved everywhere with the same kind of industrial parks springing up all over . " over the past 15 years , the german government has transferred 1.3 trillion euros -lrb- $ 1.6 trillion -rrb- to the former east german states to help bring them up to speed with the western states .
reports released in the run-up to the 15th anniversary of reunification showed much of the money was wasted on inefficient projects incapable of bringing real growth to the area .
current plans call for the subsidies only to be given to projects and companies that can prove they have good chances of surviving in the marketplace and creating jobs locally . just how successfully the new concept will be implemented remains to be seen , but dietmar rauch said he hopes whatever new money comes into leipzig invigorates the city .
he 'd like the opportunity to go on vacation again . christian werner -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german east accused of misappropriation next week , east german states are required to tell finance minister hans eichel how they spent the billions of euros in subsidies the federal government transferred last year .

christian barning , from germany , was in a local shopping mall in kuta with his girlfriend isabel when one of the bombs went off less than 20 metres away .
" we were in the entrance of the mall .
we heard the bomb , it was a very loud bang , and then there were people running out .
they did n't freak out , and they did n't scream , " he told the bbc news website .
" you could feel the pressure of the bomb , and we just tried to get out .
but there was n't this big panic . "
" the noise was deafening - like a thousand fireworks going off at one time " james hughes , eyewitness from jersey but george maccallum from london , uk , said there was mayhem .
" manic on the streets , no one really knows what 's going on , " he told the bbc news website .
" i saw people running and crying .
police telling everyone where to go .
all tourists have given up for the night , everyone trying to get internet access , nightspots are empty .
there 's an air of unease and unrest here . "
' a bit of panic ' james hughes of jersey said he was having dinner just down the road from the kuta blast .
" the noise was deafening .
like a thousand fireworks going off at one time , " he said .
dutch student chris van der draai described the panic at the jimbaran resort .
" we had a bit of panic , everybody panicked , " he told the bbc , " but i think , with the first bomb , many people just stood up and everybody ran down to the beach ... and the second bomb went off , so i think some people were very lucky that ... both bombs were n't exploded together . "
ketut suartana was in the middle of his meal when the bombs went off .
" we were eating and suddenly it just went dark , " he told reuters news agency from his hospital bed after being injured by the explosions .
" i tried to run but i kept falling over .
then the second blast happened . "
' gas bottles ' anthony brearley , from melbourne , australia , had arrived in bali on friday with his wife and two young children .
he and his wife were in a cafe when they heard the first bomb go off .
" there was a frightening noise , and then the second one went off quite soon after that .
the locals were taking it very calmly , but the tourists were running away ...
" they were saying it was gas bottles exploding , which is apparently quite common .
we were sitting with a big group of people and everyone just knew it was a bomb .
" my wife works for a burns unit and she wanted to go down there and help , but she was n't allowed through . "
visiting english tourist chris ryan could not believe the island had been targeted a second time , and described the aftermath : " i did n't actually think it would happen again , but it 's happened and , i do n't know , it 's just one of those things , it 's just unbelievable .
" everybody around here is kind of just shocked .

free of the usual strictures of party discipline , they have been able to speak out as their party debates its future .
that period of latitude will end once the leadership contest is sealed .
the change might be felt particularly hard by nick herbert , whose job as head of think tank reform was to be free thinking and provocative .
but the 42-year-old says he was elected to parliament because of his party first and his name second .
" any backbencher is shackled , " he says , laughing .
" there is a system of whips .
this is the faustian pact you make when you sign up .
it 's like joining any organisation , of course it is .
" but i will try and continue to express my views , my ideas as constructively as i can . "
those views will be heard particularly attentively if david davis wins the tory leadership race .
' renewed radicalism ' mr herbert was a davis campaign manager in 2001 and is part of his campaign team this time too .
the shadow home secretary has said public services will be a key battleground at the next election - and the issue has been mr herbert 's speciality in recent years .
he landed his arundel and south downs seat after mp howard flight was sacked by the tory leadership after hinting plans for spending cuts went further than the party had admitted . "
we have got to be careful of allowing ourselves to be imprisoned by a fear that our motives are always to be mistrusted " nick herbert and he says his views about the need for " really quite radical reform of public services " have been reinforced by hearing first hand about his constituents ' problems .
mr herbert has already described tory election policies on the issue as " limp offerings " .
he says the party 's five election pledges had the advantage of clarity but they did not say quite enough .
the policies need to be renewed , he says , but the party also needs to show the public it has a clear sense of direction .
" i think the public are less interested in mechanism , " he says .
" they need to hear from us that our goal is to achieve better public services for everyone . "
final destination among the ideas he wants examined are the kind of schemes used elsewhere in europe where everybody pays for health insurance instead of paying taxes - with the costs met for those unable to afford them .
ken clarke last week warned that the tories currently lacked the credibility to propose radical reform of public services because so many people believed they wanted to privatise them .
but mr herbert counters that it is not just the tories saying a mixture of service providers is needed to make schools and hospitals more equitable .
" i recognise the difficulties which is why i have said that it 's very important that we make clear the end destination , which is better public services for everyone .
" but i think we 've got to be careful about getting ourselves in a position where we ca n't talk about anything and indeed of allowing ourselves to be imprisoned by a fear that our motives are always to be mistrusted . "
mr herbert is among the band of new mps who called for major changes in conservative policies in a pamphlet called direct democracy .
he says " localism " - allowing individuals and local communities to take key decisions instead of mps and officials in whitehall - is an idea whose time has come .
' watch the vision ' the mp says the conservative party is now getting hungry to win again .
if it can unite behind whoever is elected leader to renew campaigning and policy , then there are big opportunities as blair hands over to brown , he argues .
" it is a mistake just to believe that the pendulum will swing and all we have to do is sit tight and wait for more favourable election conditions ...
" the public have to a large extent begun to make up their minds about new labour .
of course , we have to offer a critique but it is more about defining what we stand for , the vision we want to see . "
all this makes mr herbert believe it is a good time to be a new conservative mp - it may help , of course , that he also has the chance to forge the campaign of leadership favourite mr davis .

the annual apple festival , held at erddig hall , near wrexham on saturday and sunday , delves into the history of one of britain 's favourite fruits .
the stately home is inviting visitors to bring a home-grown apple along to be identified by experts .
erddig 's own orchards boast more than 100 different varieties .
apples were first cultivated by the romans over 2,000 years ago .
" we have a tremendous amount to be grateful to the romans for , " said erddig 's erin robinson .
" if it was n't for them , there would n't be any apple pie , apple cobbler , apple fritters , apple cider or even apple butter .
simply expressed , there would be no plump , juicy apples . "
the romans introduced many apple varieties when the romans invaded in 55bc , they brought in their own varieties and also blended them with the then wild british crab apple .
there are now an estimated 6,000 different varieties of the fruit being grown here .
organisers of the festival are hoping for a good response to their appeal for local apples .
with the major roman city of chester is only 12 miles away from erddig hall , and evidence of roman activity spread over the area , they are hoping for some interesting discoveries .
" there are 32 different varieties of apple specific to cheshire alone which , due to sheer geography , must have some roman influence within them , " ms robinson said .
" it 's not only this ; a few years ago the berkeley pippin apple was thought to be extinct until identified at a similar apple day - which shows why people should bring their apples along to erddig for id , just in case . "
the festival , now in its 15th year , has become a popular annual event .
attractions on offer are all apple-linked , and include basket weaving , archery , an arts and crafts marquee , food , music , and dancing .
and no apple festival would be complete without cider , of course .
" we have a cider press set up which will be taking the apples grown in erddigs own orchards and crushing them down ready for making cider , " ms robinson said .
" the fermentation period for the drink is four months , but those wishing to sample the brew need n't worry , as we 've plenty we prepared earlier ! "

the annual apple festival , held at erddig hall , near wrexham on saturday and sunday , delves into the history of one of britain 's favourite fruits .
the stately home is inviting visitors to bring a home-grown apple along to be identified by experts .
erddig 's own orchards boast more than 100 different varieties .
apples were first cultivated by the romans over 2,000 years ago .
" we have a tremendous amount to be grateful to the romans for , " said erddig 's erin robinson .
" if it was n't for them , there would n't be any apple pie , apple cobbler , apple fritters , apple cider or even apple butter .
simply expressed , there would be no plump , juicy apples . "
the romans introduced many apple varieties when the romans invaded in 55bc , they brought in their own varieties and also blended them with the then wild british crab apple .
there are now an estimated 6,000 different varieties of the fruit being grown here .
organisers of the festival are hoping for a good response to their appeal for local apples .
with the major roman city of chester is only 12 miles away from erddig hall , and evidence of roman activity spread over the area , they are hoping for some interesting discoveries .
" there are 32 different varieties of apple specific to cheshire alone which , due to sheer geography , must have some roman influence within them , " ms robinson said .
" it 's not only this ; a few years ago the berkeley pippin apple was thought to be extinct until identified at a similar apple day - which shows why people should bring their apples along to erddig for id , just in case . "
the festival , now in its 15th year , has become a popular annual event .
attractions on offer are all apple-linked , and include basket weaving , archery , an arts and crafts marquee , food , music , and dancing .
and no apple festival would be complete without cider , of course .
" we have a cider press set up which will be taking the apples grown in erddigs own orchards and crushing them down ready for making cider , " ms robinson said .
" the fermentation period for the drink is four months , but those wishing to sample the brew need n't worry , as we 've plenty we prepared earlier ! "

university of manchester scientists have designed a rig that combines floats to turn waves into electricity .
if put into full-scale use , the " manchester bobber " would be attached to a rig 65ft above the sea .
co-inventor peter stansby said " virtually nothing " had been done to " scale up " wave energy up until now .

" the bobber 's output of five megawatts is the mean power output , with the potential of much more depending on the conditions . "
the bobber 's mechanical and electrical components would be kept high above sea level to make them more accessible for repairs and less vulnerable to sea water damage .
a series of units placed together would provide a means to increase energy output , the engineer magazine reported .
' next step ' manchester intellectual property , the university 's spin-out company , has applied for an engineering and physical sciences research council grant to test a combination of up to 49 units .
" despite all the talk about wave energy there has been virtually nothing done on scaling up to see how different units interact with each other , " mr stansby said .
