program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 26.06.2005 wake up and smell the sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan matched brazil goal for goal and tackle for tackle in group b why were so many people at the confed cup surprised by the fact that japan could play soccer ?
dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies thinks it has a lot to do with reporting attitudes and favoritism . it was either the most uninformed or patronizing comment i have heard so far during the confederations cup .
" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .
and wolf-dieter poschmann would probably have needed emergency resuscitation . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro , left , celebrates as he runs past angelo basinas and antonios nikopolidis , of greece after scoring the winning goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and japan in frankfurt , germany sunday june 19 , 2005 . french icon michel platini once remarked that japan play a brand of " future football " .

estaban cambiasso 's spot-kick winner sets up a south american showpiece on wednesday . inter milan midfielder cambiasso came up with the winner after mexico defender ricardo osorio 's effort was saved by argentina keeper german lux . this ill-tempered semi-final had to be decided by spot kicks after the sides were deadlocked at 1-1 , carlos salcido putting mexico ahead in the 14th minute of extra time , with luciano figueroa leveling six minutes later . the game was scarred by the first red cards of the competition , with argentina 's javier saviola sent off in the 90th minute and mexico 's rafael marquez following him off the pitch in injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico , missing defender aaron galindo and midfielder salvador carmona , who were sent home in disgrace on tuesday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolene , welcomed back marquez .

estaban cambiasso 's spot-kick winner sets up a south american showpiece on wednesday . inter milan midfielder cambiasso came up with the winner after mexico defender ricardo osorio 's effort was saved by argentina keeper german lux . this ill-tempered semi-final had to be decided by spot kicks after the sides were deadlocked at 1-1 , carlos salcido putting mexico ahead in the 14th minute of extra time , with luciano figueroa leveling six minutes later . the game was scarred by the first red cards of the competition , with argentina 's javier saviola sent off in the 90th minute and mexico 's rafael marquez following him off the pitch in injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico , missing defender aaron galindo and midfielder salvador carmona , who were sent home in disgrace on tuesday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolene , welcomed back marquez .
but the barcelona star 's first major imprint on the game was not a positive one - a cynical tackle on javier saviola in the 21st minute securing him his first yellow card . the first half was evenly balanced as stoic work by both sets of defenses meant goal scoring opportunities were thin on the ground . chances few and far between argentina had to wait until one minute before the break for their best chance when only mexico midfielder gonzalo pineda 's quick reflexes denied juan sorin 's close range shot into an open goal .
mexico had earlier come close to breaking the midfield deadlock with argentina keeper german lux only able to deflect sinha 's shot behind his line for a corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on 36 minutes ramon morales was brought down in the box but italian referee roberto rosetti brushed aside mexico 's claims for a penalty , much to the chagrin of coach ricardo la volpe , looking as cool as anything in jeans on the bench . argentina , wearing black armbands in memory of a young goalkeeper who died on saturday , started the second half brightly with luciano figueroa putting a purposeful header over oswaldo sanchez ' bar . woodwork denies mexico up at the other end sinha , with his right hand bandaged , unleashed a shot from just outside the box which , with lux beaten , rocketed off the right post .
the brazilian-born midfielder has excelled in this competition .
what he makes up for in stature- - he was the shortest player on the pitch - he more than makes up for in ability . mexico goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez is another who has caught the eye this month in germany , and he produced a great save to keep out argentina defender fabricio colocchini 's 58th minute effort .
the mop-haired deportivo la coruna defender was then booked in the 69th minute after a thuggish challenge on morales , who had to be stretchered off in evident distress . players see red as frustrations boil over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ill-tempered game then took on a reddish hue with saviola first to feel rosetti 's wrath when he lashed out at gonzalo pineda - the monaco player misses wednesday 's final . marquez was sent packing when he picked up his second yellow for a nasty challenge on pablo aimar . in the 14th minute of extra time salcido 's deflected shot from the left hopped over lux and into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but figueroa leveled with his fourth goal of the competition , juggling the ball on his heel before shooting under sanchez from point blank range , to leave penalties the only answer with cambriasso holding his nerve to end mexico 's 21 match unbeaten run . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ?

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .

" reckoned in euros , the price of crude oil has leapt about 60 percent since january .
we 're really facing a crisis , " said lorenzo codogno , an economist at the bank of america . by comparison , the cost of a barrel of crude oil in new york has jumped just 38 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the one hand , the easing off of the euro , now worth about $ 1.20 as against 1.35 in january , has had a positive result , making eurozone exporters more competitive . " but this positive effect will not really be felt for some months while consumers are affected almost immediately by price rises of imported products , " codogno said . german inflation figures a good example came on friday with the publication in germany of inflation figures for june .
residents of north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany , have seen their petrol prices rise 6.6 percent in a year while domestic heating oil have leapt 38.7 percent . furthermore , british airways has announced that from monday it is increasing the surcharge on its flights to offset surging fuel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british airways is planning to increase fuel surcharges what could be better guaranteed to stifle consumption in europe and its biggest economy , germany , just as the winds of recovery were starting to blow ? the french government has just revised downwards its growth targets for this year to roughly two percent .
the national statistics institute -lrb- insee -rrb- reckons that the figure will be even lower at 1.5 per cent . french prime minister dominique de villepin admitted last week that the historic high of $ 60 a barrel was " a heavy burden on us and our economy . " all eyes on ecb all eyes are now fixed on the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
speculation on the possible lowering of interest rates is one of the chief reasons for the annual slackening of the single currency . the recent lowering of interest rates by the swedish central bank and the vote by two of the nine members of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee in favour of monetary relaxation has stepped up pressure on the ecb . this month , german economy minister wolfgang clement urged the ecb to follow the swedish example . for the moment , the bank has turned a deaf ear .
its monetary policy is already " extremely accommodating , " said christian noyer , governor of the bank of france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet however , it has softened its tone of late and has stopped insisting that lower rates are not an option as its president jean-claude trichet -lrb- photo -rrb- said in may . the ecb 's governors " are clearly not ready to act just at the moment .
but if the indicators continue to be bad , they are going to revise their estimates for growth and inflation in september and perhaps cut the key interest rate , which has been set at two percent since june 2003 , " codogno said . the ecb is in a difficult position because the rise in crude oil prices while affecting growth , also fuels inflation .
it is the bank 's first job to keep inflation in check . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .
-lrb- march 1 , 2005 -rrb- eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution .
-lrb- june 7 , 2005 -rrb- berlin cuts growth forecast , slams ecb the german government scaled back its 2005 growth forecasts on friday , saying its earlier prognosis had been too optimistic .

dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies thinks it has a lot to do with reporting attitudes and favoritism . it was either the most uninformed or patronizing comment i have heard so far during the confederations cup .
" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .
and wolf-dieter poschmann would probably have needed emergency resuscitation . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro , left , celebrates as he runs past angelo basinas and antonios nikopolidis , of greece after scoring the winning goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and japan in frankfurt , germany sunday june 19 , 2005 . french icon michel platini once remarked that japan play a brand of " future football " .

" the nuclear issue is a part of a macro policy , and our position will not change with the change of a president , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . but he added : " with this election , the islamic republic of iran is more capable of confronting challenges , and the europeans have to take this into consideration . " nervous reactions the eu reacted nervously to ahmadinejad 's shock victory , as well as the humiliating defeat for moderate cleric akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who was widely viewed as a more liberal negotiating partner . franco frattini , european commissioner for justice and security issues , said the eu could " freeze " talks with iran unless ahmadinejad made an early commitment to talks with the eu-3 of germany , france and britain on the nuclear issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " the reformists have suffered a worrying defeat , " said frattini .
" from the new president ahmadinejad we are waiting for clear words on human rights and the nuclear issue .
but if the replies are negative , the european union will have no choice but to freeze dialogue with iran , " frattini told italy 's la repubblica newspaper . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with britain , france and germany , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . " we will not give up our right , " asefi said , repeating iran 's demand to end the freeze on fuel cycle work .
" we will reach bright results through negotiations . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he is expecting business as usual when the next round of talks resume . " germany expects that talks between france , the united kingdom , germany and eu foreign policy chief -lrb- javier -rrb- solana will continue with the new president under the terms of the paris agreement , " said fischer . " economic cooperation also rests on how successfully iran can secure international trust and further open itself , " he added in a statement in the german daily bild . hoping for " early steps " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between eu and iranian leaders are aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he wanted iran to continue with the talks , and british foreign secretary jack straw said he hoped ahmadinejad would " take early steps to address international concerns about its nuclear program and policies toward terrorism , human rights and the middle east peace process . " " we will work hard , with our eu partners and bilaterally , to encourage action by iran in these areas so that iran can return to its rightful place in the international community , " straw said . but iranian spokesman asefi hit back . " the europeans and mr straw should give their nuclear proposal as soon as possible , which includes iran 's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes , " he said . " they should stop making inappropriate comments .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .
" everyone our age knows the music we sing , and hearing them sung in another language takes a lot of getting used to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.06.2005 opinion : six months after the tsunami großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , there is still a lot of work to be done six months have passed since a violent tsunami rose from the indian ocean , bringing death and destruction to many coastal areas .
aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ?
-lrb- feb .
19 , 2005 -rrb- tsunami relief all positive government says around five months after the tsunami disaster in south asia , berlin presented an optimistic preliminary report .
over 200 partner initiatives have been started .
the opposition believes the whole truth is n't being told .
-lrb- m1y 18 , 2005 -rrb- doing better than " business as usual " three months after a tsunami devastated resorts in south asia , the region is the focus of the world 's biggest tourism fair in berlin .
tourists are being asked to return , but can the industry learn from past mistakes ?

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .
" everyone our age knows the music we sing , and hearing them sung in another language takes a lot of getting used to .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .
" everyone our age knows the music we sing , and hearing them sung in another language takes a lot of getting used to .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 26.06.2005 sino-german pop walks on the wild side großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rockin ' and rollin ' in chinese ever heard a german band singing beatles hits in chinese ?
probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .
" everyone our age knows the music we sing , and hearing them sung in another language takes a lot of getting used to .

their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock .

so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .

drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock .

on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .

negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

" the nuclear issue is a part of a macro policy , and our position will not change with the change of a president , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . but he added : " with this election , the islamic republic of iran is more capable of confronting challenges , and the europeans have to take this into consideration . " nervous reactions the eu reacted nervously to ahmadinejad 's shock victory , as well as the humiliating defeat for moderate cleric akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who was widely viewed as a more liberal negotiating partner . franco frattini , european commissioner for justice and security issues , said the eu could " freeze " talks with iran unless ahmadinejad made an early commitment to talks with the eu-3 of germany , france and britain on the nuclear issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " the reformists have suffered a worrying defeat , " said frattini .
" from the new president ahmadinejad we are waiting for clear words on human rights and the nuclear issue .
but if the replies are negative , the european union will have no choice but to freeze dialogue with iran , " frattini told italy 's la repubblica newspaper . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with britain , france and germany , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . " we will not give up our right , " asefi said , repeating iran 's demand to end the freeze on fuel cycle work .
" we will reach bright results through negotiations . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he is expecting business as usual when the next round of talks resume . " germany expects that talks between france , the united kingdom , germany and eu foreign policy chief -lrb- javier -rrb- solana will continue with the new president under the terms of the paris agreement , " said fischer . " economic cooperation also rests on how successfully iran can secure international trust and further open itself , " he added in a statement in the german daily bild . hoping for " early steps " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : talks between eu and iranian leaders are aimed at avoiding an escalation of tehran 's standoff with the west on its nuclear program french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said he wanted iran to continue with the talks , and british foreign secretary jack straw said he hoped ahmadinejad would " take early steps to address international concerns about its nuclear program and policies toward terrorism , human rights and the middle east peace process . " " we will work hard , with our eu partners and bilaterally , to encourage action by iran in these areas so that iran can return to its rightful place in the international community , " straw said . but iranian spokesman asefi hit back . " the europeans and mr straw should give their nuclear proposal as soon as possible , which includes iran 's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes , " he said .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 26.06.2005 wake up and smell the sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan matched brazil goal for goal and tackle for tackle in group b why were so many people at the confed cup surprised by the fact that japan could play soccer ?
dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies thinks it has a lot to do with reporting attitudes and favoritism . it was either the most uninformed or patronizing comment i have heard so far during the confederations cup .
" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world . " dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany welcomes annan 's call for action kofi annan 's ambitious reform plans for the united nations have met with a largely positive response in europe .
germany feels it 's inched closer to reaching its goal of a permanent seat on the un security council .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.06.2005 opinion : six months after the tsunami großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , there is still a lot of work to be done six months have passed since a violent tsunami rose from the indian ocean , bringing death and destruction to many coastal areas .
aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.06.2005 opinion : six months after the tsunami großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , there is still a lot of work to be done six months have passed since a violent tsunami rose from the indian ocean , bringing death and destruction to many coastal areas .
aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ?

estaban cambiasso 's spot-kick winner sets up a south american showpiece on wednesday . inter milan midfielder cambiasso came up with the winner after mexico defender ricardo osorio 's effort was saved by argentina keeper german lux . this ill-tempered semi-final had to be decided by spot kicks after the sides were deadlocked at 1-1 , carlos salcido putting mexico ahead in the 14th minute of extra time , with luciano figueroa leveling six minutes later . the game was scarred by the first red cards of the competition , with argentina 's javier saviola sent off in the 90th minute and mexico 's rafael marquez following him off the pitch in injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico , missing defender aaron galindo and midfielder salvador carmona , who were sent home in disgrace on tuesday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolene , welcomed back marquez .
but the barcelona star 's first major imprint on the game was not a positive one - a cynical tackle on javier saviola in the 21st minute securing him his first yellow card . the first half was evenly balanced as stoic work by both sets of defenses meant goal scoring opportunities were thin on the ground . chances few and far between argentina had to wait until one minute before the break for their best chance when only mexico midfielder gonzalo pineda 's quick reflexes denied juan sorin 's close range shot into an open goal .
mexico had earlier come close to breaking the midfield deadlock with argentina keeper german lux only able to deflect sinha 's shot behind his line for a corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on 36 minutes ramon morales was brought down in the box but italian referee roberto rosetti brushed aside mexico 's claims for a penalty , much to the chagrin of coach ricardo la volpe , looking as cool as anything in jeans on the bench . argentina , wearing black armbands in memory of a young goalkeeper who died on saturday , started the second half brightly with luciano figueroa putting a purposeful header over oswaldo sanchez ' bar . woodwork denies mexico up at the other end sinha , with his right hand bandaged , unleashed a shot from just outside the box which , with lux beaten , rocketed off the right post .
the brazilian-born midfielder has excelled in this competition .
what he makes up for in stature- - he was the shortest player on the pitch - he more than makes up for in ability . mexico goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez is another who has caught the eye this month in germany , and he produced a great save to keep out argentina defender fabricio colocchini 's 58th minute effort .
the mop-haired deportivo la coruna defender was then booked in the 69th minute after a thuggish challenge on morales , who had to be stretchered off in evident distress . players see red as frustrations boil over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ill-tempered game then took on a reddish hue with saviola first to feel rosetti 's wrath when he lashed out at gonzalo pineda - the monaco player misses wednesday 's final . marquez was sent packing when he picked up his second yellow for a nasty challenge on pablo aimar . in the 14th minute of extra time salcido 's deflected shot from the left hopped over lux and into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but figueroa leveled with his fourth goal of the competition , juggling the ball on his heel before shooting under sanchez from point blank range , to leave penalties the only answer with cambriasso holding his nerve to end mexico 's 21 match unbeaten run . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .

but the barcelona star 's first major imprint on the game was not a positive one - a cynical tackle on javier saviola in the 21st minute securing him his first yellow card . the first half was evenly balanced as stoic work by both sets of defenses meant goal scoring opportunities were thin on the ground . chances few and far between argentina had to wait until one minute before the break for their best chance when only mexico midfielder gonzalo pineda 's quick reflexes denied juan sorin 's close range shot into an open goal .
mexico had earlier come close to breaking the midfield deadlock with argentina keeper german lux only able to deflect sinha 's shot behind his line for a corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on 36 minutes ramon morales was brought down in the box but italian referee roberto rosetti brushed aside mexico 's claims for a penalty , much to the chagrin of coach ricardo la volpe , looking as cool as anything in jeans on the bench . argentina , wearing black armbands in memory of a young goalkeeper who died on saturday , started the second half brightly with luciano figueroa putting a purposeful header over oswaldo sanchez ' bar . woodwork denies mexico up at the other end sinha , with his right hand bandaged , unleashed a shot from just outside the box which , with lux beaten , rocketed off the right post .
the brazilian-born midfielder has excelled in this competition .
what he makes up for in stature- - he was the shortest player on the pitch - he more than makes up for in ability . mexico goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez is another who has caught the eye this month in germany , and he produced a great save to keep out argentina defender fabricio colocchini 's 58th minute effort .
the mop-haired deportivo la coruna defender was then booked in the 69th minute after a thuggish challenge on morales , who had to be stretchered off in evident distress . players see red as frustrations boil over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ill-tempered game then took on a reddish hue with saviola first to feel rosetti 's wrath when he lashed out at gonzalo pineda - the monaco player misses wednesday 's final . marquez was sent packing when he picked up his second yellow for a nasty challenge on pablo aimar . in the 14th minute of extra time salcido 's deflected shot from the left hopped over lux and into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but figueroa leveled with his fourth goal of the competition , juggling the ball on his heel before shooting under sanchez from point blank range , to leave penalties the only answer with cambriasso holding his nerve to end mexico 's 21 match unbeaten run . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.06.2005 opinion : six months after the tsunami großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , there is still a lot of work to be done six months have passed since a violent tsunami rose from the indian ocean , bringing death and destruction to many coastal areas .
aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ?

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .

" we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

" reckoned in euros , the price of crude oil has leapt about 60 percent since january .
we 're really facing a crisis , " said lorenzo codogno , an economist at the bank of america . by comparison , the cost of a barrel of crude oil in new york has jumped just 38 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the one hand , the easing off of the euro , now worth about $ 1.20 as against 1.35 in january , has had a positive result , making eurozone exporters more competitive . " but this positive effect will not really be felt for some months while consumers are affected almost immediately by price rises of imported products , " codogno said . german inflation figures a good example came on friday with the publication in germany of inflation figures for june .
residents of north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany , have seen their petrol prices rise 6.6 percent in a year while domestic heating oil have leapt 38.7 percent . furthermore , british airways has announced that from monday it is increasing the surcharge on its flights to offset surging fuel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british airways is planning to increase fuel surcharges what could be better guaranteed to stifle consumption in europe and its biggest economy , germany , just as the winds of recovery were starting to blow ? the french government has just revised downwards its growth targets for this year to roughly two percent .
the national statistics institute -lrb- insee -rrb- reckons that the figure will be even lower at 1.5 per cent . french prime minister dominique de villepin admitted last week that the historic high of $ 60 a barrel was " a heavy burden on us and our economy . " all eyes on ecb all eyes are now fixed on the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
speculation on the possible lowering of interest rates is one of the chief reasons for the annual slackening of the single currency . the recent lowering of interest rates by the swedish central bank and the vote by two of the nine members of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee in favour of monetary relaxation has stepped up pressure on the ecb . this month , german economy minister wolfgang clement urged the ecb to follow the swedish example . for the moment , the bank has turned a deaf ear .
its monetary policy is already " extremely accommodating , " said christian noyer , governor of the bank of france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet however , it has softened its tone of late and has stopped insisting that lower rates are not an option as its president jean-claude trichet -lrb- photo -rrb- said in may . the ecb 's governors " are clearly not ready to act just at the moment .
but if the indicators continue to be bad , they are going to revise their estimates for growth and inflation in september and perhaps cut the key interest rate , which has been set at two percent since june 2003 , " codogno said . the ecb is in a difficult position because the rise in crude oil prices while affecting growth , also fuels inflation .
it is the bank 's first job to keep inflation in check . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .
-lrb- march 1 , 2005 -rrb- eu finance ministers aim to bolster euro european union finance ministers on tuesday tried at a summit in luxembourg to get back to business amid continuing fallout from the crisis surrounding the rejection of the bloc 's first-ever constitution .

dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies thinks it has a lot to do with reporting attitudes and favoritism . it was either the most uninformed or patronizing comment i have heard so far during the confederations cup .
" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .
and wolf-dieter poschmann would probably have needed emergency resuscitation . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro , left , celebrates as he runs past angelo basinas and antonios nikopolidis , of greece after scoring the winning goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and japan in frankfurt , germany sunday june 19 , 2005 . french icon michel platini once remarked that japan play a brand of " future football " .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

" reckoned in euros , the price of crude oil has leapt about 60 percent since january .
we 're really facing a crisis , " said lorenzo codogno , an economist at the bank of america . by comparison , the cost of a barrel of crude oil in new york has jumped just 38 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the one hand , the easing off of the euro , now worth about $ 1.20 as against 1.35 in january , has had a positive result , making eurozone exporters more competitive . " but this positive effect will not really be felt for some months while consumers are affected almost immediately by price rises of imported products , " codogno said . german inflation figures a good example came on friday with the publication in germany of inflation figures for june .
residents of north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany , have seen their petrol prices rise 6.6 percent in a year while domestic heating oil have leapt 38.7 percent . furthermore , british airways has announced that from monday it is increasing the surcharge on its flights to offset surging fuel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british airways is planning to increase fuel surcharges what could be better guaranteed to stifle consumption in europe and its biggest economy , germany , just as the winds of recovery were starting to blow ? the french government has just revised downwards its growth targets for this year to roughly two percent .
the national statistics institute -lrb- insee -rrb- reckons that the figure will be even lower at 1.5 per cent . french prime minister dominique de villepin admitted last week that the historic high of $ 60 a barrel was " a heavy burden on us and our economy . " all eyes on ecb all eyes are now fixed on the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
speculation on the possible lowering of interest rates is one of the chief reasons for the annual slackening of the single currency . the recent lowering of interest rates by the swedish central bank and the vote by two of the nine members of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee in favour of monetary relaxation has stepped up pressure on the ecb . this month , german economy minister wolfgang clement urged the ecb to follow the swedish example . for the moment , the bank has turned a deaf ear .
its monetary policy is already " extremely accommodating , " said christian noyer , governor of the bank of france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet however , it has softened its tone of late and has stopped insisting that lower rates are not an option as its president jean-claude trichet -lrb- photo -rrb- said in may . the ecb 's governors " are clearly not ready to act just at the moment .
but if the indicators continue to be bad , they are going to revise their estimates for growth and inflation in september and perhaps cut the key interest rate , which has been set at two percent since june 2003 , " codogno said . the ecb is in a difficult position because the rise in crude oil prices while affecting growth , also fuels inflation .
it is the bank 's first job to keep inflation in check . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

" reckoned in euros , the price of crude oil has leapt about 60 percent since january .
we 're really facing a crisis , " said lorenzo codogno , an economist at the bank of america . by comparison , the cost of a barrel of crude oil in new york has jumped just 38 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the one hand , the easing off of the euro , now worth about $ 1.20 as against 1.35 in january , has had a positive result , making eurozone exporters more competitive . " but this positive effect will not really be felt for some months while consumers are affected almost immediately by price rises of imported products , " codogno said . german inflation figures a good example came on friday with the publication in germany of inflation figures for june .
residents of north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany , have seen their petrol prices rise 6.6 percent in a year while domestic heating oil have leapt 38.7 percent . furthermore , british airways has announced that from monday it is increasing the surcharge on its flights to offset surging fuel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british airways is planning to increase fuel surcharges what could be better guaranteed to stifle consumption in europe and its biggest economy , germany , just as the winds of recovery were starting to blow ? the french government has just revised downwards its growth targets for this year to roughly two percent .
the national statistics institute -lrb- insee -rrb- reckons that the figure will be even lower at 1.5 per cent . french prime minister dominique de villepin admitted last week that the historic high of $ 60 a barrel was " a heavy burden on us and our economy . " all eyes on ecb all eyes are now fixed on the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
speculation on the possible lowering of interest rates is one of the chief reasons for the annual slackening of the single currency . the recent lowering of interest rates by the swedish central bank and the vote by two of the nine members of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee in favour of monetary relaxation has stepped up pressure on the ecb . this month , german economy minister wolfgang clement urged the ecb to follow the swedish example . for the moment , the bank has turned a deaf ear .
its monetary policy is already " extremely accommodating , " said christian noyer , governor of the bank of france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet however , it has softened its tone of late and has stopped insisting that lower rates are not an option as its president jean-claude trichet -lrb- photo -rrb- said in may . the ecb 's governors " are clearly not ready to act just at the moment .
but if the indicators continue to be bad , they are going to revise their estimates for growth and inflation in september and perhaps cut the key interest rate , which has been set at two percent since june 2003 , " codogno said . the ecb is in a difficult position because the rise in crude oil prices while affecting growth , also fuels inflation .
it is the bank 's first job to keep inflation in check . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .

" from the new president ahmadinejad we are waiting for clear words on human rights and the nuclear issue .

" " we will work hard , with our eu partners and bilaterally , to encourage action by iran in these areas so that iran can return to its rightful place in the international community , " straw said . but iranian spokesman asefi hit back . " the europeans and mr straw should give their nuclear proposal as soon as possible , which includes iran 's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes , " he said .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 .

the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

11 , 2001 suicide hijackers said he wants to sue german authorities for preventing him from finishing his studies . abdelghani mzoudi 's ordeal is behind him now , but the former electrical engineering student wants compensation from the german state as he was not able to finish his studies . a german federal court confirmed mzoudi 's acquittal this month , but city authorities maintained that he was a threat , and gave him two weeks to leave the country . mzoudi , who was a friend of sept .
11 plot leader mohamed atta , is now back in his native country , morocco . " it was a tough experience , " he told reuters .
" instead of apologizing after they found out i was innocent , german authorities expelled me . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moroccan abdelghani mzoudi , second right , stands with his suitcase in a row of unidentified passengers in front of a check-in counter at the airport hanover-langenhagen , germany , on early tuesday june 21 , 2005 .
" when my lawyer was here was talked about the possibility of suing german authorities and we will do it because they did not authoize me to finish my studies one year before graduation , " mzoudi said in an interview with the news agency . the 32-year-old arrived in germany in 1993 to study electrical engineering in hamburg , but was arrested in october 2002 on suspicion that he and fellow moroccan , mounir el motassadeq , provided logistical support to atta and other members of the hamburg al qaeda cell . on sunday , a senator in the city state of hamburg responded angrily to news of mzoudi 's plans to sue the german state . it was not germany which robbed mzoudi of his future prospects , senator udo nagel told focus news magazine .

estaban cambiasso 's spot-kick winner sets up a south american showpiece on wednesday . inter milan midfielder cambiasso came up with the winner after mexico defender ricardo osorio 's effort was saved by argentina keeper german lux . this ill-tempered semi-final had to be decided by spot kicks after the sides were deadlocked at 1-1 , carlos salcido putting mexico ahead in the 14th minute of extra time , with luciano figueroa leveling six minutes later . the game was scarred by the first red cards of the competition , with argentina 's javier saviola sent off in the 90th minute and mexico 's rafael marquez following him off the pitch in injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico , missing defender aaron galindo and midfielder salvador carmona , who were sent home in disgrace on tuesday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolene , welcomed back marquez .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .
" everyone our age knows the music we sing , and hearing them sung in another language takes a lot of getting used to . " zhang xiaoying -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-chinese business relations boom managers from china and germany met in berlin to discuss business opportunities .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock .

it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ?

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.06.2005 opinion : six months after the tsunami großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , there is still a lot of work to be done six months have passed since a violent tsunami rose from the indian ocean , bringing death and destruction to many coastal areas .
aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 26.06.2005 opinion : six months after the tsunami großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six months after the tsunami , there is still a lot of work to be done six months have passed since a violent tsunami rose from the indian ocean , bringing death and destruction to many coastal areas .
aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .
but , how exactly is the money going to be distributed ?

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

" from the new president ahmadinejad we are waiting for clear words on human rights and the nuclear issue .

dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies thinks it has a lot to do with reporting attitudes and favoritism . it was either the most uninformed or patronizing comment i have heard so far during the confederations cup .
" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .
and wolf-dieter poschmann would probably have needed emergency resuscitation . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro , left , celebrates as he runs past angelo basinas and antonios nikopolidis , of greece after scoring the winning goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and japan in frankfurt , germany sunday june 19 , 2005 . french icon michel platini once remarked that japan play a brand of " future football " .
maybe it 's time our commentators wake up to the fact that this future may not be as far off as many think . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

" reckoned in euros , the price of crude oil has leapt about 60 percent since january .
we 're really facing a crisis , " said lorenzo codogno , an economist at the bank of america . by comparison , the cost of a barrel of crude oil in new york has jumped just 38 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the one hand , the easing off of the euro , now worth about $ 1.20 as against 1.35 in january , has had a positive result , making eurozone exporters more competitive . " but this positive effect will not really be felt for some months while consumers are affected almost immediately by price rises of imported products , " codogno said . german inflation figures a good example came on friday with the publication in germany of inflation figures for june .
residents of north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany , have seen their petrol prices rise 6.6 percent in a year while domestic heating oil have leapt 38.7 percent . furthermore , british airways has announced that from monday it is increasing the surcharge on its flights to offset surging fuel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british airways is planning to increase fuel surcharges what could be better guaranteed to stifle consumption in europe and its biggest economy , germany , just as the winds of recovery were starting to blow ? the french government has just revised downwards its growth targets for this year to roughly two percent .
the national statistics institute -lrb- insee -rrb- reckons that the figure will be even lower at 1.5 per cent . french prime minister dominique de villepin admitted last week that the historic high of $ 60 a barrel was " a heavy burden on us and our economy . " all eyes on ecb all eyes are now fixed on the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
speculation on the possible lowering of interest rates is one of the chief reasons for the annual slackening of the single currency . the recent lowering of interest rates by the swedish central bank and the vote by two of the nine members of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee in favour of monetary relaxation has stepped up pressure on the ecb . this month , german economy minister wolfgang clement urged the ecb to follow the swedish example . for the moment , the bank has turned a deaf ear .
its monetary policy is already " extremely accommodating , " said christian noyer , governor of the bank of france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet however , it has softened its tone of late and has stopped insisting that lower rates are not an option as its president jean-claude trichet -lrb- photo -rrb- said in may . the ecb 's governors " are clearly not ready to act just at the moment .
but if the indicators continue to be bad , they are going to revise their estimates for growth and inflation in september and perhaps cut the key interest rate , which has been set at two percent since june 2003 , " codogno said . the ecb is in a difficult position because the rise in crude oil prices while affecting growth , also fuels inflation .
it is the bank 's first job to keep inflation in check . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 26.06.2005 wake up and smell the sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan matched brazil goal for goal and tackle for tackle in group b why were so many people at the confed cup surprised by the fact that japan could play soccer ?
dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies thinks it has a lot to do with reporting attitudes and favoritism . it was either the most uninformed or patronizing comment i have heard so far during the confederations cup .
" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .
and wolf-dieter poschmann would probably have needed emergency resuscitation . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro , left , celebrates as he runs past angelo basinas and antonios nikopolidis , of greece after scoring the winning goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and japan in frankfurt , germany sunday june 19 , 2005 . french icon michel platini once remarked that japan play a brand of " future football " .
maybe it 's time our commentators wake up to the fact that this future may not be as far off as many think . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .
coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance .

estaban cambiasso 's spot-kick winner sets up a south american showpiece on wednesday . inter milan midfielder cambiasso came up with the winner after mexico defender ricardo osorio 's effort was saved by argentina keeper german lux . this ill-tempered semi-final had to be decided by spot kicks after the sides were deadlocked at 1-1 , carlos salcido putting mexico ahead in the 14th minute of extra time , with luciano figueroa leveling six minutes later . the game was scarred by the first red cards of the competition , with argentina 's javier saviola sent off in the 90th minute and mexico 's rafael marquez following him off the pitch in injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico , missing defender aaron galindo and midfielder salvador carmona , who were sent home in disgrace on tuesday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolene , welcomed back marquez .
but the barcelona star 's first major imprint on the game was not a positive one - a cynical tackle on javier saviola in the 21st minute securing him his first yellow card . the first half was evenly balanced as stoic work by both sets of defenses meant goal scoring opportunities were thin on the ground . chances few and far between argentina had to wait until one minute before the break for their best chance when only mexico midfielder gonzalo pineda 's quick reflexes denied juan sorin 's close range shot into an open goal .
mexico had earlier come close to breaking the midfield deadlock with argentina keeper german lux only able to deflect sinha 's shot behind his line for a corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on 36 minutes ramon morales was brought down in the box but italian referee roberto rosetti brushed aside mexico 's claims for a penalty , much to the chagrin of coach ricardo la volpe , looking as cool as anything in jeans on the bench . argentina , wearing black armbands in memory of a young goalkeeper who died on saturday , started the second half brightly with luciano figueroa putting a purposeful header over oswaldo sanchez ' bar . woodwork denies mexico up at the other end sinha , with his right hand bandaged , unleashed a shot from just outside the box which , with lux beaten , rocketed off the right post .
the brazilian-born midfielder has excelled in this competition .
what he makes up for in stature- - he was the shortest player on the pitch - he more than makes up for in ability . mexico goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez is another who has caught the eye this month in germany , and he produced a great save to keep out argentina defender fabricio colocchini 's 58th minute effort .
the mop-haired deportivo la coruna defender was then booked in the 69th minute after a thuggish challenge on morales , who had to be stretchered off in evident distress . players see red as frustrations boil over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ill-tempered game then took on a reddish hue with saviola first to feel rosetti 's wrath when he lashed out at gonzalo pineda - the monaco player misses wednesday 's final . marquez was sent packing when he picked up his second yellow for a nasty challenge on pablo aimar . in the 14th minute of extra time salcido 's deflected shot from the left hopped over lux and into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but figueroa leveled with his fourth goal of the competition , juggling the ball on his heel before shooting under sanchez from point blank range , to leave penalties the only answer with cambriasso holding his nerve to end mexico 's 21 match unbeaten run . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

estaban cambiasso 's spot-kick winner sets up a south american showpiece on wednesday . inter milan midfielder cambiasso came up with the winner after mexico defender ricardo osorio 's effort was saved by argentina keeper german lux . this ill-tempered semi-final had to be decided by spot kicks after the sides were deadlocked at 1-1 , carlos salcido putting mexico ahead in the 14th minute of extra time , with luciano figueroa leveling six minutes later . the game was scarred by the first red cards of the competition , with argentina 's javier saviola sent off in the 90th minute and mexico 's rafael marquez following him off the pitch in injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico , missing defender aaron galindo and midfielder salvador carmona , who were sent home in disgrace on tuesday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolene , welcomed back marquez .
but the barcelona star 's first major imprint on the game was not a positive one - a cynical tackle on javier saviola in the 21st minute securing him his first yellow card . the first half was evenly balanced as stoic work by both sets of defenses meant goal scoring opportunities were thin on the ground . chances few and far between argentina had to wait until one minute before the break for their best chance when only mexico midfielder gonzalo pineda 's quick reflexes denied juan sorin 's close range shot into an open goal .
mexico had earlier come close to breaking the midfield deadlock with argentina keeper german lux only able to deflect sinha 's shot behind his line for a corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on 36 minutes ramon morales was brought down in the box but italian referee roberto rosetti brushed aside mexico 's claims for a penalty , much to the chagrin of coach ricardo la volpe , looking as cool as anything in jeans on the bench . argentina , wearing black armbands in memory of a young goalkeeper who died on saturday , started the second half brightly with luciano figueroa putting a purposeful header over oswaldo sanchez ' bar . woodwork denies mexico up at the other end sinha , with his right hand bandaged , unleashed a shot from just outside the box which , with lux beaten , rocketed off the right post .
the brazilian-born midfielder has excelled in this competition .
what he makes up for in stature- - he was the shortest player on the pitch - he more than makes up for in ability . mexico goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez is another who has caught the eye this month in germany , and he produced a great save to keep out argentina defender fabricio colocchini 's 58th minute effort .
the mop-haired deportivo la coruna defender was then booked in the 69th minute after a thuggish challenge on morales , who had to be stretchered off in evident distress . players see red as frustrations boil over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ill-tempered game then took on a reddish hue with saviola first to feel rosetti 's wrath when he lashed out at gonzalo pineda - the monaco player misses wednesday 's final . marquez was sent packing when he picked up his second yellow for a nasty challenge on pablo aimar . in the 14th minute of extra time salcido 's deflected shot from the left hopped over lux and into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but figueroa leveled with his fourth goal of the competition , juggling the ball on his heel before shooting under sanchez from point blank range , to leave penalties the only answer with cambriasso holding his nerve to end mexico 's 21 match unbeaten run . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .
but before the boys kick-start their international career , they 'll continue entertaining the german fans with their chinese covers of the beatles , new german wave and classics from the 1980s . so how do the audiences react to hearing music they grew up with reworked into chinese ? " there was a couple in the first row at one of our recent gigs who could n't stop laughing , " said häring .
" everyone our age knows the music we sing , and hearing them sung in another language takes a lot of getting used to .

aid came flooding in from all over the world , but there are still many victims in need . the worst natural disaster for several decades claimed 220,000 lives and wreaked havoc along the indian ocean coastline .
the rich and poor , the luxury thai resorts and poor southern indian fishing villages were crushed under its weight .
it made no distinctions as it destroyed rebel camps in northern sumatra and the army troops attacking them . in the overwhelming horror which the tsunami left in its wake , regional problems and conflicts paled to relative insignificance .
the images which were beamed out around the world touched the hearts of people tens of thousands of kilometers away and led them to dig into their pockets as they had never done before .
rarely had the bond between north and south been as close as in the immediate aftermath of the tsunami . there was even a distant hope that the flood waters would wash away some of the trouble already present in the region , such as the civil wars in aceh and sri lanka , and corruption and mismanagement in almost all affected countries . short-lived good intentions in the weeks following the tsunami , much lip service was paid to the notion that local survivors had suffered enough .
negotiations on ending the civil war in aceh began and in sri lanka , tamil tiger and singhalese representatives met to discuss how best to spend the aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : devestated coastal area in aceh they agreed to get the money to those in need as quickly as possible without tangling it up in red tape or losing it in the normal labyrinths of corruption and mismanagement . but now , half a year on , local and international aid workers have done their bit , the majority of designated money has been paid into united nations accounts , many small-scale , grassroots projects have been implemented , and the indian ocean will soon get an early warning system . that , however , is not the whole picture . aid workers in indonesia 's aceh are subject to changing residency rules imposed by local authorities , their freedom of movement is restricted and the civil war continues . and in sri lanka , the dispute about how to spend the aid money has already brought the coalition government to its knees and led to violent conflicts . although india pledged swift and non-bureaucratic assistance , many people are still waiting for the authorities there to make good on that promise . aid funds are accumulating in bank accounts , there are constant reports of corruption and many victims who still have n't received any money feel as though they have been cheated . business as usual bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thailand is keen to lure tourists back to its beaches meanwhile , thailand 's beaches , with their slew of new hotels and tourist-filled bars , are testimony to the ability of some to leave the past well and truly behind them .
daily life has returned and with it the same local problems which dogged the region before the giant wave stuck . much of the money is still in the bank , the emergency aid work is complete but in most regions reconstruction has not yet really begun .
on balance , it is now clear that good will and solidarity are not enough , and that politicians have to make sure help is delivered where it is most needed .
it must take priority over local conflicts and spending should be controlled by an independent body . politicians in the flood regions owe that to their populations , where many people are still traumatized , just as they owe it to the people in far off places who sent millions of euros worth of aid . sybille golte-schröder -lrb- tkw -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de an endeavor that needs time and money the german government has generously pledged € 500 million -lrb- $ 653 million -rrb- over the next three to five years for long-term rebuilding in tsunami-ravaged south asia .

probably not .
but that 's exactly what " nightmare of the red chamber " does .
their fans love it - once they 've gotten used to it . " dream of the red chamber " was written by chinese novelist , tsao-hsueh-chin in the 18th century .
today it 's still seen in china as the greatest of its novels , a reworking of the romeo-and-juliet love story and a portrait of one of the world 's great civilizations . but what about " nightmare of the red chamber " ?
well , it 's a berlin band made up of four sinologists - andreas steen , volker häring , peter merker , andreas kraus - and filipino bass player enrico dalisay .
he 's the only member of the line-up who 's not a chinese studies expert - not that that stopped him from playing with rebel chinese rocker cui jian in the 1980s . a bit of a nightmare bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they 're not without their admirers , but so far , none of the members have given up their day jobs .
drummer andreas steen is a lecturer in chinese history and literature at the free university in berlin .
in spring 2003 , he became a founding member of germany 's one and only chinese rock band , " nightmare of the red chamber . " " in china , not that many people are into rock , " he said .
" and above all , it 's a bit of a headache for the government .
so we decided it would be fitting to call ourselves the ' nightmare of the red chamber . " ' pop as social critique their revamped version of the schmaltzy 1993 chinese hit " xiaofang " certainly gave a lot of chinese a headache .
the band are quick to stress that they should be taken with a pinch of salt , but they 're also aware that in china , rock music can serve a serious political purpose as veiled criticism of the country 's existing social problems . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : take the track " a piece of red cloth " by the legendary cui jian -lrb- photo -rrb- , a former trumpet player with the beijing symphony orchestra now touted as the godfather of chinese rock . " that day you took a piece of red cloth / covered my eyes and covered the sky / you asked me what i saw , " he sings . " in chinese history , red has a number of meanings , " steen said .
" it 's a traditional wedding color , and it 's the color of the communist party .
so with this in mind , you can read his song on two levels .
it could be a romantic love song , and it could be a political allusion . " silencing subversive stars chances are it 's the latter .
on tiananmen square in 1989 , 15 days before the crackdown , jian performed " a piece of red cloth " with his eyes covered by a red cloth . his appearances during this turbulent era were so inflammatory that the chinese authorities unofficially banned cui jian well into the 1990s . he 'd become an icon of a counter-culture , and the government maintained a continuing crackdown on unauthorized " underground " performances . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but times have changed .
these days , in the new , " open " china , music has long been stripped of its rebellious edge .
in a market economy , success is what sells - and today , chinese teenagers prefer the gangtai pop from hong kong and taiwan - otherwise known as cantopop . " it 's just more acceptable amongst the population , " steen said .
" the chinese tend to prefer the southern chinese style , which is more melodious and tranquil .
a chinese friend once told me that the reason why the chinese do n't like hectic rock music is because the country is so overpopulated and life is already hectic enough . " he also pointed out that it would be a mistake to draw over-hasty conclusions . " it would n't be fair to say that a certain type of music is n't popular in china because it 's repressed , " he said .
" rock is just very western . " fans who " ca n't stop giggling " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as it happens , the chinese embassy in berlin has already shown an interest in " nightmare of the red chamber . "
that 's encouragement enough for the band to start planning a concert in the former german colony qingdao .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 26.06.2005 wake up and smell the sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan matched brazil goal for goal and tackle for tackle in group b why were so many people at the confed cup surprised by the fact that japan could play soccer ?
dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies thinks it has a lot to do with reporting attitudes and favoritism . it was either the most uninformed or patronizing comment i have heard so far during the confederations cup .
" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .
and wolf-dieter poschmann would probably have needed emergency resuscitation . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro , left , celebrates as he runs past angelo basinas and antonios nikopolidis , of greece after scoring the winning goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and japan in frankfurt , germany sunday june 19 , 2005 . french icon michel platini once remarked that japan play a brand of " future football " .
maybe it 's time our commentators wake up to the fact that this future may not be as far off as many think . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .
coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance .

" reckoned in euros , the price of crude oil has leapt about 60 percent since january .
we 're really facing a crisis , " said lorenzo codogno , an economist at the bank of america . by comparison , the cost of a barrel of crude oil in new york has jumped just 38 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the one hand , the easing off of the euro , now worth about $ 1.20 as against 1.35 in january , has had a positive result , making eurozone exporters more competitive . " but this positive effect will not really be felt for some months while consumers are affected almost immediately by price rises of imported products , " codogno said . german inflation figures a good example came on friday with the publication in germany of inflation figures for june .
residents of north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany , have seen their petrol prices rise 6.6 percent in a year while domestic heating oil have leapt 38.7 percent . furthermore , british airways has announced that from monday it is increasing the surcharge on its flights to offset surging fuel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british airways is planning to increase fuel surcharges what could be better guaranteed to stifle consumption in europe and its biggest economy , germany , just as the winds of recovery were starting to blow ? the french government has just revised downwards its growth targets for this year to roughly two percent .
the national statistics institute -lrb- insee -rrb- reckons that the figure will be even lower at 1.5 per cent . french prime minister dominique de villepin admitted last week that the historic high of $ 60 a barrel was " a heavy burden on us and our economy . " all eyes on ecb all eyes are now fixed on the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
speculation on the possible lowering of interest rates is one of the chief reasons for the annual slackening of the single currency . the recent lowering of interest rates by the swedish central bank and the vote by two of the nine members of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee in favour of monetary relaxation has stepped up pressure on the ecb . this month , german economy minister wolfgang clement urged the ecb to follow the swedish example . for the moment , the bank has turned a deaf ear .
its monetary policy is already " extremely accommodating , " said christian noyer , governor of the bank of france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet however , it has softened its tone of late and has stopped insisting that lower rates are not an option as its president jean-claude trichet -lrb- photo -rrb- said in may . the ecb 's governors " are clearly not ready to act just at the moment .
but if the indicators continue to be bad , they are going to revise their estimates for growth and inflation in september and perhaps cut the key interest rate , which has been set at two percent since june 2003 , " codogno said . the ecb is in a difficult position because the rise in crude oil prices while affecting growth , also fuels inflation .
it is the bank 's first job to keep inflation in check . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

" from the new president ahmadinejad we are waiting for clear words on human rights and the nuclear issue .

" " we will work hard , with our eu partners and bilaterally , to encourage action by iran in these areas so that iran can return to its rightful place in the international community , " straw said . but iranian spokesman asefi hit back . " the europeans and mr straw should give their nuclear proposal as soon as possible , which includes iran 's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes , " he said .

" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .
and wolf-dieter poschmann would probably have needed emergency resuscitation . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro , left , celebrates as he runs past angelo basinas and antonios nikopolidis , of greece after scoring the winning goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and japan in frankfurt , germany sunday june 19 , 2005 . french icon michel platini once remarked that japan play a brand of " future football " .
maybe it 's time our commentators wake up to the fact that this future may not be as far off as many think . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .
coach ricardo la volpe 's side will have to play more convincingly to advance .
-lrb- june 16 , 2005 -rrb- japanese knock greek gods from pedestal a year ago , greece 's euro 2004 heroes were being revered as gods after pulling off an amazing european championship victory .

" the nuclear issue is a part of a macro policy , and our position will not change with the change of a president , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . but he added : " with this election , the islamic republic of iran is more capable of confronting challenges , and the europeans have to take this into consideration . " nervous reactions the eu reacted nervously to ahmadinejad 's shock victory , as well as the humiliating defeat for moderate cleric akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who was widely viewed as a more liberal negotiating partner . franco frattini , european commissioner for justice and security issues , said the eu could " freeze " talks with iran unless ahmadinejad made an early commitment to talks with the eu-3 of germany , france and britain on the nuclear issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " the reformists have suffered a worrying defeat , " said frattini .
" from the new president ahmadinejad we are waiting for clear words on human rights and the nuclear issue .
but if the replies are negative , the european union will have no choice but to freeze dialogue with iran , " frattini told italy 's la repubblica newspaper . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with britain , france and germany , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . " we will not give up our right , " asefi said , repeating iran 's demand to end the freeze on fuel cycle work .

where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .

as the world celebrates the global organization , members grumble that it urgently needs reform , but disagree on exactly what that means . more than 60 years ago , us president franklin d. roosevelt realized that the world needed a strong international body to replace the slowly dying league of nations .
he approached british prime minister winston churchill and after , china and the soviet union .
after meeting in washington in 1944 , the " big four " came up with a plan and a year later , the un was born when the new body 's charter was signed by the representatives of 50 countries on june 26 , 1945 . " we kept in mind that germany was only defeated because of the combined might of countries working for the same thing , " said then-secretary of state edward stettinius , sent by roosevelt to san francisco in 1945 to sign the document creating the un .
" and we knew that lasting freedom would only be possible when united nations use their power to create it .
the united nations had to be . " now six decades later , its membership has reached almost 190 nations ; its members send troops under un banners on peacekeeping mission around the globe ; its staff raise alerts to natural and man-made disasters and coordinates relief for victims and the poor of the world . and these days , a debate over its very core is being played out : reforming the 15-member security council . " we want in " in the next month , the foreign ministers of brazil , germany , india and japan known as the group of four will set a date for the un general assembly to vote on their groundbreaking resolution .
un secretary general kofi annan wants a decision before the end of the summer . the resolution supports expanding the security council to better represent the state of the world 60 years after world war ii ended .
if approved , it would increase the number of seats by 10 , including six more permanent seats to the five that currently exist .
the group of four would expect to get four of the permanent seats . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany foreign minister joschka fischer with un secretary general kofi annan " the structure of the security council has not changed in 40 years , " said german foreign minister joschka fischer .
" i think it is high time that it begins to reflect the current state of the world today . " so far , it seems likely that the resolution could pass as many un nations support the initiative , except for one very powerful member , the us . thorny relationship the us declined to join the ill-fated league of nations , the un 's predecessor , because of a lack of veto power . so it is no wonder that the us is not supportive of its power on the security council being diluted - currently veto power belongs to the five permanent members of the security council , the us , russia , france , england and china .
the current american administration , never particularly friendly to the international organization , meanwhile has created its own proposal for fewer new seats and those going to nations who display a clear commitment to democracy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president george w. bush with the un 's kofi annan the us has also signaled that it sees reforming an inefficient and corrupt bureaucracy as more urgent than expanding the body 's core structure , so much so that last week , the us house of representatives passed a bill that would reduce the us 's financial contribution to the un by 50 percent if reforms are not taken . " our goal is massive un reform , " said nicolas burns of the state department .
" and if we back down , we will not only lose our credibility in the un but also around the world .

" from the new president ahmadinejad we are waiting for clear words on human rights and the nuclear issue .
but if the replies are negative , the european union will have no choice but to freeze dialogue with iran , " frattini told italy 's la repubblica newspaper . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with britain , france and germany , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .

" " we will work hard , with our eu partners and bilaterally , to encourage action by iran in these areas so that iran can return to its rightful place in the international community , " straw said . but iranian spokesman asefi hit back . " the europeans and mr straw should give their nuclear proposal as soon as possible , which includes iran 's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes , " he said .

" the nuclear issue is a part of a macro policy , and our position will not change with the change of a president , " iranian foreign ministry spokesman hamid reza asefi told reporters . but he added : " with this election , the islamic republic of iran is more capable of confronting challenges , and the europeans have to take this into consideration . " nervous reactions the eu reacted nervously to ahmadinejad 's shock victory , as well as the humiliating defeat for moderate cleric akbar hashemi rafsanjani , who was widely viewed as a more liberal negotiating partner . franco frattini , european commissioner for justice and security issues , said the eu could " freeze " talks with iran unless ahmadinejad made an early commitment to talks with the eu-3 of germany , france and britain on the nuclear issue . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franco frattini " the reformists have suffered a worrying defeat , " said frattini .
" from the new president ahmadinejad we are waiting for clear words on human rights and the nuclear issue .
but if the replies are negative , the european union will have no choice but to freeze dialogue with iran , " frattini told italy 's la repubblica newspaper . iran has frozen its fuel cycle work and has entered into long-term talks with britain , france and germany , who are trying to convince iran to abandon such activities altogether in a " libya-style deal " that offers incentives in return . at the core of the nuclear issue is iran 's ambition to make its own nuclear fuel by enriching uranium , a process that can also be used to make the core of a nuclear bomb .
iran insists it only wants to generate electricity . " we will not give up our right , " asefi said , repeating iran 's demand to end the freeze on fuel cycle work .
" we will reach bright results through negotiations . " german foreign minister joschka fischer said he is expecting business as usual when the next round of talks resume . " germany expects that talks between france , the united kingdom , germany and eu foreign policy chief -lrb- javier -rrb- solana will continue with the new president under the terms of the paris agreement , " said fischer .

" " we will work hard , with our eu partners and bilaterally , to encourage action by iran in these areas so that iran can return to its rightful place in the international community , " straw said . but iranian spokesman asefi hit back . " the europeans and mr straw should give their nuclear proposal as soon as possible , which includes iran 's right to nuclear technology for peaceful purposes , " he said . " they should stop making inappropriate comments .
they should send respectful congratulatory messages to iran .

" reckoned in euros , the price of crude oil has leapt about 60 percent since january .
we 're really facing a crisis , " said lorenzo codogno , an economist at the bank of america . by comparison , the cost of a barrel of crude oil in new york has jumped just 38 percent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the one hand , the easing off of the euro , now worth about $ 1.20 as against 1.35 in january , has had a positive result , making eurozone exporters more competitive .

residents of north rhine-westphalia , the most populous state in germany , have seen their petrol prices rise 6.6 percent in a year while domestic heating oil have leapt 38.7 percent . furthermore , british airways has announced that from monday it is increasing the surcharge on its flights to offset surging fuel costs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british airways is planning to increase fuel surcharges what could be better guaranteed to stifle consumption in europe and its biggest economy , germany , just as the winds of recovery were starting to blow ? the french government has just revised downwards its growth targets for this year to roughly two percent .
the national statistics institute -lrb- insee -rrb- reckons that the figure will be even lower at 1.5 per cent . french prime minister dominique de villepin admitted last week that the historic high of $ 60 a barrel was " a heavy burden on us and our economy . " all eyes on ecb all eyes are now fixed on the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
speculation on the possible lowering of interest rates is one of the chief reasons for the annual slackening of the single currency . the recent lowering of interest rates by the swedish central bank and the vote by two of the nine members of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee in favour of monetary relaxation has stepped up pressure on the ecb . this month , german economy minister wolfgang clement urged the ecb to follow the swedish example . for the moment , the bank has turned a deaf ear .
its monetary policy is already " extremely accommodating , " said christian noyer , governor of the bank of france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-claude trichet however , it has softened its tone of late and has stopped insisting that lower rates are not an option as its president jean-claude trichet -lrb- photo -rrb- said in may . the ecb 's governors " are clearly not ready to act just at the moment .
but if the indicators continue to be bad , they are going to revise their estimates for growth and inflation in september and perhaps cut the key interest rate , which has been set at two percent since june 2003 , " codogno said . the ecb is in a difficult position because the rise in crude oil prices while affecting growth , also fuels inflation .
it is the bank 's first job to keep inflation in check . dw staff / afp -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder wants oil price stemmed continuing his tour of the region , german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday called on the persian gulf countries to stop oil price increases by pumping more .

but the barcelona star 's first major imprint on the game was not a positive one - a cynical tackle on javier saviola in the 21st minute securing him his first yellow card . the first half was evenly balanced as stoic work by both sets of defenses meant goal scoring opportunities were thin on the ground . chances few and far between argentina had to wait until one minute before the break for their best chance when only mexico midfielder gonzalo pineda 's quick reflexes denied juan sorin 's close range shot into an open goal .
mexico had earlier come close to breaking the midfield deadlock with argentina keeper german lux only able to deflect sinha 's shot behind his line for a corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on 36 minutes ramon morales was brought down in the box but italian referee roberto rosetti brushed aside mexico 's claims for a penalty , much to the chagrin of coach ricardo la volpe , looking as cool as anything in jeans on the bench . argentina , wearing black armbands in memory of a young goalkeeper who died on saturday , started the second half brightly with luciano figueroa putting a purposeful header over oswaldo sanchez ' bar . woodwork denies mexico up at the other end sinha , with his right hand bandaged , unleashed a shot from just outside the box which , with lux beaten , rocketed off the right post .
the brazilian-born midfielder has excelled in this competition .
what he makes up for in stature- - he was the shortest player on the pitch - he more than makes up for in ability . mexico goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez is another who has caught the eye this month in germany , and he produced a great save to keep out argentina defender fabricio colocchini 's 58th minute effort .
the mop-haired deportivo la coruna defender was then booked in the 69th minute after a thuggish challenge on morales , who had to be stretchered off in evident distress . players see red as frustrations boil over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ill-tempered game then took on a reddish hue with saviola first to feel rosetti 's wrath when he lashed out at gonzalo pineda - the monaco player misses wednesday 's final . marquez was sent packing when he picked up his second yellow for a nasty challenge on pablo aimar . in the 14th minute of extra time salcido 's deflected shot from the left hopped over lux and into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but figueroa leveled with his fourth goal of the competition , juggling the ball on his heel before shooting under sanchez from point blank range , to leave penalties the only answer with cambriasso holding his nerve to end mexico 's 21 match unbeaten run . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

estaban cambiasso 's spot-kick winner sets up a south american showpiece on wednesday . inter milan midfielder cambiasso came up with the winner after mexico defender ricardo osorio 's effort was saved by argentina keeper german lux . this ill-tempered semi-final had to be decided by spot kicks after the sides were deadlocked at 1-1 , carlos salcido putting mexico ahead in the 14th minute of extra time , with luciano figueroa leveling six minutes later . the game was scarred by the first red cards of the competition , with argentina 's javier saviola sent off in the 90th minute and mexico 's rafael marquez following him off the pitch in injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico , missing defender aaron galindo and midfielder salvador carmona , who were sent home in disgrace on tuesday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolene , welcomed back marquez .
but the barcelona star 's first major imprint on the game was not a positive one - a cynical tackle on javier saviola in the 21st minute securing him his first yellow card . the first half was evenly balanced as stoic work by both sets of defenses meant goal scoring opportunities were thin on the ground . chances few and far between argentina had to wait until one minute before the break for their best chance when only mexico midfielder gonzalo pineda 's quick reflexes denied juan sorin 's close range shot into an open goal .
mexico had earlier come close to breaking the midfield deadlock with argentina keeper german lux only able to deflect sinha 's shot behind his line for a corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on 36 minutes ramon morales was brought down in the box but italian referee roberto rosetti brushed aside mexico 's claims for a penalty , much to the chagrin of coach ricardo la volpe , looking as cool as anything in jeans on the bench . argentina , wearing black armbands in memory of a young goalkeeper who died on saturday , started the second half brightly with luciano figueroa putting a purposeful header over oswaldo sanchez ' bar . woodwork denies mexico up at the other end sinha , with his right hand bandaged , unleashed a shot from just outside the box which , with lux beaten , rocketed off the right post .
the brazilian-born midfielder has excelled in this competition .
what he makes up for in stature- - he was the shortest player on the pitch - he more than makes up for in ability . mexico goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez is another who has caught the eye this month in germany , and he produced a great save to keep out argentina defender fabricio colocchini 's 58th minute effort .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the 2005 confederations cup confed cup : from riyadh to the world germany lacking bricks in defensive wall the confederations cup comes to germany the mini-world cup kicks off world cup 2006 -pipe- 26.06.2005 wake up and smell the sake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan matched brazil goal for goal and tackle for tackle in group b why were so many people at the confed cup surprised by the fact that japan could play soccer ?
dw-world 's blog reporter nick amies thinks it has a lot to do with reporting attitudes and favoritism . it was either the most uninformed or patronizing comment i have heard so far during the confederations cup .
" japan is really a football nation , " german commentator wolf-dieter poschmann breathlessly exclaimed in disbelief after the asian cup champions had held brazil to a 2-2 draw in the all-important group b game on wednesday , narrowly missing out on a semi-final spot at the world champions ' expense on goal difference only .
" japan is really a football nation . "
where has poschmann been for the last ten years ?
probably salivating over established – and , more often than not , underperforming – european teams or sighing in sporting ecstasy over the brilliant but boringly consistent giants of the south american game .
these can only be the reasons for the almost catatonic shock that he went into when it became glaringly obvious that japan can actually play soccer at a high international level .
bildunterschrift : if european , and in general western , soccer commentators were not so fixated on the often disappointing performances of the big teams , audiences would have known that poschmann 's comments showed a remarkable lack of insight .
domestic j-league formed basis for success thanks in part to the continuing phenomenal success of the domestic j-league , which took the country by storm when it started in 1993 and which has gone on to be more than just a cash cow for fading western stars , japan have been on a steady and exciting rise for the past decade .
after narrowly missing out on a world cup finals debut in the us in 1994 due to a last minute iraqi equalizer in the play-off , japan finally made it to a world cup in france 1998 after beating iran .
they did n't make it out of the group stage , losing all three matches but their style and tactical play under french coach philippe troussier earned plaudits and some of the players , particularly hidetoshi nakata , fame and fortune .
world cup 2002 a historic step for co-hosts four years later , with the 2000 asian cup under their belts , japan co-hosted the 2002 world cup with south korea and won group h by beating russia -lrb- 1-0 -rrb- , tunisia -lrb- 2-0 -rrb- and drawing with belgium -lrb- 2-2 -rrb- . while their co-hosts got the headlines with their run to the semi-finals , japan 's elimination in the first knock-out round was not a disaster .
they had claimed their first points in a world cup finals tournament and their first-ever qualification for the second round , lost narrowly 1-0 to eventual third-placed turkey and played with style throughout .
they were also in good company : denmark , sweden , mexico and italy were among those who also went out at the same stage .
international stars and a wealth of talent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : japan 's hidetoshi nakata , left .
japan also showed that it could unearth talent through a well-organized scouting structure and that its future was indeed bright .
following in the footsteps of nakata -lrb- photo -rrb- , shinji ono became an international star with feyenoord in the netherlands and went on to win the asian footballer award for 2002 .
following the 2002 world cup , japan played in the 2003 confederations cup in france where shunsuke nakamura made his name as the next rising star , ending the tournament as japan 's top scorer .
japan were also the first team to qualify for the 2006 world cup finals in germany .
the 2004 asian cup winners beat north korea 2-0 to book their place . euro champs outclassed , world champs matched in this confederations cup , japan labored against mexico in their first game , losing a yawn-fest 1-2 .
but they out-classed european champions greece in the next game , although the profligacy in front of goal was embarrassing , and matched brazil for long periods of the final group b game with sweeping and rapid attacking moves .
in the end , if japan had scored a couple of the many chances they fluffed against the greeks , it would be they and not brazil who would be meeting germany in the semi-finals .
and wolf-dieter poschmann would probably have needed emergency resuscitation . bildunterschrift : japan 's masashi oguro , left , celebrates as he runs past angelo basinas and antonios nikopolidis , of greece after scoring the winning goal during the confederations cup group b soccer match between greece and japan in frankfurt , germany sunday june 19 , 2005 . french icon michel platini once remarked that japan play a brand of " future football " .
maybe it 's time our commentators wake up to the fact that this future may not be as far off as many think . nick amies , dw-world.de send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mexico yawns past japan mexico edged japan on a second-half goal in a slow-paced match that featured few highlights .

estaban cambiasso 's spot-kick winner sets up a south american showpiece on wednesday . inter milan midfielder cambiasso came up with the winner after mexico defender ricardo osorio 's effort was saved by argentina keeper german lux . this ill-tempered semi-final had to be decided by spot kicks after the sides were deadlocked at 1-1 , carlos salcido putting mexico ahead in the 14th minute of extra time , with luciano figueroa leveling six minutes later . the game was scarred by the first red cards of the competition , with argentina 's javier saviola sent off in the 90th minute and mexico 's rafael marquez following him off the pitch in injury time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mexico , missing defender aaron galindo and midfielder salvador carmona , who were sent home in disgrace on tuesday after testing positive for the banned steroid nandrolene , welcomed back marquez .
but the barcelona star 's first major imprint on the game was not a positive one - a cynical tackle on javier saviola in the 21st minute securing him his first yellow card . the first half was evenly balanced as stoic work by both sets of defenses meant goal scoring opportunities were thin on the ground . chances few and far between argentina had to wait until one minute before the break for their best chance when only mexico midfielder gonzalo pineda 's quick reflexes denied juan sorin 's close range shot into an open goal .
mexico had earlier come close to breaking the midfield deadlock with argentina keeper german lux only able to deflect sinha 's shot behind his line for a corner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on 36 minutes ramon morales was brought down in the box but italian referee roberto rosetti brushed aside mexico 's claims for a penalty , much to the chagrin of coach ricardo la volpe , looking as cool as anything in jeans on the bench . argentina , wearing black armbands in memory of a young goalkeeper who died on saturday , started the second half brightly with luciano figueroa putting a purposeful header over oswaldo sanchez ' bar . woodwork denies mexico up at the other end sinha , with his right hand bandaged , unleashed a shot from just outside the box which , with lux beaten , rocketed off the right post .
the brazilian-born midfielder has excelled in this competition .
what he makes up for in stature- - he was the shortest player on the pitch - he more than makes up for in ability . mexico goalkeeper oswaldo sanchez is another who has caught the eye this month in germany , and he produced a great save to keep out argentina defender fabricio colocchini 's 58th minute effort .
the mop-haired deportivo la coruna defender was then booked in the 69th minute after a thuggish challenge on morales , who had to be stretchered off in evident distress . players see red as frustrations boil over bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ill-tempered game then took on a reddish hue with saviola first to feel rosetti 's wrath when he lashed out at gonzalo pineda - the monaco player misses wednesday 's final . marquez was sent packing when he picked up his second yellow for a nasty challenge on pablo aimar . in the 14th minute of extra time salcido 's deflected shot from the left hopped over lux and into the back of the net . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : but figueroa leveled with his fourth goal of the competition , juggling the ball on his heel before shooting under sanchez from point blank range , to leave penalties the only answer with cambriasso holding his nerve to end mexico 's 21 match unbeaten run . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de mighty argentina confident against mexico argentina 's talented squad say they are ready to live up to their favorite 's tag and advertise their world cup claims against mexico in the second confederations cup semi-final hanover on sunday .

wearing little more than underpants and goggles , philip mccabe , 59 , failed to top the 1998 record set in the us of 87.5lb -lrb- 40kg -rrb- , or 350,000 bees .
after two hours on scales , he was forced to give up because of numb feet .
" the bees we have in ireland , this native black bee , is different than the one that holds the record , " he said .
' no stings ' mr mccabe , who is the head of the irish beekeepers association , said he suffered no stings in the stunt - held at cahir , co tipperary - until he jumped off the scales and was stung seven times .
dozens of people watched his attempt , which was to raise money for charitable causes in africa .
he told reporters he was not nervous ahead of the attempt beekeepers were on hand with six hives full of bees for the feat .
using a funnel , they placed the insects onto his abdomen , where they climbed up to rest on his chin .
they were attracted to his body by the scent or pheromones given off by the queen bee which mr mccabe had placed on his chin .
speaking after the attempt , mr mccabe urged people to sponsor a bee with all profits from the record attempt going to two charities - apimondia ireland 2005 and bothar and bees for development trust , which support beekeeping projects in developing countries .

this is partly down to technology that can not talk to each other .
it has also traditionally been a dream that only the uber-rich can make reality .
but with rising broadband speeds and connections , the rise of wireless networks , and cheaper more powerful machines in homes , it is getting easier to realise the smart home dream .
a lot more now can be controlled from one central machine , with one central and easy interface , which is what convergence is supposed to be about .
hooking devices together , either wirelessly or with cables , is another matter .
' digital plumber ' technical know-how is just one of the stumbling blocks many face when trying to work out why one gadget will not talk to another .
homes that are smart are not just about being able to send pictures and video to different rooms either .
it is also about the more mundane technologies in life , such as heating and lighting , and security technologies .
quick guide broadband central locking for homes , for example , could be all controlled through fobs in the near future , for instance , or even through biometrics .
will levy , founder of touch of a button , imagines one day soon being able to pick up the phone directory and easily find the equivalent of a registered " digital plumber " .
for a reasonable fee , they could come and install your fresh bit of kit , advise on security , and be on hand at the end of an e-mail or phone for aftercare services .
mr levy 's vision of " digital plumbing " is squarely aimed at ordinary people who want their homes smart and more connected .
" there is a huge amount of integration needed between different products , " he told the bbc news website .
" there are hundreds of companies which are home automation installers .
" the problem for me is that the starting price for that is a minimum of £ 27,000 . "
that is not the way to push convergence and smart home technologies out to the mass market , he says .
" these are not distant future technologies , they are all out on the shelf today , and they are just a few hundred pounds . "
he thinks there needs to be more qualified people who can take the ordinary non-technical person step-by-step through the set-up and the integration of technologies with other systems around the home .
" it could be very much like getting the plumber around , " says mr levy .
" i could see in five or 10 years ' time having them in the yellow pages alongside plumber or electricians that you call out . "
cost of living digitally according to research by us digital home consultants , the diffusion group -lrb- tdg -rrb- , more than half of us households are interested in some sort of home control system , if the price tag is less than $ 200 .
tdg also found that global home networking is set to grow from 35 million households in 2004 to more than 162 million by 2010 .
there is more demand for people who can hook up home networks with that , says tdg , the number of devices and gadgets that will be able to use that network will rise from 108 million in 2004 to just shy of one billion by 2010 .
instead of three devices able to talk on the network to others in every household in 2004 on average , there will be six .
others predict that 23 million european households will be using wireless home networks to share media content by 2009 .
despite these healthy-looking predictions , intel research on the 21st century living room revealed that 42 % of brits complained that technology was already crowding them out of their own houses .
one in four living rooms are stacking up more than seven separate technology devices .
the average brit does not have an american style open-plan living space either .
rooms are smaller and ceilings are lower .

more than 500 non-americans - many captured during the war in afghanistan and declared " enemy combatants " - are being detained at the facility .

their visit came at a time of growing concern that treatment of prisoners there is harming america 's image .
more than 500 non-americans - many captured during the war in afghanistan and declared " enemy combatants " - are being detained at the facility .
only four current inmates have been charged with any crime .
on saturday 16 representatives who sit on the house armed services committee toured the prison , at a naval base on cuba , during a one-day fact-finding trip .
legal framework california democrat ellen tauscher , who has pushed for greater transparency about the facility , told ap news agency there had been progress since reports about alleged human rights abuses .
in pictures : us prison camp " the guantanamo we saw today is not the guantanamo we heard about a few years ago , " she said .
" what we 've seen here is evidence that we 've made progress , " said sheila jackson lee , a texas democrat who believes the facility should close .
but legislators agreed that more needed to be done to ensure a legal framework to deal with detainees , some of whom have been held for three years without charge .
the group toured cell blocks and ate lunch with troops , a meal of chicken with orange sauce , rice and okra that was also served to inmates .
they watched the interrogation of three suspects , including one in which a detainee was read a harry potter book aloud for hours until he turned his back and put his hands over his ears .
none of the detainees was physically touched .
' degrading treatment ' united nations human rights investigators last week urged the us to allow them to inspect the facility .
they said there were " persistent and credible " reports of " serious allegations of torture , cruel , inhuman and degrading treatment of detainees " .
in response , vice-president dick cheney told cnn that the detainees were well treated , well fed and " living in the tropics " .
white house officials say there are no plans to close the facility because , they say , the detainees are too dangerous to release while the fight against terrorism continues .

tim wright , from gelli , rhondda , south wales , is marking seven years since he swapped life in the uk to teach drums in the middle east .
he drives to work every day past palm tree-lined roads , through what used to be a desert , to a purpose-built complex housing the royal oman symphony orchestra -lrb- roso -rrb- .
mr wright , 32 , is a percussion tutor at roso , which was set up two decades ago because of the sultan of oman 's love of classical music .
his job which carries the title of civilian officer in the sultan 's royal guard sees him teaching students and organising his section for concerts .
the orchestra was set up in 1985 " the orchestra was conceived in 1985 , when sultan qaboos bin said decided he wanted an orchestra of omani nationals , " he said .
" young omanis from all over the country applied , sat musical aptitude tests and the successful applicants gained places in the initial orchestra .
" being an arab country , there was no tradition of western classical music , and the students had to start from the very beginning - they were initially schooled in english , maths , science and music theory .
" professional players / tutors were recruited as trainers for each section of the orchestra - my job is to teach the percussion section , the tutor for trumpet is andrew cuff who is from pontypridd . "
sultan qaboos bin said takes a very personal interest in the running of the orchestra .
" the first orchestras in europe began from royal or wealthy families who paid for them - here it is a similar situation , " said mr wright .
" we perform both private and public concerts in oman and abroad . "
mr wright said education was a very big part of his day-to-day work in the orchestra .
the wrights have been in oman for seven years " it is a varied job , you can teach , perform , and take players through individual development like a music college , " he said .
" alongside the orchestra , there is a school - an ongoing recruitment process sees young omanis being trained to eventually perform in the orchestra . "
his wife rachel , 30 , is director of music at the british school in oman .
the couple , who have a two-year-old son jacob osian , decided to move after becoming fed up with barely seeing each other as they lived and worked in london .
they saw their chance to escape in a newspaper advert .
" i had been freelancing in london as a player , working for varied organisations such as the royal national theatre and the english national ballet , and basically saw the job advertised and applied , " he said .
" we had n't been to the middle east before - it was something that interested us .
" oman is a wonderful place to live and work - the omanis are a very friendly people and it is a beautiful country .
" we thought we would do it for a couple of years , but we are still here seven years later . "
