" i am referring to the g4 resorting to financial leverage and to financial pressures in order to induce a government to align , or not to align , itself with a certain position , or to co-sponsor or vote in favor of a certain draft , " spatafora said . in dramatic fashion , he threw his support behind a rival draft introduced in the general assembly by canada on behalf of the so-called united for consensus -lrb- ufc -rrb- group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council that draft would enlarge the council to 25 seats , with 10 new non-permanent members that would be elected for two-year terms , with the possibility of immediate re-election . charging that an unnamed g4 donor country had terminated a development project valued at $ 460,000 -lrb- 370,000 euros -rrb- for a recipient country which sided with the ufc rather than with the g4 , the italian envoy said : " it is a shame ... enough is enough . " " reforms can not be dictated by power or money , " he noted .
" we have a moral obligation not to allow a reform of the security council to be decided in this unhealthy and poisoned environment . " g4 blueprint vs united for consensus resolution the contentious wrangling over security council reform has been debated for a decade and has been given momentum this year by un secretary-general kofi annan , who argues that the council is unrepresentative and reflects the balance of power at the end of world war two .
italy has long campaigned against adding new permanent members to the council .
a seat for germany would leave rome as the only big western european nation without one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 the g4 blueprint , which is backed by more than 30 countries including france and britain , calls for boosting council membership from 15 members to 25 , including six new permanent seats without veto power - one each for brazil , germany , india and japan and two for the african region . " the g4 model is structured in such a way as to benefit just six happy few , at the detriment of all the other 180 member states , and with a tremendous divisive impact on the membership , " the italian envoy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-thirds majority is needed in the 191-member general assembly for adoption .
introducing the united for consensus resolution , canada 's un ambassador allan rock called it " the fairest and most democratic approach to the complex and controversial question of security council enlargement , while seeking the broadest possible consensus on how to proceed . " he said the draft would distribute the elected 20 non-permanent seats equitably among the geographic regions and would leave each region the decision about arrangements for both the rotation of the seats and the duration of each member state 's period on the council . the document is co-sponsored by argentina , canada , colombia , costa rica , italy , malta , mexico , pakistan , south korea , san marino , spain and turkey and is a clear attempt to drain support away from the g4 text , which is facing strong opposition led by the united states . g4 plan runs into trouble pakistan is adamantly opposed to india securing permanent membership of the council , brazil 's bid is opposed by argentina and several latin american countries , japan 's by china and south korea while italy leads opposition to germany 's bid , diplomats said . at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful security council , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile g4 foreign ministers met with an africa union -lrb- au -rrb- delegation led by nigerian foreign minister olu adeniji in london monday to try to overcome differences between their rival drafts on security council enlargement . differences centered on the au 's demand for veto power for the two permanent security council seats that would be allocated to africa and for five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa . on the issue of the additional non-permanent seat sought by the africans , it was suggested that the council should be expanded to 26 members , with the 26th seat circulating among developing countries of africa , asia and latin america and the caribbean states.the g4 and the au ministers decided to refer the issue to their respective heads of state . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last chance talks for g4 un hopefuls diplomats from germany , india , japan , brazil and the african union meet in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expanding the un security council by september .

according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race . " he 's already very involved , " said team manager johan bruyneel .
" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .
the discovery channel team has a wealth of potential yellow jersey riders waiting to step up . young pretenders ready for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo savoldelli paolo savoldelli -lrb- photo -rrb- won the tour of italy in june while yaroslav popvych is a potential yellow jersey contender who won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider aged 25 or under . " he did well for his debut on the tour , " said bruyneel of the ukrainian who won the world under-23 road race crown in 2001 .
" in general you have to be careful with young riders but he has been promising .
he managed to stay with lance in some of the final sections of the big climbs which is not easy . " for the first time in seven years , the discovery channel team will go into the tour de france as underdogs but the jury is still out on whether jan ullrich will be the favorite for the race in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt . " we also wo n't send any german soldiers to iraq , " gerhardt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election issues : what 's at stake dw-world takes you through the hot-button issues , explaining what 's really at stake in this election and how the parties line-up across the spectrum .

dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations . the furnaces may have been extinguished and most of the coal mines shut down , but the ruhr basin in western germany is still undeniably a working class region .
although workers gritty and smudged with coal dust are few and far between , the area ’ s industrial past continues to shape its people and landscape to this day . in the postwar years , coal mining and steel manufacture were integral to germany 's economic recovery .
in the densely populated ruhr basin , the heavy industry meant an almost certain guarantee for employment and economic prosperity .
from all around germany and europe , workers came to the coal mines and steel mills of the " ruhrpott " in hopes of making a living .
and for decades the region flourished .
but then the economy re-oriented itself , coal became less important for the country 's progress ; and a steady decline set in as companies folded , mines closed and the industry fell into a recession .
hundreds of thousands of workers were laid off . for the last two decades , the region has worked to change itself structurally , to wean itself of its dependence on coal and attract new industries .
however , the efforts have been without major success .
in gelsenkirchen , in the heart of the ruhr basin , one in every four people is unemployed today .
pockmarked by abandoned mines and industrial ruins , the conglomeration of cities is one of the poorest in western germany . bildunterschrift : steel workers protest closures in bochum just as coal and steel were integrally connected to everyday life in the past , it was practically a law of nature that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- called the shots in the ruhr basin .
for decades , the majority of the 5.5 million inhabitants between bottrop and duisburg , oberhausen and dortmund voted red .
even in the last state elections in may , when the social democrats saw their worst postwar result in north rhine-westphalia since 1954 , the spd remained the strongest party in the region . but the people on the party basis see trouble brewing ahead , and they are tired , worn-out from campaigning .
even longtime spd members are asking themselves if it 's even worth it to vote for their party - let alone rub their hands sore for the spd in the september elections . and if the core of the party is skeptical , what does that say about the spd 's chances as a whole ?
what do the grass-root members think about chancellor gerhard schröder and his policies ?
what are the expectations of the one-time heart of the party in this campaign ?
dw-world visited three spd members in the ruhr basin . christiane wolters -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the unionist it 's been a long time , but the memory is still alive .
as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore .
the young spd member sebastian kolkau heads up the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt .
the local chapter chairman the spd is battling a membership decline .
but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .
here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why .
the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt . " we also wo n't send any german soldiers to iraq , " gerhardt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election issues : what 's at stake dw-world takes you through the hot-button issues , explaining what 's really at stake in this election and how the parties line-up across the spectrum .

consumers remain stubbornly reluctant to spend .
but the luxury sector is all smiles these days .
gucci and co. are booming . for large retailers who serve the mid-range market , the news just keeps getting worse .
germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .

relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance . " the mid-range is suffering , but luxury brands are in demand and people are spending a lot of money on them , " said ulrich binnebössel , spokesman for the hde retail association . luxury in style while the karstadts of the retail sector are closing underperforming stores , berlin 's galeries lafayette , the high-end french department store on one of the capital 's luxury shopping streets , friedrichstrasse , is adding another floor and plans on featuring more designer labels , which will cost a pretty penny .

the store has rebuilt its " luxury boulevard " on the ground floor , giving a more prominent place to designer names such as louis vuitton and gucci . " in general we have the feeling that high-end brands perform better than the broad mid-range , " said petra fladenhofer , spokeswoman for kadewe .

as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore . dietmar bartsch is n't used to asking himself such questions .
for a long time , there was no room for doubt : he was a member of the social democrats and he voted the party line . the 42-year-old miner has been an active unionist and a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for 18 years .
one thing led to another - " the usual stuff , " said bartsch referring to how he first got involved in the party . what used to be " usual " in the ruhr basin has increasingly turned into the exception .
in the 1950s , some 500,000 people worked in coal mining ; and party activism was simply part of the working class culture .
today , that number has shrunk to 40,000 .
and even fewer people are interested in getting politically involved . voter turnout in the region leaves much to be desired - and the spd feels the decline most of all .
in the past , everything ran like a well-oiled machine .
today , the party has trouble mobilizing its once regular voters : the miners and factory workers . no more hands-on work bartsch has witnessed first-hand the changes .
sitting in his office at the auguste-victoria mine in marl since five o 'clock in the morning , he reflects on the party 's past and its chances for the future . the previous evening had been a late one .
bartsch was at an spd meeting in his hometown of recklinghausen .
and , as is the case whenever " comrades " meet these days , all talk was focused on the upcoming early elections in september .
bartsch says he feels " a mixture of resignation and hope " in view of yet another election campaign , just two months after losing the state elections in north rhine-westphalia . " no one seriously expects a victory , " he sighs .
" but what else can we do ? "
he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?
" has any of them ever really gotten their hands dirty ? " nonetheless , the unionist and long-time spd member concedes that reforms are necessary and will continue to be important for the future . lots of " basta , " little substance but bartsch criticizes party heads for the approach they take to problem-solving .
all too often they resort to a knee-jerk , " basta " -lrb- the italian word for " that 's enough " -rrb- policy when caught in a tight spot .
reforms should n't be a form of " basta " politics from above , bartsch says .
the party leaders need to take people 's fears seriously and spend time explaining policies to them . the spd is lacking the right people for this right now , bartsch laments .
gone are the days of the great party figureheads like willy brandt , herbert wehner or helmut schmidt , " who had a social democrat heart and proudly wore it on their sleeve . " still , bartsch he will campaign for the spd , which is still his party .
" if you do n't fight , you ’ ve already lost , " he says .
but his words fall flat , lacking a fiery spirit . christiane wolters -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the young spd member sebastian kolkau heads up the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt .
fighting for the heart of the spd the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations .
the local chapter chairman the spd is battling a membership decline .
but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .

as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore . dietmar bartsch is n't used to asking himself such questions .
for a long time , there was no room for doubt : he was a member of the social democrats and he voted the party line . the 42-year-old miner has been an active unionist and a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for 18 years .
one thing led to another - " the usual stuff , " said bartsch referring to how he first got involved in the party . what used to be " usual " in the ruhr basin has increasingly turned into the exception .
in the 1950s , some 500,000 people worked in coal mining ; and party activism was simply part of the working class culture .
today , that number has shrunk to 40,000 .
and even fewer people are interested in getting politically involved . voter turnout in the region leaves much to be desired - and the spd feels the decline most of all .
in the past , everything ran like a well-oiled machine .
today , the party has trouble mobilizing its once regular voters : the miners and factory workers . no more hands-on work bartsch has witnessed first-hand the changes .
sitting in his office at the auguste-victoria mine in marl since five o 'clock in the morning , he reflects on the party 's past and its chances for the future . the previous evening had been a late one .
bartsch was at an spd meeting in his hometown of recklinghausen .
and , as is the case whenever " comrades " meet these days , all talk was focused on the upcoming early elections in september .
bartsch says he feels " a mixture of resignation and hope " in view of yet another election campaign , just two months after losing the state elections in north rhine-westphalia . " no one seriously expects a victory , " he sighs .
" but what else can we do ? "
he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?
" has any of them ever really gotten their hands dirty ? " nonetheless , the unionist and long-time spd member concedes that reforms are necessary and will continue to be important for the future . lots of " basta , " little substance but bartsch criticizes party heads for the approach they take to problem-solving .
all too often they resort to a knee-jerk , " basta " -lrb- the italian word for " that 's enough " -rrb- policy when caught in a tight spot .
reforms should n't be a form of " basta " politics from above , bartsch says .
the party leaders need to take people 's fears seriously and spend time explaining policies to them . the spd is lacking the right people for this right now , bartsch laments .
gone are the days of the great party figureheads like willy brandt , herbert wehner or helmut schmidt , " who had a social democrat heart and proudly wore it on their sleeve . " still , bartsch he will campaign for the spd , which is still his party .
" if you do n't fight , you ’ ve already lost , " he says .

but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .
here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why . the " squirrel campaign " was a success and dieter knappmann is visibly proud of the fact .
what sounds so conspiratorial actually worked according to a very simple principle .
every spd member in the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck was urged to recruit new members for the party in their own circles . " you really approached everyone you knew and tried to convince them , " says chapter chairman knappmann .
the plan worked .
following a wave of party departures three years ago , the local chapter in this working class neighborhood is proud to have swelled to 220 members in the meantime .
there 's also been a change in generations as more young people get involved in the party , knappmann explains . the spd in brauck is doing better than elsewhere , where many chapters have had to merge due to dwindling membership .
it 's all a question of roots and " whether you really want to be the advocate of the people , " says the 60-year-old , who 's been on the chapter 's board for 33 years . running out of breath knappmann looks forward to the election campaign quite calmly .
" our philosophy is that it 's actually always an election campaign , " says knappmann .
" a lot of our activities were already planned before we knew there would be early elections .
now , they 're taking place right during the campaign . " in brauck , everything is ready " from the stands to the assignment of the polling stations . "
but here , like other parts of the ruhr basin , the core base is tired .
following a rapid string of european , municipal and state elections , the chapter sees itself campaigning for the fourth time in just over a year .
" we are running out of breath , " knappmann adds . where 's the fire ? still , knappmann thinks early elections are a good thing .
for him , the ideal result would be a grand coalition between the spd and the conservative opposition christian democrats .
" that would be the only way to solve the societal problems , " he says . knappmann says he does n't understand other spd members who turn away from the party because they claim they can no longer identify themselves with it .
" we 're not happy with everything , but you 're either committed to the basic values of social democracy or you were just a follower anyway , " says knappmann . recalling an apt quote to describe the situation , the party chairman says , " tradition is preserving the fire and not revering the ashes . "
at the moment , though , " there 's no one to ignite that fire .

he has to hear " damn spd " or " you cutthroats " even though he ca n't do anything about the decisions made in berlin .

he says he could envision such a position , even if he wouldn ’ t go so far as to call it his dream .
first , he wants to finish his business degree and go from there .
he certainly has enough to do on the side : for the jusos and as a research associate in the office of a member of parliament in gelsenkirchen . as for working for a party that currently holds the " loser image " ?

consumers remain stubbornly reluctant to spend .
but the luxury sector is all smiles these days .
gucci and co. are booming . for large retailers who serve the mid-range market , the news just keeps getting worse .
germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt department store one of the country 's biggest department store chains , karstadtquelle , lost more than 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- last year and its emergency cost-cutting plan cost 5,500 jobs . german brand names that have been fixtures of middle-class life , such as appliance makers aeg and miele , are cutting thousands of jobs .
relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance . " the mid-range is suffering , but luxury brands are in demand and people are spending a lot of money on them , " said ulrich binnebössel , spokesman for the hde retail association . luxury in style while the karstadts of the retail sector are closing underperforming stores , berlin 's galeries lafayette , the high-end french department store on one of the capital 's luxury shopping streets , friedrichstrasse , is adding another floor and plans on featuring more designer labels , which will cost a pretty penny . " we 're reacting to a brisk demand , " thierry prevost , the store 's director , said in an interview , adding that store sales had increased by 25 percent in both 2004 and 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model takes the catwalk on a recreated trevi 's fountain during the dolce & gabbana fall / winter 2004/2005 fashion collection , presented in milan , italy .

the store has rebuilt its " luxury boulevard " on the ground floor , giving a more prominent place to designer names such as louis vuitton and gucci . " in general we have the feeling that high-end brands perform better than the broad mid-range , " said petra fladenhofer , spokeswoman for kadewe .
" the luxury boulevard has developed very successfully . " tourists eager to buy but it 's not as if berliners have suddenly developed a taste for the finer things in life .
the german capital is traditionally a fairly working-class kind of town .

but berlin 's tourist industry is booming and visitors are the ones who make up a good portion of the luxury shoppers .
at galeries lafayette , 40 percent of the customer base is made up of tourists . the same applies to quartier 206 .
the other 60 percent of their clientele , germans , generally have made a special trip to berlin to go shopping .
at kadewe 's luxury mile , a full half of those snapping up the one-of-a-kind , extremely pricey products were foreign tourists . most companies agree that the russians are the nationality most represented among these image-conscious visitors .
in fact , according to the berlin 's tourism office , the number of russian tourists increased by 22 percent in the first four months of 2005 .
many of them have money to burn and taste for the flashy . " most tourists come from eastern europe , russia and poland , and when they spend money , wow ! " said angela contzen , a spokeswoman for departmentstore in quartier 206 .

it 's a simple , and very german , desire to save on certain things , like food , no matter how much money is in the bank account . " it 's often the case that one drives with one 's mercedes to the discount store to shop for cheap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same phenomenon is helping the high-end as well , as the trend to mix and match luxury and discount items catches on , the " crossover look .

every spd member in the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck was urged to recruit new members for the party in their own circles . " you really approached everyone you knew and tried to convince them , " says chapter chairman knappmann .
the plan worked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2005 luxury brightens dark retail landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury is hot , mid-market is so last year mid-range german retailers have been singing the blues for years .
consumers remain stubbornly reluctant to spend .
but the luxury sector is all smiles these days .
gucci and co. are booming . for large retailers who serve the mid-range market , the news just keeps getting worse .
germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt department store one of the country 's biggest department store chains , karstadtquelle , lost more than 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- last year and its emergency cost-cutting plan cost 5,500 jobs . german brand names that have been fixtures of middle-class life , such as appliance makers aeg and miele , are cutting thousands of jobs .
relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance . " the mid-range is suffering , but luxury brands are in demand and people are spending a lot of money on them , " said ulrich binnebössel , spokesman for the hde retail association . luxury in style while the karstadts of the retail sector are closing underperforming stores , berlin 's galeries lafayette , the high-end french department store on one of the capital 's luxury shopping streets , friedrichstrasse , is adding another floor and plans on featuring more designer labels , which will cost a pretty penny . " we 're reacting to a brisk demand , " thierry prevost , the store 's director , said in an interview , adding that store sales had increased by 25 percent in both 2004 and 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model takes the catwalk on a recreated trevi 's fountain during the dolce & gabbana fall / winter 2004/2005 fashion collection , presented in milan , italy .
other high-end retailers report similar developments .
the exclusive quartier 206 , just down the street from galeries lafayette and housing names such as comme des garcons , dolce & gabbana -lrb- photo -rrb- and prada , reports double-digit growth . kadewe , the western berlin shopping mecca and tourist magnet , is putting the emphasis on luxury , seeing it as a way out of the general retail malaise .
the store has rebuilt its " luxury boulevard " on the ground floor , giving a more prominent place to designer names such as louis vuitton and gucci . " in general we have the feeling that high-end brands perform better than the broad mid-range , " said petra fladenhofer , spokeswoman for kadewe .
" the luxury boulevard has developed very successfully . " tourists eager to buy but it 's not as if berliners have suddenly developed a taste for the finer things in life .
the german capital is traditionally a fairly working-class kind of town .
with its high unemployment rate and serious economic enervation , the latest hermès scarf or helmut lang shoes are not exactly near the top of most residents ' shopping lists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists stroll near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but berlin 's tourist industry is booming and visitors are the ones who make up a good portion of the luxury shoppers .
at galeries lafayette , 40 percent of the customer base is made up of tourists . the same applies to quartier 206 .
the other 60 percent of their clientele , germans , generally have made a special trip to berlin to go shopping .
at kadewe 's luxury mile , a full half of those snapping up the one-of-a-kind , extremely pricey products were foreign tourists . most companies agree that the russians are the nationality most represented among these image-conscious visitors .
in fact , according to the berlin 's tourism office , the number of russian tourists increased by 22 percent in the first four months of 2005 .
many of them have money to burn and taste for the flashy . " most tourists come from eastern europe , russia and poland , and when they spend money , wow ! " said angela contzen , a spokeswoman for departmentstore in quartier 206 .
close on their heels are the americans , she added . strong at both ends , weak in the middle binnebössel from hde retail association says while the high-end is performing well , another sector is also booming : the discounters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not luxury brands , but wildly popular grocery stores like aldi and lidl , with low overhead , limited selections and cut-rate prices , are enjoying a brisk business . while he admits that germany 's poor economic climate has kept people from going on shopping sprees , according to him , it 's not only a lack of money that is drawing people to the low-end .
it 's a simple , and very german , desire to save on certain things , like food , no matter how much money is in the bank account . " it 's often the case that one drives with one 's mercedes to the discount store to shop for cheap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same phenomenon is helping the high-end as well , as the trend to mix and match luxury and discount items catches on , the " crossover look . "
shoppers save money on no-name jeans and a simple top , but then splurge for designer shoes or a bag . " and it has to be the ‘ it ' bag , very expensive , " said departmentstore 's contzen .

he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 the unionist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar bartsch : " mixture of hope and resignation " it 's been a long time , but the memory is still alive .
as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore . dietmar bartsch is n't used to asking himself such questions .
for a long time , there was no room for doubt : he was a member of the social democrats and he voted the party line . the 42-year-old miner has been an active unionist and a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for 18 years .
one thing led to another - " the usual stuff , " said bartsch referring to how he first got involved in the party . what used to be " usual " in the ruhr basin has increasingly turned into the exception .
in the 1950s , some 500,000 people worked in coal mining ; and party activism was simply part of the working class culture .
today , that number has shrunk to 40,000 .
and even fewer people are interested in getting politically involved . voter turnout in the region leaves much to be desired - and the spd feels the decline most of all .
in the past , everything ran like a well-oiled machine .
today , the party has trouble mobilizing its once regular voters : the miners and factory workers . no more hands-on work bartsch has witnessed first-hand the changes .
sitting in his office at the auguste-victoria mine in marl since five o 'clock in the morning , he reflects on the party 's past and its chances for the future . the previous evening had been a late one .
bartsch was at an spd meeting in his hometown of recklinghausen .
and , as is the case whenever " comrades " meet these days , all talk was focused on the upcoming early elections in september .
bartsch says he feels " a mixture of resignation and hope " in view of yet another election campaign , just two months after losing the state elections in north rhine-westphalia . " no one seriously expects a victory , " he sighs .
" but what else can we do ? "
he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?
" has any of them ever really gotten their hands dirty ? " nonetheless , the unionist and long-time spd member concedes that reforms are necessary and will continue to be important for the future . lots of " basta , " little substance but bartsch criticizes party heads for the approach they take to problem-solving .
all too often they resort to a knee-jerk , " basta " -lrb- the italian word for " that 's enough " -rrb- policy when caught in a tight spot .
reforms should n't be a form of " basta " politics from above , bartsch says .
the party leaders need to take people 's fears seriously and spend time explaining policies to them . the spd is lacking the right people for this right now , bartsch laments .
gone are the days of the great party figureheads like willy brandt , herbert wehner or helmut schmidt , " who had a social democrat heart and proudly wore it on their sleeve . " still , bartsch he will campaign for the spd , which is still his party .
" if you do n't fight , you ’ ve already lost , " he says .
but his words fall flat , lacking a fiery spirit . christiane wolters -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the young spd member sebastian kolkau heads up the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt .
fighting for the heart of the spd the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations .
the local chapter chairman the spd is battling a membership decline .
but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .
here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why .

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race . " he 's already very involved , " said team manager johan bruyneel .
" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .
the discovery channel team has a wealth of potential yellow jersey riders waiting to step up . young pretenders ready for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo savoldelli paolo savoldelli -lrb- photo -rrb- won the tour of italy in june while yaroslav popvych is a potential yellow jersey contender who won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider aged 25 or under . " he did well for his debut on the tour , " said bruyneel of the ukrainian who won the world under-23 road race crown in 2001 .
" in general you have to be careful with young riders but he has been promising .
he managed to stay with lance in some of the final sections of the big climbs which is not easy . " for the first time in seven years , the discovery channel team will go into the tour de france as underdogs but the jury is still out on whether jan ullrich will be the favorite for the race in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt . " we also wo n't send any german soldiers to iraq , " gerhardt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election issues : what 's at stake dw-world takes you through the hot-button issues , explaining what 's really at stake in this election and how the parties line-up across the spectrum .

the financial bad news comes on the heels of a corruption scandal . in a telephone news conference on tuesday , infineon head wolfgang ziebart said the " unsatisfactory results " were due to memory chip prices that have fallen 30 percent .
mobile phone manufacturers are also buying fewer components from the munich-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ziebart , ceo of infineon technologies " i do n't think it will be possible to attain a positive operating result this year , " ziebart said .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .
the official occasion is the peace prize koch will present tibet 's spiritual and political leader on wednesday as an accolade for his peaceful campaign to maintain his country 's autonomy from china .
" i think the tibetan people need friends , because the peaceful way to change a world that is marked by political interests and power games is especially difficult , " he said .
" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race . " he 's already very involved , " said team manager johan bruyneel .
" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .
the discovery channel team has a wealth of potential yellow jersey riders waiting to step up . young pretenders ready for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo savoldelli paolo savoldelli -lrb- photo -rrb- won the tour of italy in june while yaroslav popvych is a potential yellow jersey contender who won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider aged 25 or under . " he did well for his debut on the tour , " said bruyneel of the ukrainian who won the world under-23 road race crown in 2001 .
" in general you have to be careful with young riders but he has been promising .
he managed to stay with lance in some of the final sections of the big climbs which is not easy .

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race .

he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt . sebastian kolkau only knows willy brandt from anecdotes , and he doesn ’ t see the one-time idol of social democrats as a role model for the young generation today .
" at least i 've never heard anyone at the jusos say ' i want to be like willy brandt ' , " says kolkau , who ponders whether everything really was better in the spd back in those days .
who can say ? " we only hear the stories , but no one knows what it was really like , " he surmises . it 's the ideas that count the 26-year-old head of the jusos in gelsenkirchen does n't believe that it 's up to individuals to make the spd strong again .
the contents are more important , he says .
" people need to regain confidence in the spd and in order to do that , you need ideas , " argues kolkau .
" if schröder would recite the election manifesto , it would not be authentic because in the past years , he just did too little of what is in it . " according to kolkau , a change in party personnel might be the right thing for a new beginning . anger and ambivalence after five years , kolkau still enjoys working for the party .
but it has its ups and downs , he admits .
the downside includes standing on the street campaigning for the spd or jusos while people walk by yelling out their anger at him .
he has to hear " damn spd " or " you cutthroats " even though he ca n't do anything about the decisions made in berlin . " it ’ s really ambivalent for me because you stand there and think , actually they ’ re right , " says kolkau . maybe kolkau will one day find himself in a position where he 's responsible for political policies , as a representative in the state or federal parliament .
he says he could envision such a position , even if he wouldn ’ t go so far as to call it his dream .
first , he wants to finish his business degree and go from there .
he certainly has enough to do on the side : for the jusos and as a research associate in the office of a member of parliament in gelsenkirchen . as for working for a party that currently holds the " loser image " ?
" it ’ s not that bad in gelsenkirchen , " he says .

" police investigators had argued that the law , which allows tapping of phones even when there is no suspicion of criminal activity , is an important tool in the anti-terror fight .
the decision is a victory for civil rights activists , who are worried that recent terrorist attacks in london and sharm al-sheik could lead to increased security measures at the expense of personal freedom . success breeds imitation such measures could come sooner rather than later in cities across europe .
based on the success video survillance equipment has had in helping london police track down terrorism suspects linked to the recent bombings , several european governments are mulling more aggressive public surveillance measures . in france , interior minister nicolas sarkozy announced on monday that cameras would be installed by the end of the year in more than 4,000 buses . sarkozy also said an anti-terrorist law , containing plans for video surveillance and collection of telephone data , would be introduced to parliament after the summer recess and is expected to be adopted before christmas . in germany , the city of berlin and the regional government of brandenburg have announced plans to add cameras to the existing network covering public transport and to maintain an older archive of video footage . " after the attacks on the british capital , we do n't want to be criticized for not adequately responding , " said berlin public transports company -lrb- bvg -rrb- chief thomas necker . rome , moscow promise more and better cameras in italy , which has been regularly threatened in internet messages by groups claiming links to the radical islamist organisation al-qaeda , a million surveillance cameras are already in place and the government has decided to install more and of better quality , particularly in the rome metro . bildunterschrift : these cctv images of the london bombers have led to arrests .

a number of governments , including france , have asked mobile telephone network operators to archive all these elements for a year , while stopping short of taping conversations . more police control over mobile phones similar measures are also being considered by spain , where police would also like to remove the anonymity of the 24 million spaniards and residents , who use pre-paid mobile telephone cards . this type of card was used by the bombers of the madrid suburban rail network in 2004 . mobile telephones were used to set off the bombs used in those attacks in which 191 people died .
last week , the italian government brought in a new regulation which requires people buying computer chips for mobile telephones to provide proof of identity . greek minister for public order george voulgarakis has asked mobile network operators to establish procedures to provide police with rapid access to mobile telephone call information and called for european legislation which harmonises this type of system across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy , germany and other countries have introduced biometric passports the introduction of biometric passports , which use physical identification markers such as fingerprints or eye scans , will also be accelerated following the london bombings .
the european union has already said these types of passports will be obligatory within three years .
scandinavian countries staying the same in most countries the opposition to these types of security measures is facing an uphill battle following the two sets of bomb attacks in london and the latest attack on the red sea resort of sharm el-sheik in egypt , which killed 88 people last saturday . in italy , an opinion poll published ten days after the london bombings found that 74 percent of those surveyed were in favor of more security cameras in public places and 60 percent support tighter surveillance of electronic messages . however there remains opposition to this increased government intrusion into people 's private lives .
in denmark , a country often threatened in al-qaeda statements on the internet , a bill to increase police powers of surveillance was rejected by parliament . " the citizens must be able to move around in peace , " said ruling liberal party spokeswoman birthe roenn hornbech . in sweden , which has far less video surveillance of public places than britain , a recent study concluded that the current system works well and does not need to be expanded , according to justice ministry advisor maria kelt .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 fighting for the heart of the spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pit frame in the ruhr basin : a relic from the past the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations . the furnaces may have been extinguished and most of the coal mines shut down , but the ruhr basin in western germany is still undeniably a working class region .
although workers gritty and smudged with coal dust are few and far between , the area ’ s industrial past continues to shape its people and landscape to this day . in the postwar years , coal mining and steel manufacture were integral to germany 's economic recovery .
in the densely populated ruhr basin , the heavy industry meant an almost certain guarantee for employment and economic prosperity .
from all around germany and europe , workers came to the coal mines and steel mills of the " ruhrpott " in hopes of making a living .
and for decades the region flourished .
but then the economy re-oriented itself , coal became less important for the country 's progress ; and a steady decline set in as companies folded , mines closed and the industry fell into a recession .
hundreds of thousands of workers were laid off . for the last two decades , the region has worked to change itself structurally , to wean itself of its dependence on coal and attract new industries .
however , the efforts have been without major success .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 fighting for the heart of the spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pit frame in the ruhr basin : a relic from the past the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations . the furnaces may have been extinguished and most of the coal mines shut down , but the ruhr basin in western germany is still undeniably a working class region .
although workers gritty and smudged with coal dust are few and far between , the area ’ s industrial past continues to shape its people and landscape to this day . in the postwar years , coal mining and steel manufacture were integral to germany 's economic recovery .
in the densely populated ruhr basin , the heavy industry meant an almost certain guarantee for employment and economic prosperity .
from all around germany and europe , workers came to the coal mines and steel mills of the " ruhrpott " in hopes of making a living .
and for decades the region flourished .
but then the economy re-oriented itself , coal became less important for the country 's progress ; and a steady decline set in as companies folded , mines closed and the industry fell into a recession .
hundreds of thousands of workers were laid off . for the last two decades , the region has worked to change itself structurally , to wean itself of its dependence on coal and attract new industries .
however , the efforts have been without major success .
in gelsenkirchen , in the heart of the ruhr basin , one in every four people is unemployed today .
pockmarked by abandoned mines and industrial ruins , the conglomeration of cities is one of the poorest in western germany . bildunterschrift : steel workers protest closures in bochum just as coal and steel were integrally connected to everyday life in the past , it was practically a law of nature that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- called the shots in the ruhr basin .

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race . " he 's already very involved , " said team manager johan bruyneel .
" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .
the discovery channel team has a wealth of potential yellow jersey riders waiting to step up . young pretenders ready for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo savoldelli paolo savoldelli -lrb- photo -rrb- won the tour of italy in june while yaroslav popvych is a potential yellow jersey contender who won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider aged 25 or under . " he did well for his debut on the tour , " said bruyneel of the ukrainian who won the world under-23 road race crown in 2001 .
" in general you have to be careful with young riders but he has been promising .
he managed to stay with lance in some of the final sections of the big climbs which is not easy . " for the first time in seven years , the discovery channel team will go into the tour de france as underdogs but the jury is still out on whether jan ullrich will be the favorite for the race in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .

" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .

the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .
angela merkel , a christian democratic union colleague of koch and the party 's chancellor candidate has already hinted relations with beijing wo n't be as cozy should she , as expected , become chancellor this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tibetan monk prays behind the tibetan flag during a ceremony at in dharamsala in march to commemorate the 46th anniversary of national tibetan uprising against china .
" we can see from the u.s. example that one can , on the basis of a close relationship with china , clearly formulate the principles of human rights as well as cultural and religious autonomy , " he said .
" and i believe a national government here in germany should do no more and no less than to promote just that .

" police investigators had argued that the law , which allows tapping of phones even when there is no suspicion of criminal activity , is an important tool in the anti-terror fight .
the decision is a victory for civil rights activists , who are worried that recent terrorist attacks in london and sharm al-sheik could lead to increased security measures at the expense of personal freedom . success breeds imitation such measures could come sooner rather than later in cities across europe .
based on the success video survillance equipment has had in helping london police track down terrorism suspects linked to the recent bombings , several european governments are mulling more aggressive public surveillance measures . in france , interior minister nicolas sarkozy announced on monday that cameras would be installed by the end of the year in more than 4,000 buses . sarkozy also said an anti-terrorist law , containing plans for video surveillance and collection of telephone data , would be introduced to parliament after the summer recess and is expected to be adopted before christmas . in germany , the city of berlin and the regional government of brandenburg have announced plans to add cameras to the existing network covering public transport and to maintain an older archive of video footage . " after the attacks on the british capital , we do n't want to be criticized for not adequately responding , " said berlin public transports company -lrb- bvg -rrb- chief thomas necker . rome , moscow promise more and better cameras in italy , which has been regularly threatened in internet messages by groups claiming links to the radical islamist organisation al-qaeda , a million surveillance cameras are already in place and the government has decided to install more and of better quality , particularly in the rome metro . bildunterschrift : these cctv images of the london bombers have led to arrests .
cities like moscow , rome and berlin and mulling installing more subway video cameras . the london attacks , which killed 52 people and the four suicide bombers on july 7 on the london underground system and a double-decker bus , have also persauded moscow to install a network of video cameras in its metro system : " within a year and a half every carriage of the metro will have one " , said the head of the moscow metro dmitri gaiev . surveillance of mobile telephone networks , which will allow authorities to identify callers , receivers and locations , will also be reinforced .
a number of governments , including france , have asked mobile telephone network operators to archive all these elements for a year , while stopping short of taping conversations . more police control over mobile phones similar measures are also being considered by spain , where police would also like to remove the anonymity of the 24 million spaniards and residents , who use pre-paid mobile telephone cards . this type of card was used by the bombers of the madrid suburban rail network in 2004 . mobile telephones were used to set off the bombs used in those attacks in which 191 people died .
last week , the italian government brought in a new regulation which requires people buying computer chips for mobile telephones to provide proof of identity . greek minister for public order george voulgarakis has asked mobile network operators to establish procedures to provide police with rapid access to mobile telephone call information and called for european legislation which harmonises this type of system across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy , germany and other countries have introduced biometric passports the introduction of biometric passports , which use physical identification markers such as fingerprints or eye scans , will also be accelerated following the london bombings .

as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore . dietmar bartsch is n't used to asking himself such questions .
for a long time , there was no room for doubt : he was a member of the social democrats and he voted the party line . the 42-year-old miner has been an active unionist and a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for 18 years .
one thing led to another - " the usual stuff , " said bartsch referring to how he first got involved in the party . what used to be " usual " in the ruhr basin has increasingly turned into the exception .
in the 1950s , some 500,000 people worked in coal mining ; and party activism was simply part of the working class culture .
today , that number has shrunk to 40,000 .
and even fewer people are interested in getting politically involved . voter turnout in the region leaves much to be desired - and the spd feels the decline most of all .
in the past , everything ran like a well-oiled machine .
today , the party has trouble mobilizing its once regular voters : the miners and factory workers . no more hands-on work bartsch has witnessed first-hand the changes .

bartsch was at an spd meeting in his hometown of recklinghausen .
and , as is the case whenever " comrades " meet these days , all talk was focused on the upcoming early elections in september .
bartsch says he feels " a mixture of resignation and hope " in view of yet another election campaign , just two months after losing the state elections in north rhine-westphalia . " no one seriously expects a victory , " he sighs .
" but what else can we do ? "
he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?
" has any of them ever really gotten their hands dirty ? " nonetheless , the unionist and long-time spd member concedes that reforms are necessary and will continue to be important for the future . lots of " basta , " little substance but bartsch criticizes party heads for the approach they take to problem-solving .
all too often they resort to a knee-jerk , " basta " -lrb- the italian word for " that 's enough " -rrb- policy when caught in a tight spot .
reforms should n't be a form of " basta " politics from above , bartsch says .
the party leaders need to take people 's fears seriously and spend time explaining policies to them . the spd is lacking the right people for this right now , bartsch laments .
gone are the days of the great party figureheads like willy brandt , herbert wehner or helmut schmidt , " who had a social democrat heart and proudly wore it on their sleeve . " still , bartsch he will campaign for the spd , which is still his party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 the new face of germany abroad ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt could well be stepping into joschka fischer 's shoes wolfgang gerhardt , frontrunner for foreign minister under angela merkel , meets jack straw in london wednesday .
he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt . " we also wo n't send any german soldiers to iraq , " gerhardt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election issues : what 's at stake dw-world takes you through the hot-button issues , explaining what 's really at stake in this election and how the parties line-up across the spectrum .

" our philosophy is that it 's actually always an election campaign , " says knappmann .
" a lot of our activities were already planned before we knew there would be early elections .
now , they 're taking place right during the campaign . " in brauck , everything is ready " from the stands to the assignment of the polling stations . "
but here , like other parts of the ruhr basin , the core base is tired .
following a rapid string of european , municipal and state elections , the chapter sees itself campaigning for the fourth time in just over a year .
" we are running out of breath , " knappmann adds . where 's the fire ? still , knappmann thinks early elections are a good thing .
for him , the ideal result would be a grand coalition between the spd and the conservative opposition christian democrats .
" that would be the only way to solve the societal problems , " he says . knappmann says he does n't understand other spd members who turn away from the party because they claim they can no longer identify themselves with it .
" we 're not happy with everything , but you 're either committed to the basic values of social democracy or you were just a follower anyway , " says knappmann . recalling an apt quote to describe the situation , the party chairman says , " tradition is preserving the fire and not revering the ashes . "
at the moment , though , " there 's no one to ignite that fire .

" i am referring to the g4 resorting to financial leverage and to financial pressures in order to induce a government to align , or not to align , itself with a certain position , or to co-sponsor or vote in favor of a certain draft , " spatafora said . in dramatic fashion , he threw his support behind a rival draft introduced in the general assembly by canada on behalf of the so-called united for consensus -lrb- ufc -rrb- group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council that draft would enlarge the council to 25 seats , with 10 new non-permanent members that would be elected for two-year terms , with the possibility of immediate re-election . charging that an unnamed g4 donor country had terminated a development project valued at $ 460,000 -lrb- 370,000 euros -rrb- for a recipient country which sided with the ufc rather than with the g4 , the italian envoy said : " it is a shame ... enough is enough . " " reforms can not be dictated by power or money , " he noted .
" we have a moral obligation not to allow a reform of the security council to be decided in this unhealthy and poisoned environment . " g4 blueprint vs united for consensus resolution the contentious wrangling over security council reform has been debated for a decade and has been given momentum this year by un secretary-general kofi annan , who argues that the council is unrepresentative and reflects the balance of power at the end of world war two .
italy has long campaigned against adding new permanent members to the council .
a seat for germany would leave rome as the only big western european nation without one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 the g4 blueprint , which is backed by more than 30 countries including france and britain , calls for boosting council membership from 15 members to 25 , including six new permanent seats without veto power - one each for brazil , germany , india and japan and two for the african region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.07.2005 can jan ullrich fill the armstrong void ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with armstrong in retirement , can ullrich ride out from the shadows ?
it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race . " he 's already very involved , " said team manager johan bruyneel .
" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .
the discovery channel team has a wealth of potential yellow jersey riders waiting to step up . young pretenders ready for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo savoldelli paolo savoldelli -lrb- photo -rrb- won the tour of italy in june while yaroslav popvych is a potential yellow jersey contender who won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider aged 25 or under . " he did well for his debut on the tour , " said bruyneel of the ukrainian who won the world under-23 road race crown in 2001 .
" in general you have to be careful with young riders but he has been promising .
he managed to stay with lance in some of the final sections of the big climbs which is not easy . " for the first time in seven years , the discovery channel team will go into the tour de france as underdogs but the jury is still out on whether jan ullrich will be the favorite for the race in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .

even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race .

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2005 luxury brightens dark retail landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury is hot , mid-market is so last year mid-range german retailers have been singing the blues for years .
consumers remain stubbornly reluctant to spend .
but the luxury sector is all smiles these days .
gucci and co. are booming . for large retailers who serve the mid-range market , the news just keeps getting worse .
germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt department store one of the country 's biggest department store chains , karstadtquelle , lost more than 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- last year and its emergency cost-cutting plan cost 5,500 jobs . german brand names that have been fixtures of middle-class life , such as appliance makers aeg and miele , are cutting thousands of jobs .
relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance . " the mid-range is suffering , but luxury brands are in demand and people are spending a lot of money on them , " said ulrich binnebössel , spokesman for the hde retail association . luxury in style while the karstadts of the retail sector are closing underperforming stores , berlin 's galeries lafayette , the high-end french department store on one of the capital 's luxury shopping streets , friedrichstrasse , is adding another floor and plans on featuring more designer labels , which will cost a pretty penny . " we 're reacting to a brisk demand , " thierry prevost , the store 's director , said in an interview , adding that store sales had increased by 25 percent in both 2004 and 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model takes the catwalk on a recreated trevi 's fountain during the dolce & gabbana fall / winter 2004/2005 fashion collection , presented in milan , italy .
other high-end retailers report similar developments .
the exclusive quartier 206 , just down the street from galeries lafayette and housing names such as comme des garcons , dolce & gabbana -lrb- photo -rrb- and prada , reports double-digit growth . kadewe , the western berlin shopping mecca and tourist magnet , is putting the emphasis on luxury , seeing it as a way out of the general retail malaise .
the store has rebuilt its " luxury boulevard " on the ground floor , giving a more prominent place to designer names such as louis vuitton and gucci . " in general we have the feeling that high-end brands perform better than the broad mid-range , " said petra fladenhofer , spokeswoman for kadewe .
" the luxury boulevard has developed very successfully . " tourists eager to buy but it 's not as if berliners have suddenly developed a taste for the finer things in life .
the german capital is traditionally a fairly working-class kind of town .
with its high unemployment rate and serious economic enervation , the latest hermès scarf or helmut lang shoes are not exactly near the top of most residents ' shopping lists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists stroll near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but berlin 's tourist industry is booming and visitors are the ones who make up a good portion of the luxury shoppers .
at galeries lafayette , 40 percent of the customer base is made up of tourists . the same applies to quartier 206 .
the other 60 percent of their clientele , germans , generally have made a special trip to berlin to go shopping .
at kadewe 's luxury mile , a full half of those snapping up the one-of-a-kind , extremely pricey products were foreign tourists . most companies agree that the russians are the nationality most represented among these image-conscious visitors .
in fact , according to the berlin 's tourism office , the number of russian tourists increased by 22 percent in the first four months of 2005 .
many of them have money to burn and taste for the flashy . " most tourists come from eastern europe , russia and poland , and when they spend money , wow ! " said angela contzen , a spokeswoman for departmentstore in quartier 206 .
close on their heels are the americans , she added . strong at both ends , weak in the middle binnebössel from hde retail association says while the high-end is performing well , another sector is also booming : the discounters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not luxury brands , but wildly popular grocery stores like aldi and lidl , with low overhead , limited selections and cut-rate prices , are enjoying a brisk business . while he admits that germany 's poor economic climate has kept people from going on shopping sprees , according to him , it 's not only a lack of money that is drawing people to the low-end .
it 's a simple , and very german , desire to save on certain things , like food , no matter how much money is in the bank account . " it 's often the case that one drives with one 's mercedes to the discount store to shop for cheap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same phenomenon is helping the high-end as well , as the trend to mix and match luxury and discount items catches on , the " crossover look . "
shoppers save money on no-name jeans and a simple top , but then splurge for designer shoes or a bag . " and it has to be the ‘ it ' bag , very expensive , " said departmentstore 's contzen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 27.07.2005 can jan ullrich fill the armstrong void ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with armstrong in retirement , can ullrich ride out from the shadows ?
it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race . " he 's already very involved , " said team manager johan bruyneel .
" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .
the discovery channel team has a wealth of potential yellow jersey riders waiting to step up . young pretenders ready for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo savoldelli paolo savoldelli -lrb- photo -rrb- won the tour of italy in june while yaroslav popvych is a potential yellow jersey contender who won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider aged 25 or under . " he did well for his debut on the tour , " said bruyneel of the ukrainian who won the world under-23 road race crown in 2001 .
" in general you have to be careful with young riders but he has been promising .
he managed to stay with lance in some of the final sections of the big climbs which is not easy . " for the first time in seven years , the discovery channel team will go into the tour de france as underdogs but the jury is still out on whether jan ullrich will be the favorite for the race in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .
here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why . the " squirrel campaign " was a success and dieter knappmann is visibly proud of the fact .
what sounds so conspiratorial actually worked according to a very simple principle .
every spd member in the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck was urged to recruit new members for the party in their own circles . " you really approached everyone you knew and tried to convince them , " says chapter chairman knappmann .
the plan worked .
following a wave of party departures three years ago , the local chapter in this working class neighborhood is proud to have swelled to 220 members in the meantime .
there 's also been a change in generations as more young people get involved in the party , knappmann explains . the spd in brauck is doing better than elsewhere , where many chapters have had to merge due to dwindling membership .
it 's all a question of roots and " whether you really want to be the advocate of the people , " says the 60-year-old , who 's been on the chapter 's board for 33 years . running out of breath knappmann looks forward to the election campaign quite calmly .
" our philosophy is that it 's actually always an election campaign , " says knappmann .
" a lot of our activities were already planned before we knew there would be early elections .
now , they 're taking place right during the campaign . " in brauck , everything is ready " from the stands to the assignment of the polling stations . "
but here , like other parts of the ruhr basin , the core base is tired .
following a rapid string of european , municipal and state elections , the chapter sees itself campaigning for the fourth time in just over a year .
" we are running out of breath , " knappmann adds . where 's the fire ? still , knappmann thinks early elections are a good thing .
for him , the ideal result would be a grand coalition between the spd and the conservative opposition christian democrats .
" that would be the only way to solve the societal problems , " he says . knappmann says he does n't understand other spd members who turn away from the party because they claim they can no longer identify themselves with it .
" we 're not happy with everything , but you 're either committed to the basic values of social democracy or you were just a follower anyway , " says knappmann . recalling an apt quote to describe the situation , the party chairman says , " tradition is preserving the fire and not revering the ashes . "
at the moment , though , " there 's no one to ignite that fire . " christiane wolters -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fighting for the heart of the spd the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations .
the unionist it 's been a long time , but the memory is still alive .
as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore .
the young spd member sebastian kolkau heads up the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt .

he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt . sebastian kolkau only knows willy brandt from anecdotes , and he doesn ’ t see the one-time idol of social democrats as a role model for the young generation today .
" at least i 've never heard anyone at the jusos say ' i want to be like willy brandt ' , " says kolkau , who ponders whether everything really was better in the spd back in those days .
who can say ? " we only hear the stories , but no one knows what it was really like , " he surmises . it 's the ideas that count the 26-year-old head of the jusos in gelsenkirchen does n't believe that it 's up to individuals to make the spd strong again .
the contents are more important , he says .
" people need to regain confidence in the spd and in order to do that , you need ideas , " argues kolkau .
" if schröder would recite the election manifesto , it would not be authentic because in the past years , he just did too little of what is in it . " according to kolkau , a change in party personnel might be the right thing for a new beginning . anger and ambivalence after five years , kolkau still enjoys working for the party .
but it has its ups and downs , he admits .
the downside includes standing on the street campaigning for the spd or jusos while people walk by yelling out their anger at him .
he has to hear " damn spd " or " you cutthroats " even though he ca n't do anything about the decisions made in berlin .

as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore . dietmar bartsch is n't used to asking himself such questions .
for a long time , there was no room for doubt : he was a member of the social democrats and he voted the party line . the 42-year-old miner has been an active unionist and a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for 18 years .
one thing led to another - " the usual stuff , " said bartsch referring to how he first got involved in the party . what used to be " usual " in the ruhr basin has increasingly turned into the exception .
in the 1950s , some 500,000 people worked in coal mining ; and party activism was simply part of the working class culture .
today , that number has shrunk to 40,000 .
and even fewer people are interested in getting politically involved . voter turnout in the region leaves much to be desired - and the spd feels the decline most of all .

3 .
tehran , however , wants action before that date or it will go its own way . the european union will offer iran a package of measures in early august to encourage tehran to respect its nuclear commitments once its new president has been sworn in , an eu official said on tuesday . the package , which basically offers trade incentives to iran for concessions on its nuclear ambitions , will probably be presented in the first week of the month by the eu 's negotiating triumvirate ; germany , france and britain , after hardliner mahmood ahmadinejad takes office on august 3 . " then we have to hear the reaction , " the official said .
" we can not call for a round of talks -lrb- with iran -rrb- before the package has been presented . " the official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said talks would not take place until several weeks after the package is offered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer -lrb- r . -rrb- and jack straw the package , based on an agreement reached between iran and the eu has three key elements : nuclear issues , political and security issues , and economic and technological cooperation . the official said the bulk of the offer had already been shown to eu foreign ministers and was almost completed , but would provide no details on what it contained . iran wants action before eu 's set date however , iran responded to the news by saying the european union had until august 1 to present a proposal that would enable the country to produce nuclear fuel or tehran will go its own way , a senior iranian official said .
ali aghamohammadi , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told state television there could be no backtracking on the right to atomic fuel . " we have told the europeans that there should not be any delay in submitting their proposals , " aghamohammadi said .
" after aug.1 we will make our decision . " aghamohammadi reiterated that iran had every right to master the production of nuclear fuel and that there is no way tehran will give this up as a diplomatic gesture .
" some minimum requirements should be considered in the proposal , " he said .
" otherwise we will not accept it . " " lifting parts of the suspension is part of the minimum requirements , " he said . new president 's stance on nukes still unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der neue iranische präsident mahmud ahmadinedschad grüßt journalisten vor einer pressekonferenz am 26.05.2005 in teheran .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 fighting for the heart of the spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pit frame in the ruhr basin : a relic from the past the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations . the furnaces may have been extinguished and most of the coal mines shut down , but the ruhr basin in western germany is still undeniably a working class region .
although workers gritty and smudged with coal dust are few and far between , the area ’ s industrial past continues to shape its people and landscape to this day . in the postwar years , coal mining and steel manufacture were integral to germany 's economic recovery .
in the densely populated ruhr basin , the heavy industry meant an almost certain guarantee for employment and economic prosperity .
from all around germany and europe , workers came to the coal mines and steel mills of the " ruhrpott " in hopes of making a living .
and for decades the region flourished .
but then the economy re-oriented itself , coal became less important for the country 's progress ; and a steady decline set in as companies folded , mines closed and the industry fell into a recession .
hundreds of thousands of workers were laid off . for the last two decades , the region has worked to change itself structurally , to wean itself of its dependence on coal and attract new industries .
however , the efforts have been without major success .
in gelsenkirchen , in the heart of the ruhr basin , one in every four people is unemployed today .
pockmarked by abandoned mines and industrial ruins , the conglomeration of cities is one of the poorest in western germany . bildunterschrift : steel workers protest closures in bochum just as coal and steel were integrally connected to everyday life in the past , it was practically a law of nature that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- called the shots in the ruhr basin .
for decades , the majority of the 5.5 million inhabitants between bottrop and duisburg , oberhausen and dortmund voted red .
even in the last state elections in may , when the social democrats saw their worst postwar result in north rhine-westphalia since 1954 , the spd remained the strongest party in the region . but the people on the party basis see trouble brewing ahead , and they are tired , worn-out from campaigning .
even longtime spd members are asking themselves if it 's even worth it to vote for their party - let alone rub their hands sore for the spd in the september elections . and if the core of the party is skeptical , what does that say about the spd 's chances as a whole ?
what do the grass-root members think about chancellor gerhard schröder and his policies ?
what are the expectations of the one-time heart of the party in this campaign ?
dw-world visited three spd members in the ruhr basin . christiane wolters -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the unionist it 's been a long time , but the memory is still alive .
as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore .
the young spd member sebastian kolkau heads up the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt .

but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .

" police investigators had argued that the law , which allows tapping of phones even when there is no suspicion of criminal activity , is an important tool in the anti-terror fight .
the decision is a victory for civil rights activists , who are worried that recent terrorist attacks in london and sharm al-sheik could lead to increased security measures at the expense of personal freedom . success breeds imitation such measures could come sooner rather than later in cities across europe .
based on the success video survillance equipment has had in helping london police track down terrorism suspects linked to the recent bombings , several european governments are mulling more aggressive public surveillance measures . in france , interior minister nicolas sarkozy announced on monday that cameras would be installed by the end of the year in more than 4,000 buses . sarkozy also said an anti-terrorist law , containing plans for video surveillance and collection of telephone data , would be introduced to parliament after the summer recess and is expected to be adopted before christmas . in germany , the city of berlin and the regional government of brandenburg have announced plans to add cameras to the existing network covering public transport and to maintain an older archive of video footage .

cities like moscow , rome and berlin and mulling installing more subway video cameras . the london attacks , which killed 52 people and the four suicide bombers on july 7 on the london underground system and a double-decker bus , have also persauded moscow to install a network of video cameras in its metro system : " within a year and a half every carriage of the metro will have one " , said the head of the moscow metro dmitri gaiev . surveillance of mobile telephone networks , which will allow authorities to identify callers , receivers and locations , will also be reinforced .
a number of governments , including france , have asked mobile telephone network operators to archive all these elements for a year , while stopping short of taping conversations . more police control over mobile phones similar measures are also being considered by spain , where police would also like to remove the anonymity of the 24 million spaniards and residents , who use pre-paid mobile telephone cards . this type of card was used by the bombers of the madrid suburban rail network in 2004 . mobile telephones were used to set off the bombs used in those attacks in which 191 people died .
last week , the italian government brought in a new regulation which requires people buying computer chips for mobile telephones to provide proof of identity . greek minister for public order george voulgarakis has asked mobile network operators to establish procedures to provide police with rapid access to mobile telephone call information and called for european legislation which harmonises this type of system across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy , germany and other countries have introduced biometric passports the introduction of biometric passports , which use physical identification markers such as fingerprints or eye scans , will also be accelerated following the london bombings .
the european union has already said these types of passports will be obligatory within three years .
scandinavian countries staying the same in most countries the opposition to these types of security measures is facing an uphill battle following the two sets of bomb attacks in london and the latest attack on the red sea resort of sharm el-sheik in egypt , which killed 88 people last saturday . in italy , an opinion poll published ten days after the london bombings found that 74 percent of those surveyed were in favor of more security cameras in public places and 60 percent support tighter surveillance of electronic messages . however there remains opposition to this increased government intrusion into people 's private lives .
in denmark , a country often threatened in al-qaeda statements on the internet , a bill to increase police powers of surveillance was rejected by parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2005 the dalai lama 's biggest german fan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two have been friends for 20 years the dalai lama makes his second trip to germany in two months to visit one of his biggest fans , the conservative governor of hesse .
both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .
the official occasion is the peace prize koch will present tibet 's spiritual and political leader on wednesday as an accolade for his peaceful campaign to maintain his country 's autonomy from china .
" i think the tibetan people need friends , because the peaceful way to change a world that is marked by political interests and power games is especially difficult , " he said .
" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .
the official occasion is the peace prize koch will present tibet 's spiritual and political leader on wednesday as an accolade for his peaceful campaign to maintain his country 's autonomy from china .
" i think the tibetan people need friends , because the peaceful way to change a world that is marked by political interests and power games is especially difficult , " he said .
" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .
the official occasion is the peace prize koch will present tibet 's spiritual and political leader on wednesday as an accolade for his peaceful campaign to maintain his country 's autonomy from china .
" i think the tibetan people need friends , because the peaceful way to change a world that is marked by political interests and power games is especially difficult , " he said .
" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .
angela merkel , a christian democratic union colleague of koch and the party 's chancellor candidate has already hinted relations with beijing wo n't be as cozy should she , as expected , become chancellor this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tibetan monk prays behind the tibetan flag during a ceremony at in dharamsala in march to commemorate the 46th anniversary of national tibetan uprising against china .
" we can see from the u.s. example that one can , on the basis of a close relationship with china , clearly formulate the principles of human rights as well as cultural and religious autonomy , " he said .
" and i believe a national government here in germany should do no more and no less than to promote just that .

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .

he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race . " he 's already very involved , " said team manager johan bruyneel .
" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .

the official occasion is the peace prize koch will present tibet 's spiritual and political leader on wednesday as an accolade for his peaceful campaign to maintain his country 's autonomy from china .
" i think the tibetan people need friends , because the peaceful way to change a world that is marked by political interests and power games is especially difficult , " he said .
" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .

" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2005 luxury brightens dark retail landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury is hot , mid-market is so last year mid-range german retailers have been singing the blues for years .
consumers remain stubbornly reluctant to spend .
but the luxury sector is all smiles these days .
gucci and co. are booming . for large retailers who serve the mid-range market , the news just keeps getting worse .
germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt department store one of the country 's biggest department store chains , karstadtquelle , lost more than 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- last year and its emergency cost-cutting plan cost 5,500 jobs . german brand names that have been fixtures of middle-class life , such as appliance makers aeg and miele , are cutting thousands of jobs .
relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance . " the mid-range is suffering , but luxury brands are in demand and people are spending a lot of money on them , " said ulrich binnebössel , spokesman for the hde retail association . luxury in style while the karstadts of the retail sector are closing underperforming stores , berlin 's galeries lafayette , the high-end french department store on one of the capital 's luxury shopping streets , friedrichstrasse , is adding another floor and plans on featuring more designer labels , which will cost a pretty penny . " we 're reacting to a brisk demand , " thierry prevost , the store 's director , said in an interview , adding that store sales had increased by 25 percent in both 2004 and 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model takes the catwalk on a recreated trevi 's fountain during the dolce & gabbana fall / winter 2004/2005 fashion collection , presented in milan , italy .
other high-end retailers report similar developments .
the exclusive quartier 206 , just down the street from galeries lafayette and housing names such as comme des garcons , dolce & gabbana -lrb- photo -rrb- and prada , reports double-digit growth . kadewe , the western berlin shopping mecca and tourist magnet , is putting the emphasis on luxury , seeing it as a way out of the general retail malaise .
the store has rebuilt its " luxury boulevard " on the ground floor , giving a more prominent place to designer names such as louis vuitton and gucci . " in general we have the feeling that high-end brands perform better than the broad mid-range , " said petra fladenhofer , spokeswoman for kadewe .
" the luxury boulevard has developed very successfully . " tourists eager to buy but it 's not as if berliners have suddenly developed a taste for the finer things in life .
the german capital is traditionally a fairly working-class kind of town .
with its high unemployment rate and serious economic enervation , the latest hermès scarf or helmut lang shoes are not exactly near the top of most residents ' shopping lists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists stroll near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but berlin 's tourist industry is booming and visitors are the ones who make up a good portion of the luxury shoppers .
at galeries lafayette , 40 percent of the customer base is made up of tourists . the same applies to quartier 206 .
the other 60 percent of their clientele , germans , generally have made a special trip to berlin to go shopping .
at kadewe 's luxury mile , a full half of those snapping up the one-of-a-kind , extremely pricey products were foreign tourists . most companies agree that the russians are the nationality most represented among these image-conscious visitors .
in fact , according to the berlin 's tourism office , the number of russian tourists increased by 22 percent in the first four months of 2005 .
many of them have money to burn and taste for the flashy . " most tourists come from eastern europe , russia and poland , and when they spend money , wow ! " said angela contzen , a spokeswoman for departmentstore in quartier 206 .
close on their heels are the americans , she added . strong at both ends , weak in the middle binnebössel from hde retail association says while the high-end is performing well , another sector is also booming : the discounters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not luxury brands , but wildly popular grocery stores like aldi and lidl , with low overhead , limited selections and cut-rate prices , are enjoying a brisk business . while he admits that germany 's poor economic climate has kept people from going on shopping sprees , according to him , it 's not only a lack of money that is drawing people to the low-end .
it 's a simple , and very german , desire to save on certain things , like food , no matter how much money is in the bank account . " it 's often the case that one drives with one 's mercedes to the discount store to shop for cheap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same phenomenon is helping the high-end as well , as the trend to mix and match luxury and discount items catches on , the " crossover look . "
shoppers save money on no-name jeans and a simple top , but then splurge for designer shoes or a bag . " and it has to be the ‘ it ' bag , very expensive , " said departmentstore 's contzen .

consumers remain stubbornly reluctant to spend .
but the luxury sector is all smiles these days .
gucci and co. are booming . for large retailers who serve the mid-range market , the news just keeps getting worse .
germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt department store one of the country 's biggest department store chains , karstadtquelle , lost more than 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- last year and its emergency cost-cutting plan cost 5,500 jobs . german brand names that have been fixtures of middle-class life , such as appliance makers aeg and miele , are cutting thousands of jobs .
relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance . " the mid-range is suffering , but luxury brands are in demand and people are spending a lot of money on them , " said ulrich binnebössel , spokesman for the hde retail association . luxury in style while the karstadts of the retail sector are closing underperforming stores , berlin 's galeries lafayette , the high-end french department store on one of the capital 's luxury shopping streets , friedrichstrasse , is adding another floor and plans on featuring more designer labels , which will cost a pretty penny . " we 're reacting to a brisk demand , " thierry prevost , the store 's director , said in an interview , adding that store sales had increased by 25 percent in both 2004 and 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model takes the catwalk on a recreated trevi 's fountain during the dolce & gabbana fall / winter 2004/2005 fashion collection , presented in milan , italy .
other high-end retailers report similar developments .
the exclusive quartier 206 , just down the street from galeries lafayette and housing names such as comme des garcons , dolce & gabbana -lrb- photo -rrb- and prada , reports double-digit growth . kadewe , the western berlin shopping mecca and tourist magnet , is putting the emphasis on luxury , seeing it as a way out of the general retail malaise .
the store has rebuilt its " luxury boulevard " on the ground floor , giving a more prominent place to designer names such as louis vuitton and gucci . " in general we have the feeling that high-end brands perform better than the broad mid-range , " said petra fladenhofer , spokeswoman for kadewe .
" the luxury boulevard has developed very successfully . " tourists eager to buy but it 's not as if berliners have suddenly developed a taste for the finer things in life .
the german capital is traditionally a fairly working-class kind of town .
with its high unemployment rate and serious economic enervation , the latest hermès scarf or helmut lang shoes are not exactly near the top of most residents ' shopping lists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists stroll near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but berlin 's tourist industry is booming and visitors are the ones who make up a good portion of the luxury shoppers .
at galeries lafayette , 40 percent of the customer base is made up of tourists . the same applies to quartier 206 .
the other 60 percent of their clientele , germans , generally have made a special trip to berlin to go shopping .
at kadewe 's luxury mile , a full half of those snapping up the one-of-a-kind , extremely pricey products were foreign tourists . most companies agree that the russians are the nationality most represented among these image-conscious visitors .
in fact , according to the berlin 's tourism office , the number of russian tourists increased by 22 percent in the first four months of 2005 .
many of them have money to burn and taste for the flashy . " most tourists come from eastern europe , russia and poland , and when they spend money , wow ! " said angela contzen , a spokeswoman for departmentstore in quartier 206 .
close on their heels are the americans , she added . strong at both ends , weak in the middle binnebössel from hde retail association says while the high-end is performing well , another sector is also booming : the discounters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not luxury brands , but wildly popular grocery stores like aldi and lidl , with low overhead , limited selections and cut-rate prices , are enjoying a brisk business . while he admits that germany 's poor economic climate has kept people from going on shopping sprees , according to him , it 's not only a lack of money that is drawing people to the low-end .
it 's a simple , and very german , desire to save on certain things , like food , no matter how much money is in the bank account . " it 's often the case that one drives with one 's mercedes to the discount store to shop for cheap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same phenomenon is helping the high-end as well , as the trend to mix and match luxury and discount items catches on , the " crossover look . "
shoppers save money on no-name jeans and a simple top , but then splurge for designer shoes or a bag . " and it has to be the ‘ it ' bag , very expensive , " said departmentstore 's contzen .

but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .
here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why . the " squirrel campaign " was a success and dieter knappmann is visibly proud of the fact .
what sounds so conspiratorial actually worked according to a very simple principle .
every spd member in the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck was urged to recruit new members for the party in their own circles . " you really approached everyone you knew and tried to convince them , " says chapter chairman knappmann .
the plan worked .
following a wave of party departures three years ago , the local chapter in this working class neighborhood is proud to have swelled to 220 members in the meantime .
there 's also been a change in generations as more young people get involved in the party , knappmann explains . the spd in brauck is doing better than elsewhere , where many chapters have had to merge due to dwindling membership .
it 's all a question of roots and " whether you really want to be the advocate of the people , " says the 60-year-old , who 's been on the chapter 's board for 33 years . running out of breath knappmann looks forward to the election campaign quite calmly .
" our philosophy is that it 's actually always an election campaign , " says knappmann .
" a lot of our activities were already planned before we knew there would be early elections .
now , they 're taking place right during the campaign . " in brauck , everything is ready " from the stands to the assignment of the polling stations . "

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .

he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .

" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race .

what sounds so conspiratorial actually worked according to a very simple principle .
every spd member in the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck was urged to recruit new members for the party in their own circles . " you really approached everyone you knew and tried to convince them , " says chapter chairman knappmann .
the plan worked .
following a wave of party departures three years ago , the local chapter in this working class neighborhood is proud to have swelled to 220 members in the meantime .
there 's also been a change in generations as more young people get involved in the party , knappmann explains . the spd in brauck is doing better than elsewhere , where many chapters have had to merge due to dwindling membership .
it 's all a question of roots and " whether you really want to be the advocate of the people , " says the 60-year-old , who 's been on the chapter 's board for 33 years . running out of breath knappmann looks forward to the election campaign quite calmly .
" our philosophy is that it 's actually always an election campaign , " says knappmann .
" a lot of our activities were already planned before we knew there would be early elections .
now , they 're taking place right during the campaign . " in brauck , everything is ready " from the stands to the assignment of the polling stations . "
but here , like other parts of the ruhr basin , the core base is tired .
following a rapid string of european , municipal and state elections , the chapter sees itself campaigning for the fourth time in just over a year .
" we are running out of breath , " knappmann adds . where 's the fire ? still , knappmann thinks early elections are a good thing .
for him , the ideal result would be a grand coalition between the spd and the conservative opposition christian democrats .
" that would be the only way to solve the societal problems , " he says . knappmann says he does n't understand other spd members who turn away from the party because they claim they can no longer identify themselves with it .
" we 're not happy with everything , but you 're either committed to the basic values of social democracy or you were just a follower anyway , " says knappmann . recalling an apt quote to describe the situation , the party chairman says , " tradition is preserving the fire and not revering the ashes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2005 infineon 's troubles keep growing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infineon has slipped far into the red infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .
the financial bad news comes on the heels of a corruption scandal . in a telephone news conference on tuesday , infineon head wolfgang ziebart said the " unsatisfactory results " were due to memory chip prices that have fallen 30 percent .
mobile phone manufacturers are also buying fewer components from the munich-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ziebart , ceo of infineon technologies " i do n't think it will be possible to attain a positive operating result this year , " ziebart said .
the company 's fiscal year ends in september . infineon had posted a third-quarter loss earlier in the day owing to both the fall in memory chip prices and restructuring costs linked to the closure of a plant in munich .
the company said earnings before interest and tax showed a loss of 234 million euros -lrb- $ 282 million -rrb- , compared with a profit of two million euros in the same period one year earlier . analysts had expected a loss of between 80-225 million euros .
the group 's net loss widened to 240 million euros from a loss of 56 million , much worse than forecasts that ranged from 75 to 187 million in losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profit and loss estimates among chip makers are difficult to estimate because chip prices themselves can change quickly , depending on demand .
all of the big players in the sector , amd , samsung and infineon , are struggling because of fierce pricing wars .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt . " we also wo n't send any german soldiers to iraq , " gerhardt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election issues : what 's at stake dw-world takes you through the hot-button issues , explaining what 's really at stake in this election and how the parties line-up across the spectrum .

germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .

germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .

" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .

he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt . sebastian kolkau only knows willy brandt from anecdotes , and he doesn ’ t see the one-time idol of social democrats as a role model for the young generation today .
" at least i 've never heard anyone at the jusos say ' i want to be like willy brandt ' , " says kolkau , who ponders whether everything really was better in the spd back in those days .
who can say ? " we only hear the stories , but no one knows what it was really like , " he surmises . it 's the ideas that count the 26-year-old head of the jusos in gelsenkirchen does n't believe that it 's up to individuals to make the spd strong again .

" if schröder would recite the election manifesto , it would not be authentic because in the past years , he just did too little of what is in it .

the downside includes standing on the street campaigning for the spd or jusos while people walk by yelling out their anger at him .
he has to hear " damn spd " or " you cutthroats " even though he ca n't do anything about the decisions made in berlin . " it ’ s really ambivalent for me because you stand there and think , actually they ’ re right , " says kolkau . maybe kolkau will one day find himself in a position where he 's responsible for political policies , as a representative in the state or federal parliament .
he says he could envision such a position , even if he wouldn ’ t go so far as to call it his dream .
first , he wants to finish his business degree and go from there .
he certainly has enough to do on the side : for the jusos and as a research associate in the office of a member of parliament in gelsenkirchen . as for working for a party that currently holds the " loser image " ?

" but what else can we do ? "
he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?
" has any of them ever really gotten their hands dirty ?

as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore . dietmar bartsch is n't used to asking himself such questions .
for a long time , there was no room for doubt : he was a member of the social democrats and he voted the party line . the 42-year-old miner has been an active unionist and a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for 18 years .
one thing led to another - " the usual stuff , " said bartsch referring to how he first got involved in the party . what used to be " usual " in the ruhr basin has increasingly turned into the exception .
in the 1950s , some 500,000 people worked in coal mining ; and party activism was simply part of the working class culture .
today , that number has shrunk to 40,000 .
and even fewer people are interested in getting politically involved . voter turnout in the region leaves much to be desired - and the spd feels the decline most of all .
in the past , everything ran like a well-oiled machine .
today , the party has trouble mobilizing its once regular voters : the miners and factory workers . no more hands-on work bartsch has witnessed first-hand the changes .
sitting in his office at the auguste-victoria mine in marl since five o 'clock in the morning , he reflects on the party 's past and its chances for the future . the previous evening had been a late one .
bartsch was at an spd meeting in his hometown of recklinghausen .
and , as is the case whenever " comrades " meet these days , all talk was focused on the upcoming early elections in september .
bartsch says he feels " a mixture of resignation and hope " in view of yet another election campaign , just two months after losing the state elections in north rhine-westphalia . " no one seriously expects a victory , " he sighs .
" but what else can we do ? "
he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?
" has any of them ever really gotten their hands dirty ? " nonetheless , the unionist and long-time spd member concedes that reforms are necessary and will continue to be important for the future . lots of " basta , " little substance but bartsch criticizes party heads for the approach they take to problem-solving .

dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations . the furnaces may have been extinguished and most of the coal mines shut down , but the ruhr basin in western germany is still undeniably a working class region .
although workers gritty and smudged with coal dust are few and far between , the area ’ s industrial past continues to shape its people and landscape to this day . in the postwar years , coal mining and steel manufacture were integral to germany 's economic recovery .
in the densely populated ruhr basin , the heavy industry meant an almost certain guarantee for employment and economic prosperity .

" police investigators had argued that the law , which allows tapping of phones even when there is no suspicion of criminal activity , is an important tool in the anti-terror fight .
the decision is a victory for civil rights activists , who are worried that recent terrorist attacks in london and sharm al-sheik could lead to increased security measures at the expense of personal freedom . success breeds imitation such measures could come sooner rather than later in cities across europe .
based on the success video survillance equipment has had in helping london police track down terrorism suspects linked to the recent bombings , several european governments are mulling more aggressive public surveillance measures . in france , interior minister nicolas sarkozy announced on monday that cameras would be installed by the end of the year in more than 4,000 buses . sarkozy also said an anti-terrorist law , containing plans for video surveillance and collection of telephone data , would be introduced to parliament after the summer recess and is expected to be adopted before christmas . in germany , the city of berlin and the regional government of brandenburg have announced plans to add cameras to the existing network covering public transport and to maintain an older archive of video footage . " after the attacks on the british capital , we do n't want to be criticized for not adequately responding , " said berlin public transports company -lrb- bvg -rrb- chief thomas necker . rome , moscow promise more and better cameras in italy , which has been regularly threatened in internet messages by groups claiming links to the radical islamist organisation al-qaeda , a million surveillance cameras are already in place and the government has decided to install more and of better quality , particularly in the rome metro . bildunterschrift : these cctv images of the london bombers have led to arrests .
cities like moscow , rome and berlin and mulling installing more subway video cameras . the london attacks , which killed 52 people and the four suicide bombers on july 7 on the london underground system and a double-decker bus , have also persauded moscow to install a network of video cameras in its metro system : " within a year and a half every carriage of the metro will have one " , said the head of the moscow metro dmitri gaiev . surveillance of mobile telephone networks , which will allow authorities to identify callers , receivers and locations , will also be reinforced .
a number of governments , including france , have asked mobile telephone network operators to archive all these elements for a year , while stopping short of taping conversations . more police control over mobile phones similar measures are also being considered by spain , where police would also like to remove the anonymity of the 24 million spaniards and residents , who use pre-paid mobile telephone cards . this type of card was used by the bombers of the madrid suburban rail network in 2004 . mobile telephones were used to set off the bombs used in those attacks in which 191 people died .
last week , the italian government brought in a new regulation which requires people buying computer chips for mobile telephones to provide proof of identity . greek minister for public order george voulgarakis has asked mobile network operators to establish procedures to provide police with rapid access to mobile telephone call information and called for european legislation which harmonises this type of system across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy , germany and other countries have introduced biometric passports the introduction of biometric passports , which use physical identification markers such as fingerprints or eye scans , will also be accelerated following the london bombings .
the european union has already said these types of passports will be obligatory within three years .
scandinavian countries staying the same in most countries the opposition to these types of security measures is facing an uphill battle following the two sets of bomb attacks in london and the latest attack on the red sea resort of sharm el-sheik in egypt , which killed 88 people last saturday . in italy , an opinion poll published ten days after the london bombings found that 74 percent of those surveyed were in favor of more security cameras in public places and 60 percent support tighter surveillance of electronic messages . however there remains opposition to this increased government intrusion into people 's private lives .
in denmark , a country often threatened in al-qaeda statements on the internet , a bill to increase police powers of surveillance was rejected by parliament . " the citizens must be able to move around in peace , " said ruling liberal party spokeswoman birthe roenn hornbech . in sweden , which has far less video surveillance of public places than britain , a recent study concluded that the current system works well and does not need to be expanded , according to justice ministry advisor maria kelt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2005 luxury brightens dark retail landscape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury is hot , mid-market is so last year mid-range german retailers have been singing the blues for years .
consumers remain stubbornly reluctant to spend .
but the luxury sector is all smiles these days .
gucci and co. are booming . for large retailers who serve the mid-range market , the news just keeps getting worse .
germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt department store one of the country 's biggest department store chains , karstadtquelle , lost more than 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- last year and its emergency cost-cutting plan cost 5,500 jobs . german brand names that have been fixtures of middle-class life , such as appliance makers aeg and miele , are cutting thousands of jobs .
relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance . " the mid-range is suffering , but luxury brands are in demand and people are spending a lot of money on them , " said ulrich binnebössel , spokesman for the hde retail association . luxury in style while the karstadts of the retail sector are closing underperforming stores , berlin 's galeries lafayette , the high-end french department store on one of the capital 's luxury shopping streets , friedrichstrasse , is adding another floor and plans on featuring more designer labels , which will cost a pretty penny . " we 're reacting to a brisk demand , " thierry prevost , the store 's director , said in an interview , adding that store sales had increased by 25 percent in both 2004 and 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model takes the catwalk on a recreated trevi 's fountain during the dolce & gabbana fall / winter 2004/2005 fashion collection , presented in milan , italy .
other high-end retailers report similar developments .
the exclusive quartier 206 , just down the street from galeries lafayette and housing names such as comme des garcons , dolce & gabbana -lrb- photo -rrb- and prada , reports double-digit growth . kadewe , the western berlin shopping mecca and tourist magnet , is putting the emphasis on luxury , seeing it as a way out of the general retail malaise .
the store has rebuilt its " luxury boulevard " on the ground floor , giving a more prominent place to designer names such as louis vuitton and gucci . " in general we have the feeling that high-end brands perform better than the broad mid-range , " said petra fladenhofer , spokeswoman for kadewe .
" the luxury boulevard has developed very successfully . " tourists eager to buy but it 's not as if berliners have suddenly developed a taste for the finer things in life .
the german capital is traditionally a fairly working-class kind of town .
with its high unemployment rate and serious economic enervation , the latest hermès scarf or helmut lang shoes are not exactly near the top of most residents ' shopping lists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists stroll near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but berlin 's tourist industry is booming and visitors are the ones who make up a good portion of the luxury shoppers .
at galeries lafayette , 40 percent of the customer base is made up of tourists . the same applies to quartier 206 .
the other 60 percent of their clientele , germans , generally have made a special trip to berlin to go shopping .
at kadewe 's luxury mile , a full half of those snapping up the one-of-a-kind , extremely pricey products were foreign tourists . most companies agree that the russians are the nationality most represented among these image-conscious visitors .
in fact , according to the berlin 's tourism office , the number of russian tourists increased by 22 percent in the first four months of 2005 .
many of them have money to burn and taste for the flashy . " most tourists come from eastern europe , russia and poland , and when they spend money , wow ! " said angela contzen , a spokeswoman for departmentstore in quartier 206 .
close on their heels are the americans , she added . strong at both ends , weak in the middle binnebössel from hde retail association says while the high-end is performing well , another sector is also booming : the discounters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not luxury brands , but wildly popular grocery stores like aldi and lidl , with low overhead , limited selections and cut-rate prices , are enjoying a brisk business . while he admits that germany 's poor economic climate has kept people from going on shopping sprees , according to him , it 's not only a lack of money that is drawing people to the low-end .
it 's a simple , and very german , desire to save on certain things , like food , no matter how much money is in the bank account . " it 's often the case that one drives with one 's mercedes to the discount store to shop for cheap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same phenomenon is helping the high-end as well , as the trend to mix and match luxury and discount items catches on , the " crossover look . "
shoppers save money on no-name jeans and a simple top , but then splurge for designer shoes or a bag . " and it has to be the ‘ it ' bag , very expensive , " said departmentstore 's contzen .

a 80-year-old nursing home resident decided he needed something from the store up the road , so he sat out for a little drive - in his wheelchair . truckers who normally barrel down the autobahn were shocked on tuesday to find a senior citizen in a motorized wheelchair sharing the freeway with them . " he wanted to go shopping at a service area up the road from his home , " said a spokeswoman for the police in the eastern town of görlitz . since the octogenarian retiree does n't own a car , he took the one motorized vehicle at his disposal , which has a top speed of about 10 kilometers per hour -lrb- 6 mph -rrb- . several passing truckers notified police and one quick-thinking driver positioned his rig behind the man and protected him from the speed demons that normally travel down germany 's largely speed-limit-free expressways . police were on hand to collect the man after he made a slow exit off the freeway that runs from dresden and the town of bautzen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2005 infineon 's troubles keep growing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infineon has slipped far into the red infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .
the financial bad news comes on the heels of a corruption scandal . in a telephone news conference on tuesday , infineon head wolfgang ziebart said the " unsatisfactory results " were due to memory chip prices that have fallen 30 percent .
mobile phone manufacturers are also buying fewer components from the munich-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ziebart , ceo of infineon technologies " i do n't think it will be possible to attain a positive operating result this year , " ziebart said .
the company 's fiscal year ends in september . infineon had posted a third-quarter loss earlier in the day owing to both the fall in memory chip prices and restructuring costs linked to the closure of a plant in munich .
the company said earnings before interest and tax showed a loss of 234 million euros -lrb- $ 282 million -rrb- , compared with a profit of two million euros in the same period one year earlier . analysts had expected a loss of between 80-225 million euros .
the group 's net loss widened to 240 million euros from a loss of 56 million , much worse than forecasts that ranged from 75 to 187 million in losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profit and loss estimates among chip makers are difficult to estimate because chip prices themselves can change quickly , depending on demand .
all of the big players in the sector , amd , samsung and infineon , are struggling because of fierce pricing wars .
the german association zvei , which follows the sector , has recently cut its growth estimate for 2005 from three to one percent . but the german semi-conductor maker said it expected memory chip prices to remain stable in the fourth quarter as worldwide demand increases were matched by only moderate supply growth . scandal not to blame ziebart said the on-going investigation into the corruption scandal did not have any effect on the chipmaker 's performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von zitzewitz ten days ago , andreas von zitzewitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , manager of infineon 's core memory chip unit , resigned amid allegations that he received kickbacks of up to 259,000 euros -lrb- $ 312,000 -rrb- for arranging racing sponsorship deals .
another executive , harald eggers , is also under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks of up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- . ziebert said he was " interested in a thorough investigation of the matter " and assured the prosecutor 's office the company 's full cooperation , but he added : " i would have liked for both my colleagues and myself to be spared this .

corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt .
-lrb- july 23 , 2005 -rrb- infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .
the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .
the official occasion is the peace prize koch will present tibet 's spiritual and political leader on wednesday as an accolade for his peaceful campaign to maintain his country 's autonomy from china .
" i think the tibetan people need friends , because the peaceful way to change a world that is marked by political interests and power games is especially difficult , " he said .
" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .
angela merkel , a christian democratic union colleague of koch and the party 's chancellor candidate has already hinted relations with beijing wo n't be as cozy should she , as expected , become chancellor this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tibetan monk prays behind the tibetan flag during a ceremony at in dharamsala in march to commemorate the 46th anniversary of national tibetan uprising against china .
" we can see from the u.s. example that one can , on the basis of a close relationship with china , clearly formulate the principles of human rights as well as cultural and religious autonomy , " he said .
" and i believe a national government here in germany should do no more and no less than to promote just that .

the financial bad news comes on the heels of a corruption scandal . in a telephone news conference on tuesday , infineon head wolfgang ziebart said the " unsatisfactory results " were due to memory chip prices that have fallen 30 percent .
mobile phone manufacturers are also buying fewer components from the munich-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ziebart , ceo of infineon technologies " i do n't think it will be possible to attain a positive operating result this year , " ziebart said .
the company 's fiscal year ends in september . infineon had posted a third-quarter loss earlier in the day owing to both the fall in memory chip prices and restructuring costs linked to the closure of a plant in munich .
the company said earnings before interest and tax showed a loss of 234 million euros -lrb- $ 282 million -rrb- , compared with a profit of two million euros in the same period one year earlier . analysts had expected a loss of between 80-225 million euros .

another executive , harald eggers , is also under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks of up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- . ziebert said he was " interested in a thorough investigation of the matter " and assured the prosecutor 's office the company 's full cooperation , but he added : " i would have liked for both my colleagues and myself to be spared this .

every spd member in the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck was urged to recruit new members for the party in their own circles . " you really approached everyone you knew and tried to convince them , " says chapter chairman knappmann .
the plan worked .
following a wave of party departures three years ago , the local chapter in this working class neighborhood is proud to have swelled to 220 members in the meantime .
there 's also been a change in generations as more young people get involved in the party , knappmann explains . the spd in brauck is doing better than elsewhere , where many chapters have had to merge due to dwindling membership .

for him , the ideal result would be a grand coalition between the spd and the conservative opposition christian democrats .
" that would be the only way to solve the societal problems , " he says . knappmann says he does n't understand other spd members who turn away from the party because they claim they can no longer identify themselves with it .
" we 're not happy with everything , but you 're either committed to the basic values of social democracy or you were just a follower anyway , " says knappmann . recalling an apt quote to describe the situation , the party chairman says , " tradition is preserving the fire and not revering the ashes .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt . " we also wo n't send any german soldiers to iraq , " gerhardt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election issues : what 's at stake dw-world takes you through the hot-button issues , explaining what 's really at stake in this election and how the parties line-up across the spectrum .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt . " we also wo n't send any german soldiers to iraq , " gerhardt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election issues : what 's at stake dw-world takes you through the hot-button issues , explaining what 's really at stake in this election and how the parties line-up across the spectrum .

the downside includes standing on the street campaigning for the spd or jusos while people walk by yelling out their anger at him .
he has to hear " damn spd " or " you cutthroats " even though he ca n't do anything about the decisions made in berlin . " it ’ s really ambivalent for me because you stand there and think , actually they ’ re right , " says kolkau . maybe kolkau will one day find himself in a position where he 's responsible for political policies , as a representative in the state or federal parliament .
he says he could envision such a position , even if he wouldn ’ t go so far as to call it his dream .

he certainly has enough to do on the side : for the jusos and as a research associate in the office of a member of parliament in gelsenkirchen . as for working for a party that currently holds the " loser image " ?
" it ’ s not that bad in gelsenkirchen , " he says .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 the unionist großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dietmar bartsch : " mixture of hope and resignation " it 's been a long time , but the memory is still alive .
as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore . dietmar bartsch is n't used to asking himself such questions .
for a long time , there was no room for doubt : he was a member of the social democrats and he voted the party line . the 42-year-old miner has been an active unionist and a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for 18 years .
one thing led to another - " the usual stuff , " said bartsch referring to how he first got involved in the party . what used to be " usual " in the ruhr basin has increasingly turned into the exception .
in the 1950s , some 500,000 people worked in coal mining ; and party activism was simply part of the working class culture .
today , that number has shrunk to 40,000 .
and even fewer people are interested in getting politically involved . voter turnout in the region leaves much to be desired - and the spd feels the decline most of all .
in the past , everything ran like a well-oiled machine .
today , the party has trouble mobilizing its once regular voters : the miners and factory workers . no more hands-on work bartsch has witnessed first-hand the changes .
sitting in his office at the auguste-victoria mine in marl since five o 'clock in the morning , he reflects on the party 's past and its chances for the future . the previous evening had been a late one .
bartsch was at an spd meeting in his hometown of recklinghausen .
and , as is the case whenever " comrades " meet these days , all talk was focused on the upcoming early elections in september .
bartsch says he feels " a mixture of resignation and hope " in view of yet another election campaign , just two months after losing the state elections in north rhine-westphalia . " no one seriously expects a victory , " he sighs .
" but what else can we do ? "
he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?
" has any of them ever really gotten their hands dirty ? " nonetheless , the unionist and long-time spd member concedes that reforms are necessary and will continue to be important for the future . lots of " basta , " little substance but bartsch criticizes party heads for the approach they take to problem-solving .
all too often they resort to a knee-jerk , " basta " -lrb- the italian word for " that 's enough " -rrb- policy when caught in a tight spot .
reforms should n't be a form of " basta " politics from above , bartsch says .
the party leaders need to take people 's fears seriously and spend time explaining policies to them . the spd is lacking the right people for this right now , bartsch laments .
gone are the days of the great party figureheads like willy brandt , herbert wehner or helmut schmidt , " who had a social democrat heart and proudly wore it on their sleeve . " still , bartsch he will campaign for the spd , which is still his party .
" if you do n't fight , you ’ ve already lost , " he says .
but his words fall flat , lacking a fiery spirit . christiane wolters -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the young spd member sebastian kolkau heads up the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt .
fighting for the heart of the spd the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations .
the local chapter chairman the spd is battling a membership decline .
but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .
here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why .

" i am referring to the g4 resorting to financial leverage and to financial pressures in order to induce a government to align , or not to align , itself with a certain position , or to co-sponsor or vote in favor of a certain draft , " spatafora said . in dramatic fashion , he threw his support behind a rival draft introduced in the general assembly by canada on behalf of the so-called united for consensus -lrb- ufc -rrb- group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council that draft would enlarge the council to 25 seats , with 10 new non-permanent members that would be elected for two-year terms , with the possibility of immediate re-election . charging that an unnamed g4 donor country had terminated a development project valued at $ 460,000 -lrb- 370,000 euros -rrb- for a recipient country which sided with the ufc rather than with the g4 , the italian envoy said : " it is a shame ... enough is enough . " " reforms can not be dictated by power or money , " he noted .
" we have a moral obligation not to allow a reform of the security council to be decided in this unhealthy and poisoned environment . " g4 blueprint vs united for consensus resolution the contentious wrangling over security council reform has been debated for a decade and has been given momentum this year by un secretary-general kofi annan , who argues that the council is unrepresentative and reflects the balance of power at the end of world war two .
italy has long campaigned against adding new permanent members to the council .
a seat for germany would leave rome as the only big western european nation without one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 the g4 blueprint , which is backed by more than 30 countries including france and britain , calls for boosting council membership from 15 members to 25 , including six new permanent seats without veto power - one each for brazil , germany , india and japan and two for the african region . " the g4 model is structured in such a way as to benefit just six happy few , at the detriment of all the other 180 member states , and with a tremendous divisive impact on the membership , " the italian envoy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-thirds majority is needed in the 191-member general assembly for adoption .
introducing the united for consensus resolution , canada 's un ambassador allan rock called it " the fairest and most democratic approach to the complex and controversial question of security council enlargement , while seeking the broadest possible consensus on how to proceed . " he said the draft would distribute the elected 20 non-permanent seats equitably among the geographic regions and would leave each region the decision about arrangements for both the rotation of the seats and the duration of each member state 's period on the council . the document is co-sponsored by argentina , canada , colombia , costa rica , italy , malta , mexico , pakistan , south korea , san marino , spain and turkey and is a clear attempt to drain support away from the g4 text , which is facing strong opposition led by the united states . g4 plan runs into trouble pakistan is adamantly opposed to india securing permanent membership of the council , brazil 's bid is opposed by argentina and several latin american countries , japan 's by china and south korea while italy leads opposition to germany 's bid , diplomats said . at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful security council , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile g4 foreign ministers met with an africa union -lrb- au -rrb- delegation led by nigerian foreign minister olu adeniji in london monday to try to overcome differences between their rival drafts on security council enlargement . differences centered on the au 's demand for veto power for the two permanent security council seats that would be allocated to africa and for five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa . on the issue of the additional non-permanent seat sought by the africans , it was suggested that the council should be expanded to 26 members , with the 26th seat circulating among developing countries of africa , asia and latin america and the caribbean states.the g4 and the au ministers decided to refer the issue to their respective heads of state . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last chance talks for g4 un hopefuls diplomats from germany , india , japan , brazil and the african union meet in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expanding the un security council by september .

" i am referring to the g4 resorting to financial leverage and to financial pressures in order to induce a government to align , or not to align , itself with a certain position , or to co-sponsor or vote in favor of a certain draft , " spatafora said . in dramatic fashion , he threw his support behind a rival draft introduced in the general assembly by canada on behalf of the so-called united for consensus -lrb- ufc -rrb- group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council that draft would enlarge the council to 25 seats , with 10 new non-permanent members that would be elected for two-year terms , with the possibility of immediate re-election . charging that an unnamed g4 donor country had terminated a development project valued at $ 460,000 -lrb- 370,000 euros -rrb- for a recipient country which sided with the ufc rather than with the g4 , the italian envoy said : " it is a shame ... enough is enough . " " reforms can not be dictated by power or money , " he noted .
" we have a moral obligation not to allow a reform of the security council to be decided in this unhealthy and poisoned environment . " g4 blueprint vs united for consensus resolution the contentious wrangling over security council reform has been debated for a decade and has been given momentum this year by un secretary-general kofi annan , who argues that the council is unrepresentative and reflects the balance of power at the end of world war two .
italy has long campaigned against adding new permanent members to the council .
a seat for germany would leave rome as the only big western european nation without one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 the g4 blueprint , which is backed by more than 30 countries including france and britain , calls for boosting council membership from 15 members to 25 , including six new permanent seats without veto power - one each for brazil , germany , india and japan and two for the african region . " the g4 model is structured in such a way as to benefit just six happy few , at the detriment of all the other 180 member states , and with a tremendous divisive impact on the membership , " the italian envoy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-thirds majority is needed in the 191-member general assembly for adoption .
introducing the united for consensus resolution , canada 's un ambassador allan rock called it " the fairest and most democratic approach to the complex and controversial question of security council enlargement , while seeking the broadest possible consensus on how to proceed . " he said the draft would distribute the elected 20 non-permanent seats equitably among the geographic regions and would leave each region the decision about arrangements for both the rotation of the seats and the duration of each member state 's period on the council . the document is co-sponsored by argentina , canada , colombia , costa rica , italy , malta , mexico , pakistan , south korea , san marino , spain and turkey and is a clear attempt to drain support away from the g4 text , which is facing strong opposition led by the united states . g4 plan runs into trouble pakistan is adamantly opposed to india securing permanent membership of the council , brazil 's bid is opposed by argentina and several latin american countries , japan 's by china and south korea while italy leads opposition to germany 's bid , diplomats said . at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful security council , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile g4 foreign ministers met with an africa union -lrb- au -rrb- delegation led by nigerian foreign minister olu adeniji in london monday to try to overcome differences between their rival drafts on security council enlargement . differences centered on the au 's demand for veto power for the two permanent security council seats that would be allocated to africa and for five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa . on the issue of the additional non-permanent seat sought by the africans , it was suggested that the council should be expanded to 26 members , with the 26th seat circulating among developing countries of africa , asia and latin america and the caribbean states.the g4 and the au ministers decided to refer the issue to their respective heads of state . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last chance talks for g4 un hopefuls diplomats from germany , india , japan , brazil and the african union meet in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expanding the un security council by september .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 fighting for the heart of the spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pit frame in the ruhr basin : a relic from the past the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations . the furnaces may have been extinguished and most of the coal mines shut down , but the ruhr basin in western germany is still undeniably a working class region .
although workers gritty and smudged with coal dust are few and far between , the area ’ s industrial past continues to shape its people and landscape to this day . in the postwar years , coal mining and steel manufacture were integral to germany 's economic recovery .
in the densely populated ruhr basin , the heavy industry meant an almost certain guarantee for employment and economic prosperity .
from all around germany and europe , workers came to the coal mines and steel mills of the " ruhrpott " in hopes of making a living .
and for decades the region flourished .
but then the economy re-oriented itself , coal became less important for the country 's progress ; and a steady decline set in as companies folded , mines closed and the industry fell into a recession .
hundreds of thousands of workers were laid off . for the last two decades , the region has worked to change itself structurally , to wean itself of its dependence on coal and attract new industries .
however , the efforts have been without major success .
in gelsenkirchen , in the heart of the ruhr basin , one in every four people is unemployed today .
pockmarked by abandoned mines and industrial ruins , the conglomeration of cities is one of the poorest in western germany . bildunterschrift : steel workers protest closures in bochum just as coal and steel were integrally connected to everyday life in the past , it was practically a law of nature that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- called the shots in the ruhr basin .
for decades , the majority of the 5.5 million inhabitants between bottrop and duisburg , oberhausen and dortmund voted red .
even in the last state elections in may , when the social democrats saw their worst postwar result in north rhine-westphalia since 1954 , the spd remained the strongest party in the region . but the people on the party basis see trouble brewing ahead , and they are tired , worn-out from campaigning .

" police investigators had argued that the law , which allows tapping of phones even when there is no suspicion of criminal activity , is an important tool in the anti-terror fight .
the decision is a victory for civil rights activists , who are worried that recent terrorist attacks in london and sharm al-sheik could lead to increased security measures at the expense of personal freedom . success breeds imitation such measures could come sooner rather than later in cities across europe .
based on the success video survillance equipment has had in helping london police track down terrorism suspects linked to the recent bombings , several european governments are mulling more aggressive public surveillance measures . in france , interior minister nicolas sarkozy announced on monday that cameras would be installed by the end of the year in more than 4,000 buses . sarkozy also said an anti-terrorist law , containing plans for video surveillance and collection of telephone data , would be introduced to parliament after the summer recess and is expected to be adopted before christmas . in germany , the city of berlin and the regional government of brandenburg have announced plans to add cameras to the existing network covering public transport and to maintain an older archive of video footage . " after the attacks on the british capital , we do n't want to be criticized for not adequately responding , " said berlin public transports company -lrb- bvg -rrb- chief thomas necker . rome , moscow promise more and better cameras in italy , which has been regularly threatened in internet messages by groups claiming links to the radical islamist organisation al-qaeda , a million surveillance cameras are already in place and the government has decided to install more and of better quality , particularly in the rome metro . bildunterschrift : these cctv images of the london bombers have led to arrests .

a number of governments , including france , have asked mobile telephone network operators to archive all these elements for a year , while stopping short of taping conversations . more police control over mobile phones similar measures are also being considered by spain , where police would also like to remove the anonymity of the 24 million spaniards and residents , who use pre-paid mobile telephone cards . this type of card was used by the bombers of the madrid suburban rail network in 2004 . mobile telephones were used to set off the bombs used in those attacks in which 191 people died .
last week , the italian government brought in a new regulation which requires people buying computer chips for mobile telephones to provide proof of identity . greek minister for public order george voulgarakis has asked mobile network operators to establish procedures to provide police with rapid access to mobile telephone call information and called for european legislation which harmonises this type of system across the continent . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy , germany and other countries have introduced biometric passports the introduction of biometric passports , which use physical identification markers such as fingerprints or eye scans , will also be accelerated following the london bombings .
the european union has already said these types of passports will be obligatory within three years .
scandinavian countries staying the same in most countries the opposition to these types of security measures is facing an uphill battle following the two sets of bomb attacks in london and the latest attack on the red sea resort of sharm el-sheik in egypt , which killed 88 people last saturday . in italy , an opinion poll published ten days after the london bombings found that 74 percent of those surveyed were in favor of more security cameras in public places and 60 percent support tighter surveillance of electronic messages . however there remains opposition to this increased government intrusion into people 's private lives .
in denmark , a country often threatened in al-qaeda statements on the internet , a bill to increase police powers of surveillance was rejected by parliament . " the citizens must be able to move around in peace , " said ruling liberal party spokeswoman birthe roenn hornbech . in sweden , which has far less video surveillance of public places than britain , a recent study concluded that the current system works well and does not need to be expanded , according to justice ministry advisor maria kelt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2005 the dalai lama 's biggest german fan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two have been friends for 20 years the dalai lama makes his second trip to germany in two months to visit one of his biggest fans , the conservative governor of hesse .
both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .
the official occasion is the peace prize koch will present tibet 's spiritual and political leader on wednesday as an accolade for his peaceful campaign to maintain his country 's autonomy from china .
" i think the tibetan people need friends , because the peaceful way to change a world that is marked by political interests and power games is especially difficult , " he said .
" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2005 the dalai lama 's biggest german fan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two have been friends for 20 years the dalai lama makes his second trip to germany in two months to visit one of his biggest fans , the conservative governor of hesse .
both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .
the official occasion is the peace prize koch will present tibet 's spiritual and political leader on wednesday as an accolade for his peaceful campaign to maintain his country 's autonomy from china .
" i think the tibetan people need friends , because the peaceful way to change a world that is marked by political interests and power games is especially difficult , " he said .
" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .
angela merkel , a christian democratic union colleague of koch and the party 's chancellor candidate has already hinted relations with beijing wo n't be as cozy should she , as expected , become chancellor this fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a tibetan monk prays behind the tibetan flag during a ceremony at in dharamsala in march to commemorate the 46th anniversary of national tibetan uprising against china .
" we can see from the u.s. example that one can , on the basis of a close relationship with china , clearly formulate the principles of human rights as well as cultural and religious autonomy , " he said .
" and i believe a national government here in germany should do no more and no less than to promote just that .

but , critics say his foreign policy there suffers from a glaring blunder - the lack of mention of human rights .

" i am referring to the g4 resorting to financial leverage and to financial pressures in order to induce a government to align , or not to align , itself with a certain position , or to co-sponsor or vote in favor of a certain draft , " spatafora said . in dramatic fashion , he threw his support behind a rival draft introduced in the general assembly by canada on behalf of the so-called united for consensus -lrb- ufc -rrb- group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the united nations security council that draft would enlarge the council to 25 seats , with 10 new non-permanent members that would be elected for two-year terms , with the possibility of immediate re-election . charging that an unnamed g4 donor country had terminated a development project valued at $ 460,000 -lrb- 370,000 euros -rrb- for a recipient country which sided with the ufc rather than with the g4 , the italian envoy said : " it is a shame ... enough is enough . " " reforms can not be dictated by power or money , " he noted .
" we have a moral obligation not to allow a reform of the security council to be decided in this unhealthy and poisoned environment . " g4 blueprint vs united for consensus resolution the contentious wrangling over security council reform has been debated for a decade and has been given momentum this year by un secretary-general kofi annan , who argues that the council is unrepresentative and reflects the balance of power at the end of world war two .
italy has long campaigned against adding new permanent members to the council .
a seat for germany would leave rome as the only big western european nation without one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g4 the g4 blueprint , which is backed by more than 30 countries including france and britain , calls for boosting council membership from 15 members to 25 , including six new permanent seats without veto power - one each for brazil , germany , india and japan and two for the african region . " the g4 model is structured in such a way as to benefit just six happy few , at the detriment of all the other 180 member states , and with a tremendous divisive impact on the membership , " the italian envoy said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a two-thirds majority is needed in the 191-member general assembly for adoption .
introducing the united for consensus resolution , canada 's un ambassador allan rock called it " the fairest and most democratic approach to the complex and controversial question of security council enlargement , while seeking the broadest possible consensus on how to proceed . " he said the draft would distribute the elected 20 non-permanent seats equitably among the geographic regions and would leave each region the decision about arrangements for both the rotation of the seats and the duration of each member state 's period on the council . the document is co-sponsored by argentina , canada , colombia , costa rica , italy , malta , mexico , pakistan , south korea , san marino , spain and turkey and is a clear attempt to drain support away from the g4 text , which is facing strong opposition led by the united states . g4 plan runs into trouble pakistan is adamantly opposed to india securing permanent membership of the council , brazil 's bid is opposed by argentina and several latin american countries , japan 's by china and south korea while italy leads opposition to germany 's bid , diplomats said . at present , britain , china , france , russia and the united states are the only permanent and veto-wielding members of the powerful security council , which also has 10 rotating non-permanent members without veto power . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meanwhile g4 foreign ministers met with an africa union -lrb- au -rrb- delegation led by nigerian foreign minister olu adeniji in london monday to try to overcome differences between their rival drafts on security council enlargement . differences centered on the au 's demand for veto power for the two permanent security council seats that would be allocated to africa and for five non-permanent council seats , including two for africa . on the issue of the additional non-permanent seat sought by the africans , it was suggested that the council should be expanded to 26 members , with the 26th seat circulating among developing countries of africa , asia and latin america and the caribbean states.the g4 and the au ministers decided to refer the issue to their respective heads of state . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de last chance talks for g4 un hopefuls diplomats from germany , india , japan , brazil and the african union meet in london on monday to thrash out what could be their last chance at agreeing a common strategy for expanding the un security council by september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc standing ovations for german tenor german tenor peter seiffert received standing ovations for his interpretation of the title role in richard wagner 's romantic opera , " lohengrin " , on the second night of the prestigious bayreuth festival on tuesday .
in a revival of us director keith warner 's spectacularly cinematic staging of the opera , last seen on bayreuth 's green hill in 2003 , the cast headed by seiffert was rapturously received . but when seiffert took his curtain call , the audience got to its feet , applauding and cheering wildly for his stunning performance as the mysterious knight . seiffert 's clarion-clear " heldentenor " certainly stood out in a generally mixed performance by the rest of the cast . his real-life partner , soprano petra-maria schnitzer , sounded shrill and forced as elsa in act i , and similarly failed to convince in the subsequent two acts as well , with her thin , one-dimensional singing and acting .
us soprano linda watson , tipped to be bruennhilde in next year 's new staging of wagner 's massive four-part " ring " cycle in bayreuth , sang the role of the wicked power-hungry ortrud with an unpleasant wobble .
the other three main male roles - king heinrich -lrb- reinhard hagen -rrb- , telramund -lrb- hartmut welker -rrb- and the heerrufer -lrb- roman trekel -rrb- - all appeared to be having an off-night , struggling with both tone and intonation . in the pit , german conductor peter schneider offered only a solid , unspectacular reading of what is one of wagner 's most magical scores , while on stage , the excellent festival chorus proved to be the real star of the show , always alert and expressive .
keith warner 's impressive staging has lost none of its magic , thanks to stefanos lazaridis ' visually striking sets and ulrich niepel 's poetic lighting .
and the evening provided an interesting counterfoil to the anti-aesthetic of christoph marthaler 's cold and clinical " tristan und isolde " that opened the 94th edition of the richard wagner festspiele on monday . dw-world.de wagner for the masses ?

consumers remain stubbornly reluctant to spend .
but the luxury sector is all smiles these days .
gucci and co. are booming . for large retailers who serve the mid-range market , the news just keeps getting worse .
germany 's general economic stagnation over the past several years has caused people to keep a tight hold on their wallets , a tendency that has hit most of the retail industry hard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karstadt department store one of the country 's biggest department store chains , karstadtquelle , lost more than 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- last year and its emergency cost-cutting plan cost 5,500 jobs . german brand names that have been fixtures of middle-class life , such as appliance makers aeg and miele , are cutting thousands of jobs .
relief does n't seem to be in sight .
germany 's main retail association , hde , forecasts the retail sector will see sales in 2005 decrease by between 0.5 and 0.75 percent over last year . but there is a bright spot or two on the current dark and stormy retail landscape .
in fact , it 's often glittering , sometimes covered in gold , and almost always features a prominent logo - it 's the high-end , luxury sector , which is enjoying a renaissance . " the mid-range is suffering , but luxury brands are in demand and people are spending a lot of money on them , " said ulrich binnebössel , spokesman for the hde retail association . luxury in style while the karstadts of the retail sector are closing underperforming stores , berlin 's galeries lafayette , the high-end french department store on one of the capital 's luxury shopping streets , friedrichstrasse , is adding another floor and plans on featuring more designer labels , which will cost a pretty penny . " we 're reacting to a brisk demand , " thierry prevost , the store 's director , said in an interview , adding that store sales had increased by 25 percent in both 2004 and 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model takes the catwalk on a recreated trevi 's fountain during the dolce & gabbana fall / winter 2004/2005 fashion collection , presented in milan , italy .
other high-end retailers report similar developments .
the exclusive quartier 206 , just down the street from galeries lafayette and housing names such as comme des garcons , dolce & gabbana -lrb- photo -rrb- and prada , reports double-digit growth . kadewe , the western berlin shopping mecca and tourist magnet , is putting the emphasis on luxury , seeing it as a way out of the general retail malaise .
the store has rebuilt its " luxury boulevard " on the ground floor , giving a more prominent place to designer names such as louis vuitton and gucci . " in general we have the feeling that high-end brands perform better than the broad mid-range , " said petra fladenhofer , spokeswoman for kadewe .
" the luxury boulevard has developed very successfully . " tourists eager to buy but it 's not as if berliners have suddenly developed a taste for the finer things in life .
the german capital is traditionally a fairly working-class kind of town .
with its high unemployment rate and serious economic enervation , the latest hermès scarf or helmut lang shoes are not exactly near the top of most residents ' shopping lists . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tourists stroll near the brandenburg gate in berlin .
but berlin 's tourist industry is booming and visitors are the ones who make up a good portion of the luxury shoppers .
at galeries lafayette , 40 percent of the customer base is made up of tourists . the same applies to quartier 206 .
the other 60 percent of their clientele , germans , generally have made a special trip to berlin to go shopping .
at kadewe 's luxury mile , a full half of those snapping up the one-of-a-kind , extremely pricey products were foreign tourists . most companies agree that the russians are the nationality most represented among these image-conscious visitors .
in fact , according to the berlin 's tourism office , the number of russian tourists increased by 22 percent in the first four months of 2005 .
many of them have money to burn and taste for the flashy . " most tourists come from eastern europe , russia and poland , and when they spend money , wow ! " said angela contzen , a spokeswoman for departmentstore in quartier 206 .
close on their heels are the americans , she added . strong at both ends , weak in the middle binnebössel from hde retail association says while the high-end is performing well , another sector is also booming : the discounters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not luxury brands , but wildly popular grocery stores like aldi and lidl , with low overhead , limited selections and cut-rate prices , are enjoying a brisk business . while he admits that germany 's poor economic climate has kept people from going on shopping sprees , according to him , it 's not only a lack of money that is drawing people to the low-end .
it 's a simple , and very german , desire to save on certain things , like food , no matter how much money is in the bank account . " it 's often the case that one drives with one 's mercedes to the discount store to shop for cheap , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the same phenomenon is helping the high-end as well , as the trend to mix and match luxury and discount items catches on , the " crossover look . "
shoppers save money on no-name jeans and a simple top , but then splurge for designer shoes or a bag . " and it has to be the ‘ it ' bag , very expensive , " said departmentstore 's contzen .

3 .
tehran , however , wants action before that date or it will go its own way . the european union will offer iran a package of measures in early august to encourage tehran to respect its nuclear commitments once its new president has been sworn in , an eu official said on tuesday . the package , which basically offers trade incentives to iran for concessions on its nuclear ambitions , will probably be presented in the first week of the month by the eu 's negotiating triumvirate ; germany , france and britain , after hardliner mahmood ahmadinejad takes office on august 3 . " then we have to hear the reaction , " the official said .
" we can not call for a round of talks -lrb- with iran -rrb- before the package has been presented . " the official , speaking on condition of anonymity , said talks would not take place until several weeks after the package is offered . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joschka fischer -lrb- r . -rrb- and jack straw the package , based on an agreement reached between iran and the eu has three key elements : nuclear issues , political and security issues , and economic and technological cooperation . the official said the bulk of the offer had already been shown to eu foreign ministers and was almost completed , but would provide no details on what it contained . iran wants action before eu 's set date however , iran responded to the news by saying the european union had until august 1 to present a proposal that would enable the country to produce nuclear fuel or tehran will go its own way , a senior iranian official said .
ali aghamohammadi , spokesman for iran 's supreme national security council , told state television there could be no backtracking on the right to atomic fuel . " we have told the europeans that there should not be any delay in submitting their proposals , " aghamohammadi said .
" after aug.1 we will make our decision . " aghamohammadi reiterated that iran had every right to master the production of nuclear fuel and that there is no way tehran will give this up as a diplomatic gesture .
" some minimum requirements should be considered in the proposal , " he said .
" otherwise we will not accept it . " " lifting parts of the suspension is part of the minimum requirements , " he said . new president 's stance on nukes still unclear bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : der neue iranische präsident mahmud ahmadinedschad grüßt journalisten vor einer pressekonferenz am 26.05.2005 in teheran .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .

" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .
the chancellor also argued for a lifting of the european union weapons embargo on china - in place since the brutal crackdown on demonstrators in tianamen square in 1989 - in a speech before the bundestag in april . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor gerhard schröder and chinese officials at a groundbreaking ceremony for a new mercedes factory in china in december 2004 . german companies have benefited .
on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .

both roland koch and rights activists hope gerhard schröder is watching . in maintaining his friendship with the dalai lama , roland koch lets few things get in the way - including diplomatic protocol . on a recent trip to india , for example , the premier of the southern state of hesse snubbed his hosts by insisting on a trip to dharamsala , where the dalai lama and his tibetan government have been living in exile since 1959 .
the seminal trip for any german dignitary did not come on well with the chinese government and the chinese ambassador to berlin immediately filed a letter of protest to the german government . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the tibetan people need friends " the move has n't seemed to bother koch -lrb- photo -rrb- , who welcomes the 1989 nobel prize winner to frankfurt for three days beginning tuesday .

" and it is impossible to walk it alone with out friends . "
german government vague on dalai lama the coalition government of gerhard schröder has been a good deal more dubious in its treatment of the tibetan leader .
it 's not hard to understand why .
praising the tibetan leader is akin to insulting the chinese , and schröder - at least recently - has been loath to do that . the chinese government has isolated the dalai lama , who turned 70 on july 7 , ever since it annexed tibet by military force in 1951 .
in 1993 , diplomatic ties between he and the chinese government dissolved and beijing unhappy every time he makes appearances abroad . schröder 's government has welcomed the recent high-level talks between beijing and tibetan representatives , but it seems more focused on praising the progress made by china . pleasing china spurred on , say analysts , by the promise of the massive market the middle kingdom has to offer , schröder and his government has come out with statements applauding what it says is china 's progress on human rights .

on a recent visit , chinese companies ordered 23 passenger aircraft and 180 locomotives from german firms . human rights groups have sharply denounced the chancellor 's unwillingness to address the country 's brutal death penalty , repeated human rights infractions , and policy towards tibet . following koch 's lead one could hope that " other politicians follow -lrb- koch 's example -rrb- , " said dirk pleiter , the head of amnesty international in germany .
" the approach by the german government , like most of the other european governments ' approach towards the human rights situation in tibet , is still too soft . " koch says that germany should model itself more on the united states in dealing with china .

" police investigators had argued that the law , which allows tapping of phones even when there is no suspicion of criminal activity , is an important tool in the anti-terror fight .
the decision is a victory for civil rights activists , who are worried that recent terrorist attacks in london and sharm al-sheik could lead to increased security measures at the expense of personal freedom . success breeds imitation such measures could come sooner rather than later in cities across europe .
based on the success video survillance equipment has had in helping london police track down terrorism suspects linked to the recent bombings , several european governments are mulling more aggressive public surveillance measures . in france , interior minister nicolas sarkozy announced on monday that cameras would be installed by the end of the year in more than 4,000 buses . sarkozy also said an anti-terrorist law , containing plans for video surveillance and collection of telephone data , would be introduced to parliament after the summer recess and is expected to be adopted before christmas . in germany , the city of berlin and the regional government of brandenburg have announced plans to add cameras to the existing network covering public transport and to maintain an older archive of video footage . " after the attacks on the british capital , we do n't want to be criticized for not adequately responding , " said berlin public transports company -lrb- bvg -rrb- chief thomas necker . rome , moscow promise more and better cameras in italy , which has been regularly threatened in internet messages by groups claiming links to the radical islamist organisation al-qaeda , a million surveillance cameras are already in place and the government has decided to install more and of better quality , particularly in the rome metro . bildunterschrift : these cctv images of the london bombers have led to arrests .
cities like moscow , rome and berlin and mulling installing more subway video cameras . the london attacks , which killed 52 people and the four suicide bombers on july 7 on the london underground system and a double-decker bus , have also persauded moscow to install a network of video cameras in its metro system : " within a year and a half every carriage of the metro will have one " , said the head of the moscow metro dmitri gaiev . surveillance of mobile telephone networks , which will allow authorities to identify callers , receivers and locations , will also be reinforced .
a number of governments , including france , have asked mobile telephone network operators to archive all these elements for a year , while stopping short of taping conversations . more police control over mobile phones similar measures are also being considered by spain , where police would also like to remove the anonymity of the 24 million spaniards and residents , who use pre-paid mobile telephone cards . this type of card was used by the bombers of the madrid suburban rail network in 2004 . mobile telephones were used to set off the bombs used in those attacks in which 191 people died .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 fighting for the heart of the spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pit frame in the ruhr basin : a relic from the past the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations . the furnaces may have been extinguished and most of the coal mines shut down , but the ruhr basin in western germany is still undeniably a working class region .
although workers gritty and smudged with coal dust are few and far between , the area ’ s industrial past continues to shape its people and landscape to this day . in the postwar years , coal mining and steel manufacture were integral to germany 's economic recovery .
in the densely populated ruhr basin , the heavy industry meant an almost certain guarantee for employment and economic prosperity .
from all around germany and europe , workers came to the coal mines and steel mills of the " ruhrpott " in hopes of making a living .
and for decades the region flourished .
but then the economy re-oriented itself , coal became less important for the country 's progress ; and a steady decline set in as companies folded , mines closed and the industry fell into a recession .
hundreds of thousands of workers were laid off . for the last two decades , the region has worked to change itself structurally , to wean itself of its dependence on coal and attract new industries .
however , the efforts have been without major success .
in gelsenkirchen , in the heart of the ruhr basin , one in every four people is unemployed today .
pockmarked by abandoned mines and industrial ruins , the conglomeration of cities is one of the poorest in western germany . bildunterschrift : steel workers protest closures in bochum just as coal and steel were integrally connected to everyday life in the past , it was practically a law of nature that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- called the shots in the ruhr basin .
for decades , the majority of the 5.5 million inhabitants between bottrop and duisburg , oberhausen and dortmund voted red .
even in the last state elections in may , when the social democrats saw their worst postwar result in north rhine-westphalia since 1954 , the spd remained the strongest party in the region . but the people on the party basis see trouble brewing ahead , and they are tired , worn-out from campaigning .
even longtime spd members are asking themselves if it 's even worth it to vote for their party - let alone rub their hands sore for the spd in the september elections . and if the core of the party is skeptical , what does that say about the spd 's chances as a whole ?
what do the grass-root members think about chancellor gerhard schröder and his policies ?
what are the expectations of the one-time heart of the party in this campaign ?
dw-world visited three spd members in the ruhr basin . christiane wolters -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the unionist it 's been a long time , but the memory is still alive .
as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore .
the young spd member sebastian kolkau heads up the young socialists -lrb- jusos -rrb- in gelsenkirchen .
he does n't want to accept the " loser image " of his party .
he ’ s even fighting for the spd in the pedestrian zone , where campaigning can really hurt .
the local chapter chairman the spd is battling a membership decline .
but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .
here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why .
the troubled red-green legacy hoping to trigger new elections , german chancellor gerhard schröder deliberately failed a vote of confidence in parliament .
dw-world looks at the record of his red-green coalition government so far .

spd presents election manifesto election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 fighting for the heart of the spd großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a pit frame in the ruhr basin : a relic from the past the spd faces a potential disaster in the elections , not surprising according to the party 's grass roots core .
dw looks at the party 's heart in the ruhr basin and talks to members about their expectations . the furnaces may have been extinguished and most of the coal mines shut down , but the ruhr basin in western germany is still undeniably a working class region .
although workers gritty and smudged with coal dust are few and far between , the area ’ s industrial past continues to shape its people and landscape to this day . in the postwar years , coal mining and steel manufacture were integral to germany 's economic recovery .
in the densely populated ruhr basin , the heavy industry meant an almost certain guarantee for employment and economic prosperity .
from all around germany and europe , workers came to the coal mines and steel mills of the " ruhrpott " in hopes of making a living .
and for decades the region flourished .
but then the economy re-oriented itself , coal became less important for the country 's progress ; and a steady decline set in as companies folded , mines closed and the industry fell into a recession .
hundreds of thousands of workers were laid off . for the last two decades , the region has worked to change itself structurally , to wean itself of its dependence on coal and attract new industries .
however , the efforts have been without major success .
in gelsenkirchen , in the heart of the ruhr basin , one in every four people is unemployed today .
pockmarked by abandoned mines and industrial ruins , the conglomeration of cities is one of the poorest in western germany . bildunterschrift : steel workers protest closures in bochum just as coal and steel were integrally connected to everyday life in the past , it was practically a law of nature that the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- called the shots in the ruhr basin .
for decades , the majority of the 5.5 million inhabitants between bottrop and duisburg , oberhausen and dortmund voted red .
even in the last state elections in may , when the social democrats saw their worst postwar result in north rhine-westphalia since 1954 , the spd remained the strongest party in the region . but the people on the party basis see trouble brewing ahead , and they are tired , worn-out from campaigning .
even longtime spd members are asking themselves if it 's even worth it to vote for their party - let alone rub their hands sore for the spd in the september elections . and if the core of the party is skeptical , what does that say about the spd 's chances as a whole ?
what do the grass-root members think about chancellor gerhard schröder and his policies ?

as a boy , dietmar bartsch enthusiastically ran behind willy brandt 's campaign bus .
today , he asks himself if the spd is even his party anymore . dietmar bartsch is n't used to asking himself such questions .
for a long time , there was no room for doubt : he was a member of the social democrats and he voted the party line . the 42-year-old miner has been an active unionist and a member of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- for 18 years .
one thing led to another - " the usual stuff , " said bartsch referring to how he first got involved in the party . what used to be " usual " in the ruhr basin has increasingly turned into the exception .
in the 1950s , some 500,000 people worked in coal mining ; and party activism was simply part of the working class culture .
today , that number has shrunk to 40,000 .
and even fewer people are interested in getting politically involved . voter turnout in the region leaves much to be desired - and the spd feels the decline most of all .
in the past , everything ran like a well-oiled machine .
today , the party has trouble mobilizing its once regular voters : the miners and factory workers . no more hands-on work bartsch has witnessed first-hand the changes .

bartsch was at an spd meeting in his hometown of recklinghausen .
and , as is the case whenever " comrades " meet these days , all talk was focused on the upcoming early elections in september .
bartsch says he feels " a mixture of resignation and hope " in view of yet another election campaign , just two months after losing the state elections in north rhine-westphalia . " no one seriously expects a victory , " he sighs .
" but what else can we do ? "
he acknowledges that politicians do n't know what is happening at the party basis - and how should they ?
" has any of them ever really gotten their hands dirty ? " nonetheless , the unionist and long-time spd member concedes that reforms are necessary and will continue to be important for the future . lots of " basta , " little substance but bartsch criticizes party heads for the approach they take to problem-solving .
all too often they resort to a knee-jerk , " basta " -lrb- the italian word for " that 's enough " -rrb- policy when caught in a tight spot .
reforms should n't be a form of " basta " politics from above , bartsch says .
the party leaders need to take people 's fears seriously and spend time explaining policies to them . the spd is lacking the right people for this right now , bartsch laments .
gone are the days of the great party figureheads like willy brandt , herbert wehner or helmut schmidt , " who had a social democrat heart and proudly wore it on their sleeve . " still , bartsch he will campaign for the spd , which is still his party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de election 2005 -pipe- 27.07.2005 the new face of germany abroad ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhardt could well be stepping into joschka fischer 's shoes wolfgang gerhardt , frontrunner for foreign minister under angela merkel , meets jack straw in london wednesday .
he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .

gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .

following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .

" tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .

he wants stronger ties to britain and the new eu members , marking a shift in germany 's foreign policy . wolfgang gerhardt , the foreign policy spokesman for the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , may not be widely known abroad .
but , that could change soon . gerhardt , 62 , is widely tipped to become germany 's next foreign minister after federal polls in september , expected to bring christian democrat union leader angela merkel into power , and their loyal fdp with them as coalition partners . in anticipation of what polls are showing could be a clear victory for the cdu , gerhardt already seems to be warming up for his high-profile position traveling to london on tuesday and wedensday and meeting his possible future counterpart jack straw . discussions will focus on the eu 's budgetary problems , membership talks with eu candidates bulgaria and romania as well as negotiations between the eu and turkey about ankara 's membership bid . a break with the past on all three , gerhardt 's stance marks a break with that adopted by chancellor gerhard schröder 's social democratic-green party coalition in recent years . " the german-french relationship was the driving force in the western european union but we have an enlarged union now , " gerhardt said in an interview with reuters this week .
" we need more contacts with the united kingdom .
we need a little bit of more openness to the east , to poland and others . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac with angela merkel in paris his comments come on the heels of merkel 's visit to france where she demonstratively called for an overhaul of the franco-german alliance , signaling that a future government would move away from the cozy ties cultivated by schröder . the fdp 's pro-market stance is a reflection of attitudes among the british leadership as well as the new eu member states . gerhardt is also a strong proponent of britain 's calls for slashing generous agricultural subsidies in the eu and moving away from the bloc 's long-standing emphasis on social protection . " tony blair is right , the budget is over-occupied with agriculture , " gerhardt told reuters , adding that a deal in which national governments took on a stronger share of agricultural spending - so-called " co-financing " - could be a way forward . " we should take this opportunity now with the budget problems to combine this with the british rebate situation .
maybe the only escape is national co-financing , " gerhardt said , adding that france , the prime beneficiary of the eu agricultural subsidies , was largely to blame . influential reformist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans-dietrich genscher long-time kingmakers of german politics , the fdp has provided three of the country 's postwar foreign ministers , with hans-dietrich genscher -lrb- photo -rrb- , and his 18 years serving both social democrat and cdu coalitions the longest-serving .
with all signs pointing towards a continuation of that tradition in the next government , the likely successor to popular current foreign minister joschka fischer has suddenly become a name to reckon with . born in 1943 in a small town in the western german state of hesse , gerhardt , was the son of a german soldier who died shortly before the end of the second world war .
he grew up on a small farm and went on to study politics , education and german literature . he joined the fdp in 1965 and rose to the top party ranks in 1983 when he was elected chairman of the fdp parliamentary group in hesse .
gerhardt , who caught attention with his persistent calls for pro-market reforms and overhauling germany 's education system , made his breakthrough on the national front when he was elected to the federal parliament in the then capital of bonn in 1994 and was elected federal chairman of the fdp a year later . gerhardt is largely credited with sharpening the profile of the fdp in the ensuing years and came to be the unwavering proponent of liberal ideology in the party .
memorable domestic reform initiatives included liberalizing germany 's restrictive shop opening hours , modernizing citizenship laws and overhauling social systems and the red tape .
on the foreign policy front , gerhardt showed himself to be a strong atlanticist . in the run-up to the 2002 federal elections , a power struggle engulfed the fdp , with gerhardt finally compromising with fdp general secretary guido westerwelle and stepping aside to let him take over the party reins .
the party also fluctuated between its traditional role as a pro-business party and erratic attempts to draw in new supporters with populism . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fdp leader guido westerwelle during the election campaign 2002 .
as the fdp attempted to portray itself as a " fun party " in the federal elections in 2002 , at times descending into ridiculous gaffes , gerhardt continued to command respect for serious liberal thinking and continuity .
following the death of maverick fdp politician möllemann in 2003 and a damaging debate about anti-semitism , gerhardt gained in influence , outshining fdp leader guido westerwelle in his seemingly unassailable reputation . by the end of last year , following a party conference where gerhardt asserted his party 's demand for a transatlantic bent in foreign policy and a definitive " no " to turkey 's eu entry , german media was left in no doubt about gerhardt 's standing .
" the influence of former boss wolfgang gerhardt is growing in the former fun-party , " the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper wrote . turkey , europe could prove divisive the fdp 's stated foreign policy may chime with merkel 's cdu on most fronts , but there are potential pitfalls .
one of them is likely to be european politics , with several influential union politicians indicating that they would like the chancellor 's office to be fully in charge of the issue - a move that 's unlikely to go down well with a future foreign ministry headed by gerhardt . another sticking point is expected to be the future expansion of the eu .
the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the sister bavarian party of the cdu , has signaled that it 's accepting the membership of romania and bulgaria with gritted teeth but has ruled out any further expansion " for a long time . "
that sits awkwardly with gerhardt 's enthusiasm for new member states . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's eu membership remains uncertain but , the most potentially explosive issue between the future coalition members will undoubtedly be turkey .
while the union has said it will only be prepared to offer turkey " privileged partnership " of the eu , the fdp has said it wants to hold on to the possibility of entry .
" i 'm skeptical if turkey will become a full member , but i ca n't rule out the possibility , " gerhardt said recently in an interview with news magazine spiegel . the latter is also expected to be problematic for gerhardt 's insistence on repairing ties with washington , badly strained by schröder 's opposition to the us-led war in iraq , given america 's desire to see turkey in the european union . it certainly looks like germany may have a almost new foreign policy if the conservatives come to power in september .
but , in one respect , there will be no change , according to gerhardt . " we also wo n't send any german soldiers to iraq , " gerhardt said . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de election issues : what 's at stake dw-world takes you through the hot-button issues , explaining what 's really at stake in this election and how the parties line-up across the spectrum .

but this is not the case everywhere , as the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck proves .
here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why . the " squirrel campaign " was a success and dieter knappmann is visibly proud of the fact .
what sounds so conspiratorial actually worked according to a very simple principle .
every spd member in the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck was urged to recruit new members for the party in their own circles . " you really approached everyone you knew and tried to convince them , " says chapter chairman knappmann .
the plan worked .
following a wave of party departures three years ago , the local chapter in this working class neighborhood is proud to have swelled to 220 members in the meantime .
there 's also been a change in generations as more young people get involved in the party , knappmann explains . the spd in brauck is doing better than elsewhere , where many chapters have had to merge due to dwindling membership .
it 's all a question of roots and " whether you really want to be the advocate of the people , " says the 60-year-old , who 's been on the chapter 's board for 33 years . running out of breath knappmann looks forward to the election campaign quite calmly .
" our philosophy is that it 's actually always an election campaign , " says knappmann .
" a lot of our activities were already planned before we knew there would be early elections .
now , they 're taking place right during the campaign . " in brauck , everything is ready " from the stands to the assignment of the polling stations . "
but here , like other parts of the ruhr basin , the core base is tired .
following a rapid string of european , municipal and state elections , the chapter sees itself campaigning for the fourth time in just over a year .
" we are running out of breath , " knappmann adds . where 's the fire ? still , knappmann thinks early elections are a good thing .
for him , the ideal result would be a grand coalition between the spd and the conservative opposition christian democrats .
" that would be the only way to solve the societal problems , " he says . knappmann says he does n't understand other spd members who turn away from the party because they claim they can no longer identify themselves with it .
" we 're not happy with everything , but you 're either committed to the basic values of social democracy or you were just a follower anyway , " says knappmann . recalling an apt quote to describe the situation , the party chairman says , " tradition is preserving the fire and not revering the ashes .

here , people are joining the spd and dieter knappmann explains why . the " squirrel campaign " was a success and dieter knappmann is visibly proud of the fact .
what sounds so conspiratorial actually worked according to a very simple principle .
every spd member in the local chapter in gladbeck-brauck was urged to recruit new members for the party in their own circles . " you really approached everyone you knew and tried to convince them , " says chapter chairman knappmann .
the plan worked .
following a wave of party departures three years ago , the local chapter in this working class neighborhood is proud to have swelled to 220 members in the meantime .
there 's also been a change in generations as more young people get involved in the party , knappmann explains . the spd in brauck is doing better than elsewhere , where many chapters have had to merge due to dwindling membership .
it 's all a question of roots and " whether you really want to be the advocate of the people , " says the 60-year-old , who 's been on the chapter 's board for 33 years . running out of breath knappmann looks forward to the election campaign quite calmly .

" we are running out of breath , " knappmann adds . where 's the fire ? still , knappmann thinks early elections are a good thing .
for him , the ideal result would be a grand coalition between the spd and the conservative opposition christian democrats .
" that would be the only way to solve the societal problems , " he says . knappmann says he does n't understand other spd members who turn away from the party because they claim they can no longer identify themselves with it .
" we 're not happy with everything , but you 're either committed to the basic values of social democracy or you were just a follower anyway , " says knappmann . recalling an apt quote to describe the situation , the party chairman says , " tradition is preserving the fire and not revering the ashes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 27.07.2005 infineon 's troubles keep growing großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infineon has slipped far into the red infineon , europe 's second-biggest semi-conductor maker , will probably not make an operating profit this fiscal year .
the financial bad news comes on the heels of a corruption scandal . in a telephone news conference on tuesday , infineon head wolfgang ziebart said the " unsatisfactory results " were due to memory chip prices that have fallen 30 percent .
mobile phone manufacturers are also buying fewer components from the munich-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ziebart , ceo of infineon technologies " i do n't think it will be possible to attain a positive operating result this year , " ziebart said .
the company 's fiscal year ends in september . infineon had posted a third-quarter loss earlier in the day owing to both the fall in memory chip prices and restructuring costs linked to the closure of a plant in munich .
the company said earnings before interest and tax showed a loss of 234 million euros -lrb- $ 282 million -rrb- , compared with a profit of two million euros in the same period one year earlier . analysts had expected a loss of between 80-225 million euros .
the group 's net loss widened to 240 million euros from a loss of 56 million , much worse than forecasts that ranged from 75 to 187 million in losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profit and loss estimates among chip makers are difficult to estimate because chip prices themselves can change quickly , depending on demand .
all of the big players in the sector , amd , samsung and infineon , are struggling because of fierce pricing wars .
the german association zvei , which follows the sector , has recently cut its growth estimate for 2005 from three to one percent . but the german semi-conductor maker said it expected memory chip prices to remain stable in the fourth quarter as worldwide demand increases were matched by only moderate supply growth . scandal not to blame ziebart said the on-going investigation into the corruption scandal did not have any effect on the chipmaker 's performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von zitzewitz ten days ago , andreas von zitzewitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , manager of infineon 's core memory chip unit , resigned amid allegations that he received kickbacks of up to 259,000 euros -lrb- $ 312,000 -rrb- for arranging racing sponsorship deals .
another executive , harald eggers , is also under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks of up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- . ziebert said he was " interested in a thorough investigation of the matter " and assured the prosecutor 's office the company 's full cooperation , but he added : " i would have liked for both my colleagues and myself to be spared this . " dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de how corrupt is german business ?
corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt .
-lrb- july 23 , 2005 -rrb- infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .

mobile phone manufacturers are also buying fewer components from the munich-based company . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang ziebart , ceo of infineon technologies " i do n't think it will be possible to attain a positive operating result this year , " ziebart said .
the company 's fiscal year ends in september . infineon had posted a third-quarter loss earlier in the day owing to both the fall in memory chip prices and restructuring costs linked to the closure of a plant in munich .
the company said earnings before interest and tax showed a loss of 234 million euros -lrb- $ 282 million -rrb- , compared with a profit of two million euros in the same period one year earlier . analysts had expected a loss of between 80-225 million euros .
the group 's net loss widened to 240 million euros from a loss of 56 million , much worse than forecasts that ranged from 75 to 187 million in losses . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : profit and loss estimates among chip makers are difficult to estimate because chip prices themselves can change quickly , depending on demand .
all of the big players in the sector , amd , samsung and infineon , are struggling because of fierce pricing wars .
the german association zvei , which follows the sector , has recently cut its growth estimate for 2005 from three to one percent . but the german semi-conductor maker said it expected memory chip prices to remain stable in the fourth quarter as worldwide demand increases were matched by only moderate supply growth . scandal not to blame ziebart said the on-going investigation into the corruption scandal did not have any effect on the chipmaker 's performance . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas von zitzewitz ten days ago , andreas von zitzewitz -lrb- photo -rrb- , manager of infineon 's core memory chip unit , resigned amid allegations that he received kickbacks of up to 259,000 euros -lrb- $ 312,000 -rrb- for arranging racing sponsorship deals .
another executive , harald eggers , is also under investigation for allegedly accepting kickbacks of up to 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 60,000 -rrb- . ziebert said he was " interested in a thorough investigation of the matter " and assured the prosecutor 's office the company 's full cooperation , but he added : " i would have liked for both my colleagues and myself to be spared this .

corporate scandals at tv network ard , carmaker volkswagen and chipmaker infineon are dominating headlines and leaving many wondering if germany , once thought squeaky clean , is becoming increasingly corrupt .
-lrb- july 23 , 2005 -rrb- infineon management knew about scandal munich prosecutors this week confirmed that a top infineon manager took almost 310,000 euros in bribes .
the company 's management , meanwhile , has admitted to knowing about the affair since 2004 .
-lrb- july 19 , 2005 -rrb- infineon bosses under investigation the headquarters of german semi-conductor giant infineon and the homes of several company directors were searched by munich 's public prosecutor friday , a company spokesman said .

in a revival of us director keith warner 's spectacularly cinematic staging of the opera , last seen on bayreuth 's green hill in 2003 , the cast headed by seiffert was rapturously received . but when seiffert took his curtain call , the audience got to its feet , applauding and cheering wildly for his stunning performance as the mysterious knight . seiffert 's clarion-clear " heldentenor " certainly stood out in a generally mixed performance by the rest of the cast . his real-life partner , soprano petra-maria schnitzer , sounded shrill and forced as elsa in act i , and similarly failed to convince in the subsequent two acts as well , with her thin , one-dimensional singing and acting .
us soprano linda watson , tipped to be bruennhilde in next year 's new staging of wagner 's massive four-part " ring " cycle in bayreuth , sang the role of the wicked power-hungry ortrud with an unpleasant wobble .
the other three main male roles - king heinrich -lrb- reinhard hagen -rrb- , telramund -lrb- hartmut welker -rrb- and the heerrufer -lrb- roman trekel -rrb- - all appeared to be having an off-night , struggling with both tone and intonation . in the pit , german conductor peter schneider offered only a solid , unspectacular reading of what is one of wagner 's most magical scores , while on stage , the excellent festival chorus proved to be the real star of the show , always alert and expressive .
keith warner 's impressive staging has lost none of its magic , thanks to stefanos lazaridis ' visually striking sets and ulrich niepel 's poetic lighting .
and the evening provided an interesting counterfoil to the anti-aesthetic of christoph marthaler 's cold and clinical " tristan und isolde " that opened the 94th edition of the richard wagner festspiele on monday . dw-world.de wagner for the masses ?
celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 27.07.2005 -pipe- 14:00 utc standing ovations for german tenor german tenor peter seiffert received standing ovations for his interpretation of the title role in richard wagner 's romantic opera , " lohengrin " , on the second night of the prestigious bayreuth festival on tuesday .
in a revival of us director keith warner 's spectacularly cinematic staging of the opera , last seen on bayreuth 's green hill in 2003 , the cast headed by seiffert was rapturously received . but when seiffert took his curtain call , the audience got to its feet , applauding and cheering wildly for his stunning performance as the mysterious knight . seiffert 's clarion-clear " heldentenor " certainly stood out in a generally mixed performance by the rest of the cast . his real-life partner , soprano petra-maria schnitzer , sounded shrill and forced as elsa in act i , and similarly failed to convince in the subsequent two acts as well , with her thin , one-dimensional singing and acting .
us soprano linda watson , tipped to be bruennhilde in next year 's new staging of wagner 's massive four-part " ring " cycle in bayreuth , sang the role of the wicked power-hungry ortrud with an unpleasant wobble .
the other three main male roles - king heinrich -lrb- reinhard hagen -rrb- , telramund -lrb- hartmut welker -rrb- and the heerrufer -lrb- roman trekel -rrb- - all appeared to be having an off-night , struggling with both tone and intonation . in the pit , german conductor peter schneider offered only a solid , unspectacular reading of what is one of wagner 's most magical scores , while on stage , the excellent festival chorus proved to be the real star of the show , always alert and expressive .
keith warner 's impressive staging has lost none of its magic , thanks to stefanos lazaridis ' visually striking sets and ulrich niepel 's poetic lighting .
and the evening provided an interesting counterfoil to the anti-aesthetic of christoph marthaler 's cold and clinical " tristan und isolde " that opened the 94th edition of the richard wagner festspiele on monday . dw-world.de wagner for the masses ?
celebrities from the world over are walking the red carpet at the bayreuth festival .
but how do mere mortals get their hands on a coveted ticket ?

it will take a brave man to attempt to fill the void left by the now retired lance armstrong .
german newspapers think that that man will be t-mobile 's jan ullrich .
can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .

while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- .

they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race .

" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .

can the german take his chance now lance has abdicated ? now lance armstrong has retired from competitive cycling , future tour de france titles are there for the taking . the void left in the wake of the texan 's retirement leaves the field open for one of the many riders who have cursed their luck to be of the same generation of racers as probably the greatest of the modern age .
but who will be the rider who steps up and takes on the challenge next year and in the years to come ? if you can believe the german press than that man will be t-mobile rider jan ullrich .
according to glowing recommendations from the country 's newspapers ullrich , who again finished on the podium on the champs elysses on sunday in the shadow of armstrong 's victory , can take advantage of the open field to claim his second tour de france after a gap of nine years in next year 's race . hopes were high that ullrich could triumph this year for the first time since 1997 , but the german finished more than six minutes behind in third place when armstrong won an unprecedented seventh title in paris on sunday . german press heralds the age of jan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " now armstrong is leaving the course and the world of cycling is wide open for ullrich - from here on , it is up to him .
he just has to put a bit more effort in , as armstrong told him , " said the broadsheet die welt newspaper . the paper added that if it had not been for armstrong 's dominance of the world 's greatest cycling race , ullrich might have won " five or six times " .
he has been runner-up on five occasions . the top-selling bild newspaper was also optimistic about 2006 .
" if jan is spared bad luck and if he takes armstrong 's advice to heart , then everything should work out , " the paper said . armstrong advises ullrich on weight loss bild was referring to the texan champion 's statement about his most consistent bridesmaid , a statement that while offered mainly as encouragement could be seen as a barbed parting shot .
the texan praised the german but added that undisciplined summers and his carrying extra weight at the start of the tour had cost ullrich the chance to seriously challenge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a more disciplined summer training routine may not be the only change ullrich may have to make to take over the mantle of tour de france champions from his great rival .
he may have to find himself a more competitive team , or at least a more supportive one .
while the t-mobile team returned to their base in bonn , germany to a hero 's welcome , there were still mumblings that their leader had cost the team vital points during this year 's tour with his often lackluster performance . the under-current of discontent became mainstream when kazakh rider alexander vinokourov announced that he was leaving team t-mobile for the liberty seguros team next year to pursue his goal of winning the tour de france , adding that he could no longer ride in the shadow of ullrich anymore . vinokourov quits t-mobile in bid for glory bildunterschrift : jan ullrich with aleksander vinokourov -lrb- right -rrb- . " my goal is clear , i want to win the tour de france , " vinokourov , who finished fifth this year , told french sports daily l 'equipe on tuesday .
" so i chose the team with the best arguments .
it 's the most organized and the most experienced team .
they have the best riders in the mountains and are among the best in the team time trials .
it was almost a natural choice . " if ullrich plans to jump ship as well to achieve his goal then it may leave t-mobile more adrift in a sea on hopefuls .
and for the rider himself , it may not make much difference to the outcome of future races .
even though lance armstrong wo n't be riding again , ullrich - in whatever team colors - may still be haunted by his nemesis . lance could come back to haunt ullrich as coach armstrong may be bidding farewell to his cycling career but it wo n't be long before he returns to the tour de france to help boost his discovery channel team 's bid for future success by passing on his experience and knowledge of the world 's biggest race . " he 's already very involved , " said team manager johan bruyneel .
" it 's remarkable to me how much he is interested in the future success of the team .
he 's always telling me about possible riders we could sign for the future .
you 're going to be seeing a lot of him next year . " and armstrong could well be grooming a new generation of riders to thwart ullrich for the remaining years of the german 's career .
the discovery channel team has a wealth of potential yellow jersey riders waiting to step up . young pretenders ready for the challenge bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paolo savoldelli paolo savoldelli -lrb- photo -rrb- won the tour of italy in june while yaroslav popvych is a potential yellow jersey contender who won the race 's white jersey for the best placed rider aged 25 or under . " he did well for his debut on the tour , " said bruyneel of the ukrainian who won the world under-23 road race crown in 2001 .
" in general you have to be careful with young riders but he has been promising .
he managed to stay with lance in some of the final sections of the big climbs which is not easy . " for the first time in seven years , the discovery channel team will go into the tour de france as underdogs but the jury is still out on whether jan ullrich will be the favorite for the race in 2006 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de armstrong wins tour de france lance armstrong secured his unprecedented seventh tour de france yellow jersey following the 21st and final stage , his final race before retiring - a move that coses the curtain on an outstanding cycling career .

consultants have been appointed to assess the historical significance of pontcysyllte , near wrexham .
backers hope the landmark will join the list of unesco world heritage sites .
the list includes the taj mahal , the great wall of china and the blaenavon industrial landscape in south wales .
the aqueduct , built by engineer thomas telford , opened in 1805 and celebrations are planned in november for the bicentenary .
the 1,000 ft long structure which carries the llangollen canal above the dee valley is one of the region 's biggest tourist attractions bringing in around 250,000 visitors a year by boat or on foot .
two teams of consultants , examining both the aqueduct 's historical significance and transport systems , have been asked to report back by the end of september . "
gaining world heritage status would be of great value to the local community as well as a real coup for the tourism profile of the county borough " dr dawn roberts , wrexham council their findings will be critical in determining whether the aqueduct 's bid to be included on the unesco list - probably for 2007/8 - can move ahead .
pontcysyllte was first identified by unesco as a potential candidate in 1999 .
wrexham council is jointly co-ordinating the bid with british waterways , the structure 's owners , the welsh historic monuments body cadw and the royal commission for ancient historic monuments -lrb- wales -rrb- .
dr dawn roberts , wrexham council 's economic development manager , said : " the aqueduct represents a great historical resource for wrexham and gaining world heritage status would be of great value to the local community as well as a real coup for the tourism profile of the county borough . "
dr david gwyn , one of the consultants carrying out the evaluation , said : " pontcysyllte is already protected as an ancient monument and we are excited by the prospect of investigating its wider historical significance .
" the span construction of the aqueduct used an innovative technique for the time and , as a welshman , i am doubly delighted to be involved in this project . "
revamp telford 's aqueduct , which took 10 years to build at a cost of £ 45,000 , was officially opened on 26 november 1805 .
this november a year of celebrations will culminate in what the council is calling " a spectacular bicentenary event " at the site .
last year the landmark underwent a £ 2m revamp .

consultants have been appointed to assess the historical significance of pontcysyllte , near wrexham .
backers hope the landmark will join the list of unesco world heritage sites .
the list includes the taj mahal , the great wall of china and the blaenavon industrial landscape in south wales .
the aqueduct , built by engineer thomas telford , opened in 1805 and celebrations are planned in november for the bicentenary .
the 1,000 ft long structure which carries the llangollen canal above the dee valley is one of the region 's biggest tourist attractions bringing in around 250,000 visitors a year by boat or on foot .
two teams of consultants , examining both the aqueduct 's historical significance and transport systems , have been asked to report back by the end of september .

pontcysyllte was first identified by unesco as a potential candidate in 1999 .
wrexham council is jointly co-ordinating the bid with british waterways , the structure 's owners , the welsh historic monuments body cadw and the royal commission for ancient historic monuments -lrb- wales -rrb- .
dr dawn roberts , wrexham council 's economic development manager , said : " the aqueduct represents a great historical resource for wrexham and gaining world heritage status would be of great value to the local community as well as a real coup for the tourism profile of the county borough . "
dr david gwyn , one of the consultants carrying out the evaluation , said : " pontcysyllte is already protected as an ancient monument and we are excited by the prospect of investigating its wider historical significance .
" the span construction of the aqueduct used an innovative technique for the time and , as a welshman , i am doubly delighted to be involved in this project . "
revamp telford 's aqueduct , which took 10 years to build at a cost of £ 45,000 , was officially opened on 26 november 1805 .
this november a year of celebrations will culminate in what the council is calling " a spectacular bicentenary event " at the site .

surrey and sussex healthcare nhs trust and the brighton and sussex university hospitals trust were both zero-rated .
two primary care trusts - sussex downs and weald and east elmbridge and mid surrey - also had no stars .
but surrey ambulance and the ashford and st peter 's hospitals nhs trust both got the maximum three-star rating .
ashford and st peter 's trust was zero-rated as recently as 2001 .
its three stars were gained on achievements like 99.5 % success on emergency admission times and good standards of hospital cleanliness .
trust chairman clive thompson said : " we have made sustained progress towards these well earned three stars and this is a superb achievement . "
frimley park hospital nhs trust and queen victoria hospital nhs foundation trust both maintained their three-star ratings .
the royal surrey county hospital nhs trust is also celebrating after going from zero-rated to having two stars in the space of a year .
' difficult challenges ' surrey and sussex healthcare nhs trust , which runs hospitals in crawley and redhill , was given no stars because of failings in financial management and a & e targets .
lewes mp norman baker criticised the brighton and sussex trust the trust said it was working hard to turn things around with £ 30m having been invested in patient care and hospital services .
problems with waiting times , financial management and hospital cleanliness were identified at the zero-rated brighton and sussex university hospitals nhs trust .
chief executive peter coles said it was " not a surprise " due to " difficult challenges in the last few years " .
lewes mp norman baker commented : " those leading the trust now have to convince the public they have a plan of action to deal with these matters . "
sussex ambulance service kept its one star , while sussex and surrey 's six mental health trusts saw two improving , two maintaining their performance and two losing stars .
nine of the 15 primary care trusts dropped stars in the latest figures .

the 646 complaints said posters for the l word , which showed semi-naked women in body oil , were offensive , degrading and unsuitable to be seen by children .
it is the most complaints for a single advert the asa has received this year .
but the watchdog said the images were not sexually explicit and accurately reflected the show 's content .
the campaign 's four posters included pictures of women wearing knickers bearing slogans such as " girls allowed " and " hello girls " .
' playful ' they were advertising the second series of the us drama , which follows a group of gay women in west hollywood , and began on the living channel last month .
the asa acknowledged the posters had offended some people , but ruled that they were " unlikely to cause serious or widespread offence " .
living tv argued that the images were " not gratuitous or explicit but referred to the sexual nature of the programme in a playful manner " .
the posters were kept away from schools and religious establishments and did not contain anything the public had not seen on posters before , the satellite and cable broadcaster added .

he is one of the few surgeons in the uk who is able to perform delicate , but potentially life changing operations for young people with epilepsy .
he and his team at king 's college hospital in london use cutting-edge technology to pinpoint the precise area of the brain that is misfiring and remove it surgically .
bbc one 's " your life in their hands " shadowed chris as he treated two patients - sarah mole who is 18 and harry davidson who is seven .
high stakes sarah had surgery for her epilepsy three years ago , but unfortunately her seizures returned with a renewed ferocity - she can have more than 22 seizures a day .
sarah finds it extremely disabling .
" i ca n't go out on my own .
i 'm just fed up with it and just want everything sorted . "
we feel that we are sitting on a time bomb harry 's parents worry because his condition is life threatening harry 's fits are life threatening - they can stop him breathing - and ca n't be controlled with seizure medication .
the constant disruption in his brain means he has trouble learning new information at school .
in the playground , harry has to wear a red cap to make him stand out from his class mates so that the staff can find him in a hurry should he need urgent medical attention .
his parents worry what his future will hold .
tough choices harry 's dad glen said : " you deal with it because you have to .
it 's life or death stuff .
we feel that we are sitting on a time bomb . "
deciding whether to opt for surgery is a difficult one to make because the procedures are risky .
mr chandler said : " to think that your delving around within the skull could utterly alter that patients psyche , their personality , their ability to interact , communicate and function in society is really a huge responsibility .
" but in a way you are treating a person who has a disease process .
at some point you have to accept that you are there to fix a problem . "
before the operations could go ahead , mr chandler and his team needed to check where in the brain the seizures originate .
in sarah 's case , this required a two-hour operation to insert electrodes into the suspect areas that will record any seizures she has over the next seven days .
sarah 's surgery left her with permanent injury to her sight mr chandler said : " the scariest thing when you are operating on the brain is when you get bleeding that you ca n't control .
sometimes it gets very hairy . "
there is also a risk that nearby brain structures that control functions such as speech and vision will be damaged .
unfortunately , sarah developed a blood clot after the surgery that had to be removed urgently .
this left her with some speech problems .
however , the electrodes showed that her seizures were coming from some tissue that had not been completely removed during her original epilepsy surgery three years ago .
when sarah was well enough three weeks later , mr chandler operated again to remove this tissue .
the surgery was particularly tricky because of the scarring from sarah 's previous operations .
to have a mother and a father say ' you have given us back our child ' ... what a buzz that is mr chandler mr chandler said : " we went for broke in terms of what we were taking out because it was important to make sure that we got absolutely every last area that might be causing the seizures . "
the surgery was a success and sarah has been free of seizures for four months .
however , because of the extent of tissue that had to be removed , she has lost some peripheral vision and can no longer see things clearly to her right .
mr chandler said : " it 's never nice to have to talk to somebody about the deficit you might inflict , and even more difficult to see that a patient has got a deficit .
" every neurosurgeon has had to face that . "
for harry , the chance of success was lower - around 50 % - because it was not completely clear whether the area that mr chandler planned to operate on would turn out to be the cause of his epilepsy .
however , his parents decided along with mr chandler 's team that it was worth the risk .
during the operation it was obvious that the site in the brain that mr chandler had suspected was diseased was indeed the root cause of harry 's epilepsy .
one month on and harry has had no more fits .
glen said : " in every aspect he is a changed boy . "
mr chandler said : " to have a mother and a father say ' you have given us back our child ' ... what a buzz that is .
that more than counteracts the destruction and the grief that sometimes surrounds neurosurgical cases . "
your life in their hands will be shown wednesday 27 july , 9pm , bbc one .

tough choices harry 's dad glen said : " you deal with it because you have to .
it 's life or death stuff .
we feel that we are sitting on a time bomb . "
deciding whether to opt for surgery is a difficult one to make because the procedures are risky .
mr chandler said : " to think that your delving around within the skull could utterly alter that patients psyche , their personality , their ability to interact , communicate and function in society is really a huge responsibility .
" but in a way you are treating a person who has a disease process .
at some point you have to accept that you are there to fix a problem . "
before the operations could go ahead , mr chandler and his team needed to check where in the brain the seizures originate .
in sarah 's case , this required a two-hour operation to insert electrodes into the suspect areas that will record any seizures she has over the next seven days .
sarah 's surgery left her with permanent injury to her sight mr chandler said : " the scariest thing when you are operating on the brain is when you get bleeding that you ca n't control .
sometimes it gets very hairy . "
there is also a risk that nearby brain structures that control functions such as speech and vision will be damaged .
unfortunately , sarah developed a blood clot after the surgery that had to be removed urgently .
this left her with some speech problems .
however , the electrodes showed that her seizures were coming from some tissue that had not been completely removed during her original epilepsy surgery three years ago .
when sarah was well enough three weeks later , mr chandler operated again to remove this tissue .
the surgery was particularly tricky because of the scarring from sarah 's previous operations .
to have a mother and a father say ' you have given us back our child ' ... what a buzz that is mr chandler mr chandler said : " we went for broke in terms of what we were taking out because it was important to make sure that we got absolutely every last area that might be causing the seizures . "
the surgery was a success and sarah has been free of seizures for four months .
however , because of the extent of tissue that had to be removed , she has lost some peripheral vision and can no longer see things clearly to her right .
mr chandler said : " it 's never nice to have to talk to somebody about the deficit you might inflict , and even more difficult to see that a patient has got a deficit .
" every neurosurgeon has had to face that . "
for harry , the chance of success was lower - around 50 % - because it was not completely clear whether the area that mr chandler planned to operate on would turn out to be the cause of his epilepsy .
however , his parents decided along with mr chandler 's team that it was worth the risk .
during the operation it was obvious that the site in the brain that mr chandler had suspected was diseased was indeed the root cause of harry 's epilepsy .
one month on and harry has had no more fits .
glen said : " in every aspect he is a changed boy . "
mr chandler said : " to have a mother and a father say ' you have given us back our child ' ... what a buzz that is .
that more than counteracts the destruction and the grief that sometimes surrounds neurosurgical cases . "
